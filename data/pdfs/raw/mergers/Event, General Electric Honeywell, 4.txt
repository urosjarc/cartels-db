Honeywell  International Corp. reaffirmed its full commitment to its $41 billion  merger with General Electric  Co. Honeywell's  board of directors "expects that  GE will do everything possible to secure regulatory approval  for the transaction," the company said in a statement. Analysts looking at Honeywell's  options suggested that it might position itself to be bought by another suitor. The proposed acquisition of Honeywell  by GE faces serious opposition from  regulators in the European Union.

GE-Honeywell  Deal May Be Blocked
490 words
19 June 2001

Copyright 2001 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
PARIS (AP) - European regulators have reportedly recommended that the $41 billion  merger between General
Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. be blocked.

The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site Tuesday that the  European Commission's Merger Task Force said GE's efforts to win  antitrust approval  were "insufficient."

Citing unnamed people familiar with the deal, the newspaper said the task force will forward its draft decision to the EC's College of Commissioners for final approval unless the companies can come up with a different merger plan.

The EU must decide by July 12 whether or not to approve the deal. It has expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.

GE president Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published earlier Tuesday there was "zero" chance his company's $41 billion merger with U.S. technology firm Honeywell International Inc. would go ahead.

"The indications we have from the European Commission lead us to think the offer won't be accepted," Immelt told the French daily Le Monde, referring to the executive arm of the 15-nation European Union. The deal has so far failed to win clearance from European regulators.

"The percentage is zero," he said when asked to estimate the chances of a successful conclusion to the proposed acquisition, which would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Honeywell shares were down $1.50 a share, or 3.8 percent, and closed at $38.50, while GE shares fell 13 cents to close at $48.87.

Immelt is due to take over as chairman of General Electric when Jack Welch, who delayed his retirement to see through the Honeywell deal, steps down later this year.

Although the deal won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU regulators, who are reportedly demanding GE sell off billions worth of assets. GE has said the EU rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient.
In the Le Monde interview, Immelt rejected suggestions that GE's hints that it is preparing for life without
Honeywell were a political maneuver, designed to increase pressure on European authorities.

"General Electric doesn't want to transform this competition issue into a U.S.-Europe problem," Immelt said. "This matter is based on economic facts. We don't agree with the commission but we don't intend to run crying to politicians."

"We haven't withdrawn the offer because we haven't reached agreement with Honeywell and we don't want to do it unilaterally," he added. On Monday, Honeywell's board of directors reaffirmed its full commitment to the deal.

EU Regulator  Defends Scrutiny of GE Deal --- Monti Says Many Competitors Oppose Merger
By Philip Shishkin

BRUSSELS -- European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti defended his scrutiny of  General Electric Co.'s bid to acquire Honeywell  International Inc. and stressed that customers and competitors on both sides of the Atlantic have complained about the deal.

GE's $41 billion proposed acquisition of  Honeywell  appeared on the verge of unraveling last week after the companies and the  commission failed to agree about the remedies required to secure antitrustapproval.
GE's regulatory travails in Europe prompted various business executives and U.S. politicians -- including
President George W. Bush -- to express concern about the commission's handling of the case.

"This criticism is not only unjustified but also hard to understand since the case has not been decided yet," Mr. Monti said at a news conference in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana. "I deplore attempts to misinform the public and trigger political intervention," he added.

Mr. Monti reiterated the commission's belief that the combination of GE's jet-engine and financing prowess with Honeywell's strong position in the market for avionics equipment "could lead to less competition in the engine and in the aerospace sectors and result in higher prices for customers in the medium term."

Mr. Monti also dismissed suggestions that his staff was trying to trip up a deal between two American companies in order to protect their European rivals. "The merger has raised strong concerns among suppliers and customers on both sides of the Atlantic," he said. "Several U.S. firms have complained and took an active role at a hearing organized by the commission at the end of May."

Indeed, the commission says that some GE rivals and customers, particularly airlines, were reluctant to complain about the deal in the U.S. because they didn't want to go on the record and be called to testify in court should the deal go sour.

The European Union's merger control procedures allow for a greater degree of anonymity for complainants, who in the commission's eyes were simply too scared to speak up in court against a company as powerful as GE.

The U.S. Department of Justice has already approved the deal with minor concessions, but the commission has been pressing the companies to sell significant parts of their business. In the end, GE offered to sell several Honeywell units with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion and offered to introduce separate management for GE Capital Aviation Services, the company's powerful aircraft financing and leasing arm. (The commission has accused GECAS of promoting GE's equipment to the detriment of competitors and has sought a remedy that would render such promotion more difficult.)

But the commission deemed this offer insufficient and asked GE to either sell more of Honeywell's core businesses or come up with a more far-reaching remedy to separate GECAS.

The Honeywell  Deal: Who Asked Monti, Anyway?  --- Europe Did, Says EU Chief Of Antitrust, Who Works
In an Age of Globalization
By Brandon Mitchener and Philip Shishkin
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal
1,048 words

BRUSSELS -- European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti defended the  commission's scrutiny of General Electric  Co.'s bid for Honeywell  International Inc., stressing that the review is "a matter of law and economics, not politics."

But how is it that the laws and economics of the European Union look upon the proposed  merger so differently than those in the U.S., which has already approved  the deal? The answer has to do with the growing economic and political heft of the 15-nation  EU, and with the differing approaches to  antitrust taken by the U.S. and  EU. But it also has to do with the way globalization has made many of the U.S.'s biggest companies major players in Europe, too, subjecting them to a high level of scrutiny there. (GE says it does $25 billion of business annually in Europe and employs 85,000 people there.)

U.S. business executives and politicians -- including President Bush -- have expressed concern about the commission's approach to the $41 billion deal, which has been approved by the U.S. Department of Justice but is stalled in Europe because antitrust regulators there are demanding concessions that GE refuses to make. Mr. Monti called the criticism "not only unjustified but also hard to understand, since the case has not been decided yet.
"I deplore attempts to misinform the public and trigger political intervention," he said at a news conference in the
Slovenian capital of Ljubljana.

Whether the U.S. likes it or not, there are reasons Europe is treating the deal as it has. By law, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is obliged to review all mergers and acquisitions involving companies with combined world-wide sales of more than five billion euros ($4.3 billion) and with European sales of at least 250 million euros each, regardless where the companies are based.

"It's like if you live in a border town and you have a neighbor making noise at all hours of the night," says Dennis Oswell, a U.S. antitrust lawyer at British law firm Ashurst Morris & Crisp in Brussels. "Just because he's in another country doesn't mean it doesn't disturb you and you can't call your local sheriff."

The commission's antitrust department approves most deals after asking for minor concessions, but sometimes demands divestitures and has blocked deals it believes would hinder competition and harm EU consumers. Critics say the commission puts the interests of companies threatened by mergers over those of consumers. The
commission's response is that it is simply taking a harder look than U.S. regulators partly because it doesn't have the power of the Justice Department to demand divestitures or break up companies after the merger review is over.

In another contrast with the Justice Department, the commission doesn't have to go to court to block a deal. If the commission objects to a union, the companies can appeal to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, though appeals are rare, as companies generally believe judicial relief would come too late to be of any use. In any
event, the EU's top courts usually find in favor of the commission, though they have overturned some merger decisions, writing EU case law in the process.

Mr. Monti's recommendations on major mergers and acquisitions must be endorsed by his 19 fellow European commissioners, a kind of EU cabinet. And the antitrust department consults member-state antitrust authorities in

Page 10 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
a forum called an advisory council, which discusses every complicated deal -- and issues a nonbinding opinion -- before the commission votes on it. The council generally sides with the antitrust department, though individual governments have been known to criticize the commission's decision-making.

GE acknowledges that, before talks cooled last week, it had met with national authorities to explain its point of view ahead of an advisory council meeting on the Honeywell deal scheduled for Monday. It says its aim at these meetings is to answer questions and defend its final offer, not to lobby for the deal or seek to build political pressure behind it.

National antitrust authorities don't conduct independent investigations into mergers reviewed by the commission, basically relying on the commission's antitrust department. But at least one national antitrust official expressed skepticism about the commission's concern over so-called bundling of GE and Honeywell products in ways that could unfairly harm competitors. "It's not absolutely obvious to me there's an issue," the official said. "It's not blatant to me that the market power of GE engines is going to be easily extended to other markets."

At the news conference, Mr. Monti said there were "strong concerns among suppliers and customers . . . on both sides of the Atlantic" about the GE-Honeywell deal, adding that several U.S. firms "complained and took an active role" at a closed-door hearing in May.

The commission acknowledges that the merged company could benefit consumers in the short term by offering volume discounts and other favorable terms on packages of goods and services. But Mr. Monti said at the news conference the merger could nonetheless lead to less competition in the engine and in the aerospace sectors "and result in higher prices for customers in the medium term" if GE's smaller competitors were forced out of the market.

To win Brussels' approval, GE has offered to sell Honeywell units with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion and offered to introduce separate management for GE Capital Aviation Services, the company's powerful aircraft financing and leasing arm, which the commission fears will promote GE's equipment to the detriment of competitors. The commission deemed GE's offer insufficient and asked it either to sell more of Honeywell's core businesses or come up with a more far-reaching remedy, spinning off or selling at least part of Gecas, say people familiar with the situation. GE balked at the demands for greater divestitures and reiterated over the weekend its refusal to expand its earlier offer.

Honeywell  Says It Is Committed To GE Deal
By Matt Murray and Nikhil Deogun
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

19 June 2001

Honeywell  International Inc. reaffirmed its commitment to its $41 billion proposed merger with General Electric Co. despite skepticism toward the deal's prospects from both  GE and from European regulatory officials reviewing it.

Honeywell  directors met yesterday in New York to review their options, as the  merger agreement with  GE, which came about last October after Honeywell  spurned United Technologies Corp. at the last minute, appeared close to collapse. After weeks of haggling with antitrustregulators from the European Commission, GE submitted a final offer late last week, but said it was far short of what regulators wanted and unlikely to be accepted.

In a short statement yesterday, Honeywell said it "expects that GE will do everything possible to secure regulatory approval for the transaction." The statement reflected a slight degree of tension brewing between GE and Honeywell, where some board members apparently want GE to fight harder for the deal, according to people
close to the companies. Indeed, some directors at the board meeting groused that GE seems unwilling to do that at this stage, even as some U.S. business executives and politicians -- including President Bush -- are ratcheting up the pressure by expressing concern about the commission's approach to the transaction, people familiar with the situation said.

Honeywell believes "there is some chance, some small chance, that there will be some sort of accord," said one person close to the Honeywell side. Honeywell sees "some movement there, as more and more people speak up," he said. "Whatever it takes, [Honeywell is] telling GE that they ought to do it."

In response, a GE spokesman said the company is "fully committed to the final proposal that we submitted on June 14." In that proposal, GE offered to sell Honeywell businesses with $2.2 billion in annual revenue, as well as place management restrictions in its GE Capital Aviation Services unit, but said it would go no further.
Since that proposal was submitted Thursday, GE said, the company hasn't done any lobbying for its offer with the
European Commission or other officials of the European Union. Over the weekend, GE President and
Chairman-Elect Jeffrey R. Immelt said at a press conference that the two sides are so far apart that political
pressure would seem fruitless anyway.

The GE spokesman, Gary Sheffer, did say yesterday that GE officials in EU countries would be meeting with member-state competition authorities to keep them informed of the process as GE's proposal makes its way through the final stage of regulatory review, with a decision due by July 12. But he reiterated GE isn't seeking to build political pressure on the EU.

"We are doing what we would do normally in any case, talking to the member competition authorities, keeping them informed on why we think our final proposal is sufficient and answering any questions," Mr. Sheffer said.

He noted that GE had met with those authorities "before we submitted our offer and since then, and we continue to meet with them. That's a normal part of our relationship in those countries." But publicly and privately, GE executives have continued to say that they don't expect the deal to go through.

At 4 p.m., Honeywell shares were up $1.30 to $40, while GE shares were up 19 cents to $49, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The difference between the nominal value of the deal and where Honeywell's stock is trading has narrowed to about $11.70 a share, from around $16 a share last Thursday, partially on Wall

Street hopes that the European Union will compromise with GE. The other reason: Expectations that spurned suitor United Technologies will step back in and make a bid if the GE-Honeywell pact is terminated.

For now, GE says it doesn't intend to withdraw its offer to the EU, leaving the door slightly ajar as the regulatory process proceeds.

Under terms of the merger pact between GE, Fairfield, Conn., and Honeywell, Morris Township, N.J., both companies can mutually agree to abandon the deal for any reason, including antitrust opposition, without any payment. Such a "no harm, no foul" language is fairly common in merger agreements.

If Honeywell had unilaterally backed out of the deal for any other reason, it would have had to pay GE a termination fee of $1.35 billion. The breakup fee isn't reciprocal in this case, so if GE unilaterally backed out, it wouldn't need to pay a breakup fee per se. That is because Honeywell would be able to ask for far more than
$1.35 billion by suing to claim damages or asking a court to enforce the merger pact.

European Commission May Approve GE Merger

The European Commission may approve the $42 billion (UKpound 29.87 billion)  merger of US electronics

BRUSSELS, June 19 (Reuters) - The European Commission declined comment on Tuesday on whether there had been any new contacts with General Electric  Co , whose plans to merge with  Honeywell  International have run into European competition problems. Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres was asked whether there had been any renewed contacts about the merger after Honeywell  said on Monday its board of directors remained committed to completing the proposed $41.8 billion merger with GE.

"I'm not going to elaborate at this point of the procedure on where we are. You all know we are in the fourth month (of the  EU's four-month in-depth  merger review). The Commission has until the 12th of July to take a decision, so expect a decision in the coming weeks," Torres told the Commission's daily news briefing.

Honeywell said on Monday it expected GE to "do everything possible to secure regulatory approval for the transaction."

GE last week made a final offer of concessions to win European Union approval for the deal but it fell well short of divestitures sought by the EU.

PARIS, June 19 (Reuters) - There is no chance General Electric  Co's $42 billion buy of  Honeywell  International
Inc. will be  approved  by European anti-trust regulators, GE President Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview.

Asked by French afternoon daily Le Monde to rate the percentage chance the acquisition would still go through, Immelt said: "The percentage is zero. The offer is on the table but all the indications we have received from the European Commission make us think this offer will not be accepted."

Immelt said on Saturday differences with the European Commission were vast, and that GE would not negotiate further with Brussels, but he did not explicitly rule out the possibility that the Commission might change its view.

Mario Monti, the European Union Competition Commissioner, yesterday launched an extraordinary attack on George W. Bush, the US President, for interfering in General Electric's  $41 billion ( #29 billion)  merger with Honeywell.

Signor Monti said he would not be influenced by comments on the  merger made during the President's visit to Europe last week. "I deplore attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political intervention. This is entirely out of place in an  antitrust case and has had no impact on the  Commission whatsoever," he said.

Last week Mr Bush said he was "concerned" that the EU appeared to reject the merger, approved by regulators in the US and Canada, despite pledges by GE to sell aerospace businesses generating $2.2 billion.
Signor Monti said: "This is a matter of law and economics, not politics."

Robert Zoellick, the US Trade Representative, said it would be an "unfortunate result" if European regulators blocked the takeover.
The EU has until July 12 to make its decision, raising hopes that a compromise to rescue the deal can be found. (c) Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001.

Honeywell  still serious  about GE acquisition

Honeywell  International Corp. reaffirmed its full commitment to its troubled deal with  General Electric  Co. Monday, despite objections by  European Unionregulators with competition concerns about the $41 billion merger.

Honeywell's  board of directors "expects that  GE will do everything possible to secure  regulatory approval  for the transaction," the company said in a statement after the board of directors met at the company's Morris Township headquarters.

The board was reviewing "a broad range of contingency" plans related to the merger, spokesman Tom Crane said earlier Monday. Analysts looking at the company's options suggested that the high-tech manufacturer might position itself to be bought by another suitor.

The proposed acquisition of Honeywell by GE faces serious opposition from EU regulators, who have expressed concern that the combined company will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.
The EU has until July 12 to rule on the merger, but GE has said it is not optimistic about its chances. Honeywell, a maker of aerospace, electronics and automotive products, last fall was courting a bid from GE
competitor United Technologies Inc., and analysts said the company would benefit by entertaining that or other
offers.
"Looking to a merger is probably the best way to get value for Honeywell shares," said Harriet C. Baldwin of
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc.

David Bleustein of UBS Warburg said that if the merger deal with GE fails and no suitor emerges, "Honeywell would face significant challenges," including restructuring its management to oversee an independent company after spending three quarters preparing to turn the reins over to GE.

The company also has a large base of shareholders who are expected to sell their holdings if Honeywell remains independent, he said.

Officials for Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp., which pursued Honey-well until GE swooped in with a better offer, did not return a telephone message on Monday. Meanwhile, Tyco International Ltd., another company mentioned by analysts as a possible suitor, said it had no interest in Honeywell.

Honeywell had already begun to streamline, announcing 6,500 job cuts earlier this year and making plans last year to merge its polymers and specialty chemical businesses and close a semiconductor chip packaging plant in California.

EC TASK FORCE REPORTEDLY WANTS GE DEAL BLOCKED

European regulators have reportedly recommended that the $41 billion  merger between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. be blocked.

The Wall Street Journal reported on its website Tuesday that the  European Commission's Merger Task Force said GE's efforts to win  antitrust approval  were "insufficient."

Citing unnamed people familiar with the deal, the newspaper said the task force will forward its draft decision to the EC's College of Commissioners for final approval unless the companies can come up with a different merger plan.

The European Commission has until July 12 to rule on GE's proposal to sell assets with $2.2 billion in sales and separate accounts at its aircraft-leasing unit to ease concern that it would dominate the aerospace products market.

GE President Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published earlier Tuesday that there was "zero" chance the merger would go ahead.

"The indications we have from the European Commission lead us to think the offer won't be accepted," Immelt told the French daily Le Monde, referring to the executive arm of the 15-nation European Union.
The deal has so far failed to win clearance from European regulators.

"The percentage is zero," he said when asked to estimate the chances of a successful conclusion to the proposed acquisition, which would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Honeywell shares were down $1.50 a share, or 3.8 percent, and closed at $38.50. GE shares fell 13 cents, to close at $48.87.

Immelt's remarks are the strongest signal yet that GE is willing to let the transaction collapse rather than offer further concessions, analysts said.
"He's ready to walk away," said Andre Chassagnol, an analyst at International Capital Bourse in Paris.
If GE does walk away, Hartford-based United Technologies Corp. could make another bid for Honeywell. UTC
had been pursuing a deal last fall when GE swooped in with a bigger offer.

Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I., said GE's top officers have made it clear that their final offer is about as far as they will go.

And Nisbet sees Immelt's comments as an attempt to up the pressure on Competition Commissioner Mario Monti to give his blessing to the deal on roughly GE's terms.

"I think he is probably goading Monti," Nisbet said. "He is saying: `Our proposed deal isn't going to change. I dare you to shoot it down.' "

Late last week, Jack Welch, GE's retiring chairman, said he was not optimistic that the purchase would be approved because regulators asked for more concessions than GE was willing to make.
If EU regulators reject the acquisition, it will be the first time they have acted alone to kill a U.S. transaction.

Page 23 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Immelt said on Saturday that the company was "planning our future without" Honeywell, and that it would not ask the U.S. government to put pressure on the commission.

But on Monday, Monti rebuffed what he sees as U.S. political pressure to approve the acquisition. The commission says the process will continue unless the merging parties withdraw their proposal.
With Honeywell's cockpit electronics and small engines for driving planes on the ground, GE could get more than
$20 billion in annual aerospace sales and rank No. 3 in the U.S. aerospace industry after Boeing and Lockheed
Martin Corp.

GE is the biggest maker of aircraft jet engines, and it owns one of the biggest aircraft buyers in GE Capital Aviation Services, known as Gecas. The commission has said it's concerned that the leasing unit might use its power as the operator of the largest leasing fleet to dictate what parts are used on new planes.
The purchase already has tentative approval from U.S. and Canadian regulators. Document hfct000020010711dx6k00kbm

GE CHIEF GIVES HONEYWELL DEAL `ZERO' CHANCE

General Electric  Co. President Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published yesterday there was "zero" chance his company's $41 billion  merger with U.S. technology firm  Honeywell  International Inc. would go ahead.

"The indications we have from the  European Commission lead us to think the offer won't be accepted," Immelt told the French daily Le Monde, referring to the executive arm of the 15-nation  European Union. The deal has so far failed to win clearance from  European regulators.

"The percentage is zero," he said when asked to estimate the chances of a successful conclusion to the proposed acquisition, which would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

Shares of Honeywell fell $1.50 to $38.50. The stock has dropped 21 percent since June 7 as concern increased the regulators wouldn't approve the purchase. General Electric's shares fell 13 cents to $48.87.

Immelt is due to take over as chairman of General Electric when Jack Welch, who delayed his retirement to see through the Honeywell deal, steps down later this year.

Although the deal won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU regulators, who are reportedly demanding GE sell off billions worth of assets. GE has said the EU rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient.
In the Le Monde interview, Immelt rejected suggestions that GE's hints that it is preparing for life without
Honeywell were a political maneuver, designed to increase pressure on European authorities.
"General Electric doesn't want to transform this competition issue into a U.S.-Europe problem," Immelt said.

"This matter is based on economic facts. We don't agree with the commission, but we don't intend to run crying to politicians.

"We haven't withdrawn the offer because we haven't reached agreement with Honeywell, and we don't want to do it unilaterally," he added. On Monday, Honeywell's board of directors reaffirmed its full commitment to the deal.

Immelt, who was in Paris this weekend to visit the Paris Air Show, told Le Monde that GE's position "is so far removed from the European Commission's that we don't think it's wise to make a political matter out of it."

The EU must decide by July 12 whether or not to approve the deal. It has expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.

On Monday, the EU's top antitrust regulator said the Europeans were not the only ones with reservations about the merger.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the proposed deal had raised strong concerns among airlines and aircraft equipment makers on both sides of the Atlantic.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said in a briefing Monday in Washington he was disappointed by the
EU's opposition.

"Obviously we're disappointed," Zoellick said. "The U.S. antitrust authorities approved the deal. We certainly respect the sovereign EU process in terms of its review."
"If it ends up this way, it's an unfortunate result," he said. Document ppgz000020010712dx6k00tg4

Honeywell  Hldr Criticizes GE's Handling  Of Merger >GE HON

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Guy P. Wyser-Pratte, known as a speculator in takeover stock, fired off an open letter to Honeywell  International Inc. (HON) and  General Electric  Co. (GE) critical of the way the two companies merger is being handled.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Wednesday that the Europeanantitrust enforcers have recommended formally blocking GE's bid to acquire  Honeywell,  moving closer to officially ending the companies' embattled quest for regulatory approval,  people familiar with the situation said.
In a letter reproduced as a press release, Wyser-Pratte, who describes himself as "a large shareholder of
Honeywell," accuses GE of "running out the clock" on a merger it seems to believe is dead.

Wyser-Pratte calls upon Honeywell's management to pursue the issue of whether GE is failing to propose or accept undertakings that would allow the European Union to approve the merger and whether GE is living up to its obligations under the merger agreement.
The letter, which is also sharply critical of European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, suggests that
Honeywell's primary responsibility is to "vigorously hold GE accountable under the merger agreement."

A spokesman for Honeywell said the company wasn't going to comment on the letter except to say "we are still committed to the merger, and we expect GE to keep working with the EU to close the transaction."
Representatives of GE weren't immediately available to comment.

Honeywell's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed at $37.04, down $1.46, or 3.8%, on composite volume of 16.8 million shares. Average daily volume is 7.38 million shares.

GE's NYSE-listed shares ended the day at $50.77, up $1.90, or 3.9%, on composite volume of 29.5 million shares. Average daily volume is 22 million shares.

Senate Antitrust Panel Outlines  Aggressive Agenda
By Mark Wigfield
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Dow Jones News Service
DJ

(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The Senate Judiciary Committee's  Antitrust Subcommittee set an aggressive agenda for the remainder of the year, with a focus on aviation, telecommunications, oil and international  antitrust cooperation.

In a clear reference to the European Commission's expected  rejection of the merger between General            Electric Co. (GE) and Honeywell  International Inc. (HON), a statement from the committee said the panel "will work to ensure that American companies are treated fairly and in a nondiscriminatory fashion when their transactions are reviewed by foreign antitrust authorities including the  European Commission." The Justice Department had  approved  the merger.

The announcement was made jointly by the chairman, Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisc., and Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, indicating continued bipartisan leadership in the wake of the switch of control in the Senate from Republican to Democrat.

The two said they would continue to "closely examine proposed airline mergers and their likely effects on competition." They will "continue to scrutinize allegations of predatory practices within the industry."

The Justice Department is seen as likely to block a merger between UAL Corp.'s (UAL) United Airlines and U.S. Airways Group Inc. (U). The agency hasn't announced whether it will appeal a federal court's decision to throw out a predatory-pricing suit against AMR Corp.'s (AMR) American Airlines.

In telecommunications, Kohl and DeWine said they would focus on speeding local telephone competition and diversity in media ownership, two issues that are in play because of deregulatory legislation and rule changes at the Federal Communications Commission. They also mentioned the satellite video market, where talks continue regarding a merger between one dominant player DirecTV, a unit of General Motors (GM), and the others - Echostar Communications Corp. (DISH) or News Corp. Ltd. (NWS).

The panel's goal regarding the oil market "will be to work toward increasing competition in the oil industry as a means of restraining prices," the announcement said. The senators said they would push a bill - dubbed "NOPEC" - that could allow the Justice Department to file antitrust suits against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC.

In health care, the panel said it will focus on bringing generic drugs to the market quickly and the effect of hospital group purchasing on innovative medical-device manufacturers. The senators will also examine anticompetitive practices in education - ranging from price-fixing by milk distributors for school lunches to college financial-aid arrangements.

BOB SELLERS, anchor: With each passing day, the news seems to be getting worse for the  GE-Honeywell        merger. We've now learned that  European regulators have, in fact, recommended this $41 billion deal be blocked. But when will it be official? Leslie Laroche has been following this story for us and she joins us from London with the latest.
Good morning.
LESLIE LAROCHE reporting:

Good morning, Bob. Well, the news this morning is that the European Commission has apparently recommended formally blocking GE's takeover bid to take over Honeywell. Now according to our partners at The Wall Street Journal, a draft review by the European antitrust team concludes that GE's concessions were insufficient to win a European OK on the deal. And reportedly, last Thursday EC Competition Commissioner Mario Monti asked GE to withdraw its application for antitrust approval so the Europeans wouldn't have to reject it. Now reportedly GE was willing to do that but Honeywell wanted to pursue the application.
So, Bob, that's the latest we know from London. Back to you. SELLERS: All right, Leslie. Thank you.

Much of the uncertainty in stock markets recently has come from the revelation by General Electric  (GE) that trustbusters at the EuropeanCommission (EC) are likely to block its  merger with Honeywell.  If that happens, it won't be the first time the EC has done it; the EC declared the WorldCom-Sprint merger illegal last June. But it would be the first time it has blocked a major merger after U.S.  antitrust officials approved  it.

The EC's obstructionism could set a negative precedent. Multinationals increasingly could face the burdens, punishments and irrational demands of foreign trustbusters as well as domestic ones. That's not entirely new. In recent years antitrust officials from major nations have sought to extend  competition laws globally. But now their blockades against greater efficiency and profitability could widen and intensify.

Like other corporate acquirers in the United States, GE should have a constitutionally-protected right to make any offer it wishes to Honeywell shareholders, without statist interference. But antitrust law forces it to bow and scrape before envious, incompetent bureaucrats. GE is left trying to secure its rights with payments of tribute. For example, to gain approval from U.S. trustbusters last month, GE had to divest Honeywell's military helicopter engine unit (worth US$200-million in revenues) and give engine maintenance work to a competitor. Such unjust and unprofitable mandates are typical of the tactics used by U.S. trustbusters.

Likewise, the EC has demanded that GE sell all of Honeywell's aerospace assets (worth annual revenues of US$2.2-billion). GE agreed. Then the EC required GE to divest or severely emasculate its ownership of GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), an aircraft-leasing subsidiary and one of its largest sources of profit. To his credit, GE chairman Jack Welch balked at that demand -- and has refused to make further concessions.

In making these demands, the EC has sought to favour European companies and rivals of GE. Some of the divested pieces would go to European aircraft firms such as France's Snecma and to rivals such as Britain's Rolls Royce and U.S.-based United Technologies. Airbus Industries -- the plane manufacturer owned by a consortium
of European governments -- also has demanded that the EC impose burdens on GE. This is antitrust law in the service of blatantly statist and protectionist goals. A decision by the EC against GE-Honeywell could cause a wave of retaliatory moves. And even if the EC approves the merger, we'll likely witness yet another example of a
major merger failing to deliver the benefits expected initially, due not to the faults of the merger makers, but of the merger breakers.

Contrary to the claims of trustbusters, the activities of trustbusters do not promote competition, low prices, consumer choice, innovation, prosperity or "economic justice." Their aim is to punish great companies and protect or subsidize inferior ones. In the process, they usually require, as a condition for approving a deal, that superior companies divest profitable operations -- often at a discount to market value -- to rivals and laggards alike.
Instead of promoting prosperity, profitability or justice, it constrains or destroys them.

The man directly responsible for the EC's position on GE -- and on other multinational mergers that might be attempted in the coming years -- is Mario Monti, the European Commissioner for Competition Policy. Mr. Monti is an overt socialist with a penchant for punishing business successes while protecting, subsidizing and coddling laggards and failures. He has recently noted, with some chagrin, the decline and fall of socialist regimes in the past two decades, and the trend toward less regulation and freer trade. He opposes this trend and says it calls for even more intensified and stringent antitrust enforcement than we've already seen. Mr. Monti seeks to stymie this
Page 31 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
pro-capitalist trend. In his view, firms either must be subject to socialist controls, regulations and protectionism or
-- if they are freed from such constraints -- they must be shackled and expropriated by trustbusters. Either way,
business can never be free of the state bureaucrat.

Meanwhile, Mr. Monti supports the notion of "justified" state subsidies and grants of privilege. "In certain circumstances," he has said, "where market forces alone do not result in a satisfactory provision of services, public authorities may entrust certain operators of services with obligations of public interest and, where necessary, grant them special or exclusive rights, and or devise a funding mechanism for their provision." He does not oppose the state squelching competition; on the contrary, he actively favours state grants of special favours, privileges, franchises, monopolies and subsidies to certain companies.

Mr. Monti's views on competition and antitrust enforcement -- indeed, the views of all trustbusters -- rest upon an inherent affinity for socialism, a suspicion of capitalism and envy for the most commercially successful firms. "I personally believe that this principle of an open market economy does not imply an attitude of unconditional faith with respect to the operation of market mechanisms," he said last fall. "On the contrary, it requires a serious commitment by public powers, aimed at preserving those mechanisms."

Fighting a pro-capitalist trend, socialist Monti wants to achieve a middle way, what he calls the "social market economy," which "does not stand for laissez-faire capitalism." He says "[i]t recognizes that a functioning economy is indispensable to produce the material basis without which human society with all its non-economic -- human
and cultural dimensions -- could not exist. Where no wealth is created in the first place, none can be redistributed. For this very reason, the idea is not to leave the economy alone to any development it might take." Whereas a
truly capitalist economy protects private property rights and freedom of contract, with competition as a trivial
by-product, Mr. Monti assumes that competition is the primary feature to be protected -- and is willing and eager
to violate property rights, free exchange and shareholder value in the process. Capitalists are mere slaves whose
product will be redistributed by looters like Mr. Monti.

U.S. officials have only themselves to blame for Mr. Monti's growing power to disrupt U.S. business and markets from afar. The world's first antitrust law was the U.S. Sherman Act of 1890. The next major law was the U.S. Clayton Act, establishing the Federal Trade Commission, in 1914. In the rest of the world, prior to World War I, antitrust laws were rare. After the World War II, U.S. officials simply imposed antitrust laws on the vanquished nations, especially in Germany and Japan. Eventually, the European Union mimicked U.S. antitrust law. In time, Britain and Canada did the same.

In recent decades a number of U.S. Congressmen (from both major parties) and antitrust officials have promoted, through legislation and treaty, the adoption and extension of antitrust laws in other countries. These new laws bolster the "supranational" powers of antitrust officials. Today, more than 60 countries have antitrust laws -- and more are considering adopting them, due to U.S. pressure.

The EC may well be retaliating for a recent intensification of antitrust enforcement by U.S. officials against foreign firms. In April, 1992, the U.S. Antitrust Division announced a new policy to intensify enforcement against foreign companies that allegedly injured U.S. exports. The results were stark. By 1998, 50% of antitrust defendants were foreign-based, compared to 32% in 1997 and just 10% in 1991.

On Friday, President George Bush expressed concern about the EC's actions and said he hoped it would alter its decision before finalizing it on July 12. And two U.S. Senators who oversee antitrust activity said the United
States and EC "have a strong interest in assuring a stable and clear legal environment in which businesses can pursue their activities. Uncertainty about either co-ordination or the legal ground rules will hinder the development of free and open markets and will impede efforts by U.S. companies to expand into the global marketplace."

That's true, of course. Antitrust law -- wherever it's practised -- creates a volatile legal environment that's hostile to business. It hinders the development of free and open markets and impedes the efforts of U.S. companies like
GE -- and really any multinational -- to expand into the global marketplace. The cure for this is the abolition of antitrust laws -- not their extension or intensification (or even "co-ordination") all over the globe. Having led the world into the quicksands of antitrust, the United States should lead it out.

GE president says deal with Honeywell  is over ; $41 billion merger shot down by EU

PARIS -  General Electric  Co. President Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published Tuesday there was no chance his company's $41 billion  merger with U.S. technology firm  Honeywell  International Inc. would go ahead.

"The indications we have from the  European Commission lead us to think the offer won't be accepted," Immelt told the French daily Le Monde, referring to the executive arm of the 15-nation  European Union. The deal has so far failed to win clearance from  European regulators.

"The percentage is zero," he said when asked to estimate the chances of a successful conclusion to the proposed acquisition, which would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

Immelt is due to take over as chairman of General Electric when Jack Welch, who delayed his retirement to see through the Honeywell deal, steps down later this year.

Although the deal won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU regulators, who are reportedly demanding GE sell off billions worth of assets. GE has said the EU rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient.
In the Le Monde interview, Immelt rejected suggestions that GE's hints that it is preparing for life without
Honeywell were a political maneuver, designed to increase pressure on European authorities.

"General Electric doesn't want to transform this competition issue into a U.S.-Europe problem," Immelt said. "This matter is based on economic facts. We don't agree with the commission but we don't intend to run crying to politicians."

"We haven't withdrawn the offer because we haven't reached agreement with Honeywell and we don't want to do it unilaterally," he added. On Monday, Honeywell's board of directors reaffirmed its full commitment to the deal.

Immelt, who was in Paris this weekend to visit the Paris Air Show, told Le Monde that GE's position "is so far removed from the European Commission's that we don't think it's wise to make a political matter out of it."

The EU must decide by July 12 whether or not to approve the deal. It has expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.

On Monday, the EU's top antitrust regulator said the Europeans were not the only ones with reservations about the merger.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the proposed deal had raised strong concerns among airlines and aircraft equipment makers on both sides of the Atlantic.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said in a briefing Monday in Washington he was disappointed by the
EU's opposition.

EUROPEAN REGULATORS TO REJECT GE-HONEYWELL DEAL: European regulators have reportedly recommended that the merger between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. be blocked. The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site that the European Commission's Merger Task Force said GE's efforts to win antitrust approval  were "insufficient." The EU must decide by July 12 whether or not to approve the deal. Earlier, GE president Jeffrey Immelt said there was "zero" chance the deal would go ahead.
BANK  MERGER PASSES AGENCY

HURDLE: Federal antitrust regulators have cleared First Union Corp.'s proposed $13.3-billion acquisition of Wachovia Corp., one of several hurdles the two banks need to clear before they can merge. The Federal Trade Commission ruled the deal would not violate antitrust laws. The proposal now goes before the Federal Reserve Board. Wachovia's shareholders will vote by proxy until Aug. 3. First Union's deal is worth $67.28 a share to Wachovia stockholders, based on Tuesday's closing price of $33.64. SunTrust Banks' rival offer is worth $67.72, based on a Tuesday close of
$62.65.

FEDEX-POSTAL VENTURE UNDER WAY: Nationwide installation of Federal Express drop boxes at post offices is under way. Under the business alliance announced in January, FedEx will carry Express, Priority and first-class mail on its national aviation system while placing its collection boxes outside postal facilities. Depending on the final number of drop boxes placed at post offices, FedEx will pay the Postal Service between $126-million and
$232-million over the seven-year term of the deal.

MAYTAG CEO HAS WHIRLPOOL ROOTS: Maytag Corp. has named former Whirlpool executive Ralph Hake chairman and chief executive. Hake, 52, previously was chief financial officer at Fluor Corp., an
engineering-and-construction company. Before that, he was CFO at Whirlpool, where he worked from 1987 to
1999. Maytag's stock has declined by more than half in the past two years as the maker of Hoover vacuums and
Jenn-Air stoves lost sales to rivals Whirlpool and General Electric Co. Maytag shares fell 24 cents to $30.59.

TEXTILE COMPANY SHUTTING DOWN: Thomaston Mills Inc., a 102-year-old textile producer, will close its business and fire its remaining 1,400 workers because of declining sales and foreign competition. Thomaston made the announcement to employees Saturday. The company has three plants, a sales office in New York and headquarters in Thomaston, Ga. All but 12 of the workers are based in Thomaston. The closings will be completed in August. The company, which has primarily made bed sheets and comforters in recent years, is considering selling parts of its business.

CLEAR CHANNEL TO RESUME WEBCASTS: Clear Channel Communications Inc. has struck a deal that will allow 250 of its radio stations to resume broadcasting over the Internet. Clear Channel had stopped Web broadcasting in April because of a dispute with recording artists and commercial actors, who wanted larger fees for radio ads that also run on Internet radio stations. Clear Channel reached an agreement with Los
Angeles-based Hiwire Inc. that will make it possible for Clear Channel stations to replace some national commercials with ads targeting Internet markets. A separate dispute with the Recording Industry Association of America over Internet song royalties has not been resolved.

MEDIA GENERAL CEO TO RETIRE: Media General Inc. chairman J. Stewart Bryan III said he will retire in the next one to two years as chief executive of the Richmond, Va., media chain. Bryan, who will continue as

Page 35 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
chairman, didn't name a successor for the CEO post. Media General's holdings include the Tampa Tribune and WFLA-Ch. 8. Media General in May named Tribune president and publisher Reid Ashe as its president and chief operating officer effective July 1.

TARGET TO OFFER SMART CARD: Target Corp. plans to install smart-card readers in its 990 stores nationwide by the end of 2002. The Target brand of Visa smart cards will be rolled out in the meantime. Unlike ordinary credit cards, smart cards have the computing power to act as hotel room keys, operate vending machines or store medical records. The cards also provide greater security, potentially reducing counterfeiting and fraud.

G.E.-Honeywell  Deal Update

JAN HOPKINS, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP: The latest on the proposed General Electric  (URL: http://www.ge.com/) - Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) merger, the European Commission issuing a draft proposal, recommending that member states block the deal.
Fred Katayama is in our New York studio with more.

FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: News that European regulators are recommending blocking that deal has sparked a projectionist outcry on Capitol Hill. Here`s what Senator Phil Gramm had to say at today`s Senate Banking Committee meeting.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. PHIL GRAMM (R) TEXAS: My concern is that we don`t end up having bad policies imposed on us, as Europeans try to protect themselves against competition, when they`ve lost competitive edge, based on their policies that they`ve implemented.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

KATAYAMA: And in a letter to the Vice President of the EC, Senate Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Jay Rockefeller warned that a decision to block the deal could have a chilling effect on future cooperation in aerospace and aviation. He also criticized the Commission for insisting that G.E. and Honeywell divest assets, despite approving many European mergers and alliances with minimal conditions.

Just last week, President Bush expressed concern that the merger would not go through-- but this EU legal expert says, one shouldn`t presume that this draft indicates the final outcome. The EU expert went on to say that he doesn`t think that the deal is dead. He says that it`s perfectly normal because this is a normal process for-- before the EU can come up with a decision.
Now, the EU`s 15-member Advisory Committee meets on Monday. The EU must make a final recommendation,
or decision rather, by July 12. Now, as for G.E., the company would not respond to the draft recommendation. But
a spokesman said, it would not pursue the deal-- without the blessing of the EU. Honeywell says it`s still
committed to the merger.

General Electric  (GE) has offered a package of concessions to the  European Commission to help it gain approval  for its proposed takeover of  Honeywell.  The concessions include the divestment of business from Honeywell's  aerospace division with combined sales of $2.2 bn/y. The European Commission is asking for more businesses with billions in sales to be divested including most of Honeywell's  avionics operations. Since the announcement of the possible  merger Honeywell  has reduced its annual expenses by around $600 M and reduced its global headcount by 10%.

European regulators have reportedly recommended that the $41 billion  merger between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. be blocked.
The Wall Street Journal reported that the  European Commission's Merger Task Force said  GE's efforts to win
antitrust approval  were "insufficient."

Citing unnamed people familiar with the deal, the newspaper said the task force will forward its draft decision to the EC's College of Commissioners for final approval unless the companies can come up with a different merger plan.

The EU must decide by July 12 whether or not to approve the deal. It has expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.

GE president Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published earlier Tuesday there was "zero" chance his company's $41 billion merger with U.S. technology firm Honeywell International Inc. would go ahead.

In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Honeywell shares were down $1.50 a share, or 3.8 percent, and closed at $38.50, while GE shares fell 13 cents to close at $48.87.

Immelt is due to take over as chairman of General Electric when Jack Welch, who delayed his retirement to see through the Honeywell deal, steps down later this year.

Although the deal won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU regulators, who are reportedly demanding GE sell off billions worth of assets. GE has said the EU rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient.

Commentary: How economic globalization will give foreign  officials more authority in domestic affairs

ROBERT SIEGEL, host: More bad news for General Electric's  proposed takeover of the technology giant Honeywell.  According to many reports from Europe, regulators there have recommended that the  merger be blocked. The  European Union must make its final decision by July 12th. But news analyst Daniel Schorr says the Europeans  have already made up their minds and raised the ire of the Bush administration.
DANIEL SCHORR:
The Justice Department has OK'd the $41 billion General Electric bid to acquire Honeywell International, but
Mario Monti says no. Mario who? Mario Monti is the European Union's commissioner for competition affairs, what
we call antitrust. How did he get to say what two American companies can do? EU law gives him a say when a
company does a substantial amount of business with the 15 countries of the European Union. GE does over $25
billion in business a year in Europe and employs 85,000 people there. Having a European entity decide the fate of
two big American companies does not sit well with an assertively American administration.

In Europe last week, President Bush said, `I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected the merger.' Commissioner Monti shot back at a news conference that an attempt to trigger political intervention is entirely out of place in an antitrust case and will have no impact on the commission whatsoever.

In a sense, this dispute is a consequence of the trend towards economic globalization. With business more and more operating across borders, governments have more and more trouble imposing their policies and attitudes. Europe does not share America's deregulatory climate that permits vast media mergers and resists regulatory relief from surging energy prices.

How does a consumer fare in the merger controversy? Senator Herb Kohl, chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, and Mike DeWine, ranking Republican, have expressed concern about the hindering of open markets. Commissioner Monti says a merger would benefit consumers in the short run, but lead to higher prices in the medium term.

The American companies are refusing to make the divestitures that Monti demands, and as of now, the deal seems to be dead. This is the first time foreign regulators have blocked an American merger approved by the American Department of Justice--an unfortunate result, says US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, but living with dictates of foreign officials may be one price to be paid for globalization. This is Daniel Schorr.

Commentary: Dangers of a trans-Atlantic trade war following the European Commission's rejection of the planned merger between General Electric  and Honeywell  International

AARON SCHACTER, anchor: You're listening to the MARKETPLACE MORNING REPORT. I'm Aaron Schacter.

Despite US government  approval,  General Electric's  president says there's zero chance that  GE's $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International will go ahead. European Commission regulators have reportedly recommended that EU members reject the merger, saying GE didn't do enough to win antitrust approval.
John Peet, business affairs editor of The Economist in London, says before trans-Atlantic accusations start, US
and EU officials should consider the lessons of this case.
JOHN PEET:

Jack Welch, GE's veteran chairman, and George Bush are both probably wondering to themselves, `How on Earth could European regulators derail this all-American merger?' especially when America's own antitrust authorities gave the deal the go-ahead several months ago. If you ask an American, he'll say the Europeans have intervened because they are trying to protect the interests of Europe's big aeroengine maker Rolls-Royce. Aerospace is a controversial business. Many Americans remember the Europeans' effort four years ago to stop Boeing's takeover of McDonnell Douglas, which was partly designed to protect their own plane maker Airbus.

One consequence of this line of reasoning is that talk of retaliation is now floating around. Why not stop some of the many recent European takeovers of American companies, such as Deutsche Telekom's of VoiceStream or Vivendi's of Universal?

But before this escalates into another trans-Atlantic trade war, proponents of retaliation should realize that there's really no evidence showing that the Europeans have been acting to protect their own industry. And they should also understand that because GE's takeover of Honeywell would have been the biggest industrial merger of all time and because both companies have billions of dollars of revenues in Europe as well as in the United States, antitrust regulators in Europe have just as legitimate a role in examining the merger as the Americans do. The European Commission, which administers antitrust rulings, has a totally independent unit to examine mergers. It applies European competition law in a quasi-legal way, and its decisions can be appealed.

The real problem is not European protectionism. It is that there is a danger whenever more than one antitrust regulator is involved that they will reach different conclusions. The regulators in the new Bush administration seem to be moving in a laissez-faire direction; meaning that they're more inclined to let the market decide on mergers. In Brussels, however, there is a new zeal for antitrust activism, to force more competition onto the market.

Which side is right? It is hard to say. Though in the past, the Americans have often been accused of being too hard on antitrust and the Europeans too soft, not the other way around. But what is certain is that there will always be huge political problems when the two sides disagree. The lesson of this case is not that one side is protecting its champions against the other. It is that the regulators need to get together to agree on how they
decide what to allow and what to block. If they cannot do that, we are going to have many more trans-Atlantic tiffs over competition policy. In London, I'm John Peet for MARKETPLACE.

Newscast:  European Commission recommends pulling plug on GE-Honeywellmerger

DAVID BRANCACCIO, anchor: The European Commission today recommended pulling the plug on  General    Electric's  proposed takeover of Honeywell  International. GE refused to make the large divestitures demanded by the commission. The 15-member European Union must still make the final decision, but the outlook for the merger is dim. Is the  EU too tough or, as Economist magazine commentator David Manasian suggests, is the US too soft?
DAVID MANASIAN:
Jack Welch, the boss of General Electric, and America's most-admired chief executive, claims to be amazed.
`The European Commission's antitrust officials have imposed so many extraordinary conditions on GE's $42
billion takeover of Honeywell,' he says, `that the deal is now probably dead.' Mr. Welch's outrage had been widely
shared in America. What gives Europeans the right to block an all-American merger, which has already been
approved by America's own anti-trust authorities?

In fact, Mr. Welch should not be so amazed, and there isn't much cause for outrage either. A deal as big as GE-Honeywell is global in its effects and it's entirely reasonable the trust busters in Europe, where both companies have big assets, should also rule on the merger. They have raised legitimate concerns which perhaps should have been taken more seriously by American officials before waving the deal through. European officials also point out that they're ready to keep negotiating with GE. It's Mr. Welch and his company that are throwing up their hands. Many suspect that GE is secretly glad that the Europeans have raised objections because the deal now looks riskier than it first appeared to be.

This isn't the first time that antitrust officials on both sides of the Atlantic have come to different conclusions about the same big merger and it won't be the last. But obviously the number of such disagreements ought to be kept to a minimum, and the diverging approaches to antitrust on both sides of the Atlantic are a cause for concern. It may even get wider if, as predicted, the Bush administration is less aggressive about enforcing antitrust rules.

Both sides can learn from each other. But Americans ought not to assume that their approach is always the best one. For example, European authorities make their decisions in a timely fashion, and they're reasonably transparent about them. The American approach can take years. The IBM antitrust case went on for 11 years, and the current Microsoft case is beginning to look like another marathon. What's needed on antitrust enforcement is less outrage and more international cooperation. From The Economist in London, I'm David Manasian for MARKETPLACE.

GE-HONEYWELL MERGER LOOKS ALL BUT DEAD

The General Electric-Honeywell merger appears all but dead.

European Union antitrust officials have said they plan to "formally" recommend that the deal be blocked, according to several reports last night.

The news follows comments by GE's incoming chairman, who said the prospect of a General Electric-Honeywell merger looks bleaker by the moment.

The chances of a successful end to GE's proposed $41 billion takeover of Honeywell are "zero," Jack Welch's successor, Jeffrey Immelt, said yesterday.

"The indications we have from the European Commission lead us to think the offer won't be accepted," Immelt told the French daily Le Monde while in Paris for the annual air show.

His comments sent shares of Honeywell tumbling to their lowest levels since March as investors digested the hints that GE had lost hope of completing its acquisition of the industrial giant.

Shares of the Morris Township, N.J.-based Honeywell closed down $1.50 at $38.50 after falling as low as $36.70 earlier in the day.
Based on that price, Honeywell had lost about $3.5 billion, or more than 10 percent, of its market value since
Thursday, when GE submitted its final offer to Mario Monti .

Immelt also shot down reports that GE is looking to the U.S. government for help in getting the merger approved and said the Fairfield, Conn.-based industrial giant was in no way putting pressure on the EU to pass the deal.

"General Electric doesn't want to transform this competition issue into a U.S.-Europe problem," Immelt told Le Monde. "This matter is based on economic facts. We don't agree with the Commission, but we don't intend to run crying to politicians."

PARIS --  General Electric  Co. President Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published Tuesday there was "zero" chance his company's $41 billion  merger with U.S. technology firm  Honeywell  International Inc. would go ahead.

"The indications we have from the  European Commission lead us to think the offer won't be accepted," Immelt told the French daily Le Monde, referring to the executive arm of the 15-nation  European Union. The deal has so far failed to win clearance from Europeanregulators.

"The percentage is zero," he said when asked to estimate the chances of a successful conclusion to the proposed acquisition, which would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.
Honeywell shares closed down $1.50 to $38.50 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares slipped
13 cents to close at $48.87.

Immelt is due to take over as chairman of General Electric when Jack Welch, who delayed his retirement to see through the Honeywell deal, steps down later this year.

Although the deal won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU regulators, who are reportedly demanding GE sell off billions in assets. GE has said the EU rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient.

In the Le Monde interview, Immelt rejected suggestions that GE's statements were a political maneuver, designed to increase pressure on European authorities.

"General Electric doesn't want to transform this competition issue into a U.S.-Europe problem," Immelt said. "This matter is based on economic facts. We don't agree with the commission but we don't intend to run crying to politicians."

Failed deal puts tough twist on Welch book

The doomed General Electric  takeover of  Honeywell  has thrown a wrench into yet another big Jack Welch deal:
his forthcoming book.

The General Electric  CEO was planning to cap not only his career, but also his autobiography, Straight From the Gut, with a chapter on the  Honeywell merger. However,  GE President Jeffrey Immelt told the French newspaper Le Monde on Tuesday that odds of the $41 billion deal going through are now "zero," due to  European antitrust demands.

With the Welch book release date set for Sept. 11, a dash is underway to provide an ending with something more suitable than a gallant last-ditch failure.

"The manuscript is due imminently," as soon as today or Thursday, Warner Books spokeswoman Emi Battaglia says. She says the book is "still on target, not late from our perspective."

Rick Wolff, editor of the Welch book, was buried in the manuscript Tuesday and unavailable for comment. Co-author John Byrne, a Business Week reporter, also was unavailable.
Time pressure is enormous. Warner gave Welch a $7 million advance for the North American rights and must sell
700,000 hardcover copies to break even. Its only hope is to do that in two waves, the first this fall when Welch
retires and the second during the holiday shopping season. The first wave is crucial because Welch's retirement
will generate free publicity. If the book is late, the first opportunity will be gone.

Publishers are always in a big hurry when doing a celebrity book because they want to recoup the advance, says William Novak, co- author in 1984 of the best-selling CEO tale of them all, Iacocca: An Autobiography.At the same time, "Publishers often underestimate the amount of time these projects take," Novak says.

Iacocca sold 2.7 million copies, but the CEO genre has steadily lost popularity ever since, says Tony Schwartz, co-author of Work in Progress with Walt Disney CEO Michael Eisner.

Schwartz says he can relate to the frustration of last-minute news events. He had all but completed the Eisner book in 1994 when, over the course of a few months, Disney Chief Operating Officer Frank Wells died in a helicopter crash, Eisner had heart bypass surgery and studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg quit, then sued the company.
The book had to be almost entirely rewritten and came out 2 years late.

"A person like Jack Welch is likely to see this as his biggest statement to the world, the biggest he will make," Schwartz says. "I'm sure it's difficult to balance the deadline pressure with something he's going to be happy with
10 years from now."

This month at BookExpo, the annual industry convention in Chicago, Welch said Straight From the Gut had been difficult to write. "It is a lot easier to speak and leave the stage than to write and look at it in the morning," Welch said. "It's ugly."

Including foreign rights, Welch's total advance is $10 million, estimates New York Post columnist Keith Kelly, who covers publishing. That ranks Welch with Pope John Paul II for the record. Hillary Rodham Clinton sold world rights to her memoir for $7.1 million.

Wal-Mart Faces Discrimination Suit

Six current and former Wal-Mart workers filed suit against the world's largest retailer, claiming Wal-Mart Stores Inc. systematically discriminates against women in pay, training and promotions. The women, who filed in U.S. District Court, are seeking class-action status. If granted, the suit could cover 500,000 to 700,000 former and current employees of the nation's largest private employer, attorneys said. The company said in a statement that "the record is clear that there is no systematic practice of discrimination at Wal-Mart."

Tellabs, a Lisle, Ill.-based telecommunications giant, warned that second-quarter sales will fall as much as 40 percent below expectations as demand for equipment continues to plummet. The statement came after markets closed. Tellabs now projects sales for the quarter of $500 million, down from previous estimates of $780 million to
$820 million. Earnings per share will break even, excluding restructuring and other charges, the firm said, while analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted earnings of 29 cents a share.

Clear Channel Communications has struck a deal that will allow 250 of its radio stations to resume broadcasting over the Internet. San Antonio-based Clear Channel stopped Web broadcasting in April because of a dispute with recording artists and actors, who wanted larger fees for radio ads that also run on Internet stations. Clear Channel reached an agreement with Los Angeles-based Hiwire that will make it possible for Clear Channel stations to replace some national commercials with ads targeting Internet markets.

New York, California and Connecticut sued the Energy Department, contending that President Bush's plan to reduce mandated improvements in the efficiency standards for central air-conditioning systems hurts
energy-conservation efforts. The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court, seeks to block an April decision by the Energy Department requiring minimum air-conditioning efficiency standards to improve by 20 percent by 2006, down from the Clinton administration's 30 percent mandate.

First Union's proposed $13.3 billion acquisition of Wachovia was cleared by federal antitrust regulators. Shareholders of Wachovia, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., will vote on First Union's offer Aug. 3. Wachovia's board of directors has recommended its shareholders accept First Union's offer. Shareholders of Charlotte-based First Union are expected to approve the deal when they meet July 31 in Charlotte. First Union's proposed combination with Wachovia also must win the approval of the Federal Reserve Board and state regulators.

Companies: EU Regulators Recommend  Blocking GE-Honeywell  Deal --- In Draft Decision,  Commission Says Proposed  Remedies Are Insufficient --- Prospects That Acquisition Will Survive Are Rapidly Diminishing
By Philip Shishkin

BRUSSELS --  European antitrust enforcers have recommended blocking  General Electric  Co.'s bid to acquire Honeywell  International Inc., moving closer to putting an official end to the companies' embattled quest for regulatory approval,  say people familiar with the situation.

In a draft decision prepared earlier this week, the EuropeanCommission's Merger Task Force pronounced GE's latest proposals to win  antitrust approval  as insufficient and confirmed that GE's $41 billion (47.64 billion euro) acquisition won't be allowed to go through in its current form.

The draft decision means that the number of scenarios under which the deal could still survive is rapidly diminishing. It also signals that the commission is unlikely suddenly to change its mind about a deal that it fears could create an aerospace juggernaut capable of undercutting competition in the industry.

However, GE and Honeywell could still come back to the negotiating table and offer more divestitures to the European antitrust enforcers. If these offers satisfy all competition concerns, the commission could reconsider its determination to kill the merger. The deal already has been approved by the U.S. Department of Justice.

But GE's top executives have said repeatedly that the negotiations are over and they aren't going to raise their offer, officially submitted to the commission last Thursday.

In that proposal, GE offered to sell several Honeywell units with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion and offered to introduce separate management for GE Capital Aviation Services, the company's powerful aircraft financing and leasing arm. (The commission accuses Gecas of promoting GE's equipment to the detriment of competitors and continues to seek a remedy that would render such promotion more difficult.)

But the commission deemed this offer insufficient and asked GE to either sell more of Honeywell's core businesses or come up with a more far-reaching remedy to separate Gecas. GE balked at demands for greater divestitures from Honeywell and also rejected any measures that would leave it with less than 100% ownership of Gecas.

GE's negotiators argue that the commission's analysis of the deal has been based on shaky economic theories that have led it to conclude erroneously that the combined company would be able to push its weaker rivals out of the market.

The apparent divergence of opinion between U.S. authorities and their more demanding European counterparts has triggered a litany of statements accusing the commission of unfair interference with American business. Faced with this criticism, European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said on Monday that the commission's investigation "is a matter of law and economics, not politics."

Earlier this week, the commission circulated some of GE's antitrust remedies to the companies' rivals to get some feedback on their validity. This consultation stops short of an official market test, which would have indicated that the commission thinks the remedies could be sufficient. In fact, the commission isn't even mentioning Gecas as one of the remedies because it has already decided the GE's proposal for the leasing unit doesn't go far enough.

The commission antitrust enforcers are asking some GE competitors about the commercial viability of several Honeywell's units that GE has offered to sell. The commission still thinks that these units have little chance of surviving on their own because they are "carved out" from a larger chunk of Honeywell's business. "It's more of a procedural step," one person familiar with the situation said about the consultation.

EU regulators against GE deal, report says

European regulators have reportedly recommended that the $41 billion  merger between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. be blocked.

The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site Tuesday that the  European Commission's Merger Task Force said GE's efforts to win  antitrust approval  were "insufficient."

Citing unnamed people familiar with the deal, the newspaper said the task force will forward its draft decision to the EC's College of Commissioners for final approval unless the companies can come up with a different merger plan.
The EU must decide by July 12 whether to approve the deal. It has expressed concern that a combined
GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in such other areas as
aircraft leasing and avionics.

GE President Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published earlier Tuesday there was "zero" chance his company's $41 billion merger with U.S. technology firm Honeywell International Inc. would go ahead.

"The indications we have from the European Commission lead us to think the offer won't be accepted," Immelt told the French daily Le Monde.
In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Honeywell shares were down $1.50, or 3.8%, and closed at
$38.50, while GE shares fell 13 cents to close at $48.87.

Immelt is due to take over as chairman of General Electric when Jack Welch, who delayed his retirement to see through the Honeywell deal, steps down later this year.

Although the deal won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU regulators, who are reportedly demanding that GE sell off billions of dollars worth of assets. GE has said the EU rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient.

In the Le Monde interview, Immelt rejected talk that GE's hints that it is preparing for life without Honeywell were a political maneuver, designed to pressure European authorities.

"General Electric doesn't want to transform this competition issue into a U.S.-Europe problem," Immelt said. "This matter is based on economic facts. We don't agree with the commission but we don't intend to run crying to politicians."

The Wall Street Journal is reporting that  European antitrust enforcers have recommended formally blocking GE's bid to acquire Honeywell  International Inc., moving closer to officially ending the companies' embattled quest for regulatory approval.  According to the Journal, the European Commission's Merger Task Force deemed insufficient GE's latest proposals to win antitrust approval  and confirmed that the proposed acquisition will not be allowed to go through in its current form. If the two sides are unable to bridge their differences, the Merger Task Force's draft decision would proceed to the  European Commission's College of  Commissioners for final  approval.

Euro Commission to rule July 3 on Honeywell-GE merger
348 words
20 June 2001
Agence France-Presse
AFPR
English
(Copyright 2001)
BRUSSELS, June 20 (AFP) - The European Commission is to rule on July 3 in Luxembourg on the  merger of
US groups Honeywell  and General Electric,  a European source said on Wednesday.

The commission's deadline for issuing a ruling on the case is July 12, but in this type of case it normally hands down a decision at least a week prior to the deadline.

The future president of GE, Jeffrey Immelt, said in Paris on Tuesday that the commission was opposed to the proposed takeover by GE of Honeywell for 45 billion dollars (52 billion euros), which he said stood virtually no chance of approval in its current form.

Immelt, who is to succeed Jack Welch, told the newspaper Le Monde in an interview that the chances of the deal going ahead were "zero".

He said that "the offer is on the table," adding "but all the signs we have received from the EU Commission lead us to think that this offer will not be accepted."
The two groups have big industrial and electronics interests notably in the aero sectors.

The July 3 commission meeting is to be preceded by a closed-door meeting in Brussels, probably next Monday, of the consultative committee grouping competition representatives of the 15 EU member states, who will have already received copies of the commission's draft report on the merger.

The European Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times of Londan have reported the commission will recommend blocking it in its current form.

Last Thursday GE offered concessions to meet EU competition objections but said these were unlikely to satisfy the EU authorities.
European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti reacted angrily on Monday to remarks suggesting that the EU
had already decided to reject the plan, and he condemned political pressure.

On Friday US President George Bush had said in Warsaw that his team had made contacts in Brussels over the deal and had the impression that the commission had already taken a decision to reject the takeover.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Europe to GE: Go Home

An epic quality has come to  GE's battle to get the Honeywell  acquisition approved  by European regulators, which after the latest meeting between Jack Welch and European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti seems all but kaput. The drama highlights the need to bring order to antitrust enforcement before it gets out of hand and undermines the global marketplace.

By nature, Europeans  seem disinclined to view the property rights of companies as any kind of inhibition against regulators doing whatever they please. In the  Honeywell  case, novel antitrust theories have been dreamed up simply because it would be unthinkable to let a large U.S. company go about its business unmolested. What might have given enforcers pause in any responsible jurisdiction is that opposition to the  GE-Honeywell merger comes almost entirely from  GE's competitors.

It would be hard to exaggerate the ludicrousness of this. When a firm's rivals complain about a deal being "anticompetitive," obviously they mean the opposite, that it would produce benefits for customers that they'd have to respond to. But the intellectual quality of the commission's deliberations was evident in the 1997
Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger, when Boeing was kneecapped into dropping exclusive contracts with two U.S. airlines. These deals were voluntary transactions on American soil, but giving them up was the price Airbus demanded for nodding the merger through.

Commissioner Monti's official challenge to the Honeywell buyout reportedly lifts passages from a brief by Rolls Royce, GE's rival in aircraft engines. What fills the competition with dread is the possibility that GE might package engines and Honeywell avionics under terms buyers would find attractive. Quelle horreur. This is called standardization, a hallmark of efficiency and industrial progress for 200 years. But we guess the idea is to block innovation because it might discomfit a competitor who prefers an unchanging world, requiring no effort to adapt. This is typical of monopolists and cartels, but seems to be the EC's ideal of "competition."

Mr. Monti's office also tried to rework GE's relationship with its aircraft-leasing arm, which commands a mere 10% of the relevant market. Gecas's business is not directly implicated in the merger, but the commission apparently saw an opportunity to take a customer away from GE engines and redistribute its business to GE's rivals.

This is foolish and, in some sense, corrupt, at least if the Commission pretends to base its positions on economic analysis. U.S. antitrust at times has also been an interest group pinata, but its silly actions are dissected by courts and lawyers, with the result that sophisticated, skeptical analysis has advanced.

The European Commission seems beyond reason at this point, with nothing to fear from judicial review and having picked a popular punching bag in GE, icon of what many continentals affect to find disturbing about "Anglo-American" capitalism. But attentive European pols and business leaders should at least be open to self-interest.

The nearest parallels to the way the Commission deliberates about antitrust are the occasional jags of the U.S. Congress, such as the one that nearly sank Deutsche Telekom's recent acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless. Alcatel lately was sniffing around Lucent. Germany's Bertelsmann, France's Vivendi and other European firms with global aspirations consider freedom to make acquisitions in the U.S. market, protected by our laws, essential to their hopes. They should be letting Mr. Monti know he's playing with fire.

We should also note that Mr. Monti's office has become a regular stopping place for U.S. firms seeking help to stymie their competitors. Microsoft's enemies are as busy in Brussels as they are in Washington. And Pratt & Whitney, outbid by GE for Honeywell, now works the hallways of the Brussels bazaar to thwart its rival.

Maybe it's time to revisit the basic outlines of public choice, the analytic framework that won James Buchanan the Nobel Prize. By funding these kinds of efforts, firms only increase the incentive for regulators to meddle by increasing the rewards of meddling. And where does it end?

Seventy years ago, trade warfare plunged the world into a depression and global conflagration. Nowadays, trade is still important, but the vast preponderance of international economic activity is actually the investment and marketing efforts of thousands of multinational firms -- U.S., Canadian, European, Japanese, soon to be joined by a growing horde of global companies based in what we used to think of as "developing" countries.

Nothing would roll up today's healthy, peaceful progress of the world economy faster than tit-for-tat corporate sabotage masquerading as antitrust enforcement. This is the risk Europe runs with its prolonged torture and apparent killing of the GE-Honeywell deal.

Honeywell-GE Deal Nears End of EU Review --- Firms Remain Committed to Merger, but European           
Approval Seems Unlikely
An Asian Wall Street Journal Roundup

A top European Union competition official said market testing on  General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion acquisition of Honeywell  International Inc. was expected to be finished this week.

"We will see in the next days what is the reaction of the market operators. I would not speculate under the present circumstances about the outcome of the test," said Alexander Schaub, the EuropeanCommission's director general for competition.

Under market testing, regulators seek comment from customers and competitors on concessions offered by companies seeking merger clearance.

Meanwhile, Honeywell on Monday reaffirmed its commitment to its proposed merger with GE despite skepticism toward the deal's prospects from both GE and from European regulatory officials reviewing it.

Honeywell directors met Monday in New York to look at their own options, as the merger agreement with GE, which came about last October after Honeywell spurned United Technologies Corp. at the last minute, appeared close to collapse. After weeks of haggling with antitrust regulators from the European Commission, GE submitted a final offer late last week, but said it was far short of what regulators wanted and unlikely to be accepted.

In a short statement Monday, Honeywell said it "expects that GE will do everything possible to secure regulatory approval for the transaction." The statement reflected a slight degree of tension brewing between GE and Honeywell, where some board members apparently want GE to fight harder for the deal, according to people close to the companies. Indeed, some directors at the board meeting groused that GE seems unwilling to do that
at this stage, even as some U.S. business executives and politicians -- including President George W. Bush -- are ratcheting up the pressure on the EU by expressing concern about the commission's approach to the transaction, people familiar with the situation said.

Honeywell believes "there is some chance, some small chance, that there will be some sort of accord," said one person close to the Honeywell side. Honeywell sees "some movement there, as more and more people speak up," he said. "Whatever it takes, (Honeywell is) telling GE that they ought to do it."

In response, a GE spokesman said the company is "fully committed to the final proposal that we submitted on June 14." In that proposal, GE offered to sell Honeywell businesses with $2.2 billion in annual revenue, as well as place management restrictions in its GE Capital Aviation Services unit, but said it would go no further.

Since that proposal was submitted Thursday, GE said, the company hasn't done any lobbying for its offer with the European Commission or other EU officials. Over the weekend, GE President and Chairman-Elect Jeffrey R. Immelt said at a news conference that the two sides are so far apart that political pressure would seem fruitless anyway.

The GE spokesman, Gary Sheffer, did say Monday that GE officials in EU countries would be meeting with member-state competition authorities to keep them informed of the process as GE's proposal makes its way through the final stage of regulatory review, with a decision due by July 12. But he reiterated that GE isn't seeking to build political pressure on the EU.

Newscast:  American  political figures  threaten retaliation against the EU if GE-Honeywell  deal is blocked

CNBC: Business Center

SUE HERERA, co-anchor: The sounds of saber rattling could be heard in Washington today, with some influential political figures defending GE's right to merge with  Honeywell.  There were clear threats of retaliation if the European Commission rejects those merger terms. Mike Huckman has the story.
MIKE HUCKMAN reporting:

European competition commissioner, Mario Monti, has made it clear in no uncertain terms that he does not welcome American political pressure to approve the GE-Honeywell deal. But that isn't stopping Washington from turning up the heat. In a pointed letter, interestingly addressed to the vice president of the commission and not Monti, Senate Aviation Sub-Committee Chair John Rockefeller writes, `The European Commission member states must know their decision could have a potentially chilling effect on transatlantic aerospace and aviation cooperation.' If the EU does not OK the deal, Rockefeller threatens his subcommittee may retaliate when a
European company wants to do a deal in the States. `The subcommittee will need to re-examine the open market the US has maintained for those sorts of acquisitions.'
Mr. DAN GRISWOLD (Associate Director, Cato Institute): I think Senator Rockefeller is right to be angry at the
European Union. I think the...

HUCKMAN: But Dan Griswold, an associate director of the Cato Institute in Washington, DC, a free-trade policy think tank, thinks threatening a tit-for-tat is not a good tactic.

Mr. GRISWOLD: It backs the Europeans into a corner in that if they change their policy now, it looks like we've browbeat them into it.
HUCKMAN: And Senator Rockefeller isn't the only one on Capitol Hill making noise.
Senator PHIL GRAMM (Republican, Texas): By traditional definitions, these are both American companies. HUCKMAN: During a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Texas Senator Phil Gramm repeated his beef with
European regulators and asked Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to put in his two cents.

Mr. ALAN GREENSPAN (Federal Reserve Chairman): I do think that the issue you are raising is an important one and one which must be resolved if we are going to continue to get the benefits of globalization which, in my judgment, are many.

HUCKMAN: The Swedish trade minister suggests a trade summit to talk about adopting global merger rules. Griswold says they wouldn't work.

Mr. GRISWOLD: I think the best thing we can do is--is maintain our--our open and more efficient market here and hope the Europeans come around to their senses.

HUCKMAN: Now next Monday, there is a meeting of the EU's advisory committee, which will then make a recommendation to Mario Monti, a recommendation, by the way that is not binding. In the meantime, a GE spokesman confirms today that the company is still talking to representatives of EU member states, but he denies a report that GE is trying to reopen the negotiations, saying it has made its best and its final offer. Sue, back to you.

HERERA: You know, Mike, the European Commission does have until that July 12th deadline to rule on the merger, but there are still a lot of rumors out there that they've already made up th--their minds.

HUCKMAN: Yeah. There are stories that the commission has been circulating some kind of draft report to its member states, urging them to reject the merger. But a spokesperson for the commission today denied that

Page 63 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
report. She says that the commission is still in the process of negotiating and that absolutely no decision has been made as of yet.
HERERA: Thanks very much, Mike.
Well, let's see how the stocks of the Dow components involved in this increasing political situation finished. (Graphic on screen)

Report on Business: The Wall Street Journal
EU plans to block GE Draft decision rejects Honeywell merger

BRUSSELS -- European antitrust enforcers have recommended formally blocking  General Electric  Co.'s bid to acquire Honeywell  International Inc., moving closer to officially ending the companies' embattled quest for regulatory approval,  people familiar with the situation told The Wall Street Journal.

In a draft decision prepared earlier this week, the  European Commission's Merger Task Force deemed  GE's latest proposals to win  antitrust approval  as insufficient and confirmed that the company's proposed $41-billion (U.S.) acquisition will not be allowed to go through in its current form. If the two sides are unable to bridge their differences, the Merger Task Force's draft decision would proceed to the  European Commission's College of Commissioners for final  approval.

The draft decision means that the number of scenarios under which the deal could still survive is rapidly diminishing. It also signals that the Commission is unlikely to suddenly change its mind about a deal that it fears could create an aerospace juggernaut capable of undercutting competition in the industry.

Last Thursday, European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti asked GE officials and lawyers in a phone conversation to withdraw the application for antitrust approval so that the EU wouldn't have to reject it, according to several people familiar with the situation. GE was open to that, but deferred to Honeywell, these people said.

Honeywell's general counsel Peter Krindlin, who is being advised by attorney James Venit of Skadden Arps in Brussels, told GE that Honeywell opposed pulling the deal, because it believed it might still pressure Mr. Monti to soften his stance, these people said. GE went along. Under the terms of the merger agreement, should GE unilaterally terminate the agreement, Honeywell could sue to enforce the merger pact.

A GE spokeswoman said yesterday there was no tension between GE and Honeywell as the two companies forge ahead with the merger process, even though people close to Honeywell have said some executives and board members are disgruntled that GE isn't pushing harder for approval.
"We're on the same page," said the GE spokeswoman, Louise Binns. "The final undertakings were submitted by
GE and Honeywell. We remain fully committed to the final proposal we have submitted."

A Honeywell spokesman, Tom Crane, said: "We're still committed to the merger and we expect GE to continue working with the EU over the next three weeks to complete the transaction."

GE and Honeywell could still come back to the negotiating table and offer more divestitures of businesses to the European antitrust enforcers. If those offers were clear-cut enough and satisfied all competition concerns, the Commission could accept them and reconsider its determination to kill the merger, which has already been approved by the U.S. Department of Justice.

But GE's top executives have said repeatedly that it is through negotiating and they are not going to raise the company's offer, officially submitted to the Commission last Thursday.

The apparent divergence of opinion between U.S. authorities, which have already approved the deal, and their more demanding European counterparts has triggered a litany of statements from U.S. government officials and business executives accusing the Commission of unfair interference with American business. Faced with this

GE-Honeywell  Edges Closer To EU Rejection

BRUSSELS -- European antitrust enforcers have recommended formally blocking  General Electric  Co.'s bid to acquire Honeywell  International Inc., moving closer to officially ending the companies' embattled quest for regulatory approval,  people familiar with the situation said.

In a draft decision prepared earlier this week, the EuropeanCommission's Merger Task Force deemed insufficient  GE's latest proposals to win antitrust approval  and confirmed that the proposed $41 billion acquisition won't be allowed to go through in its current form. If the two sides are unable to bridge their differences, the Merger Task Force's draft decision would proceed to the  European Commission's College of Commissioners for final  approval.

The draft decision means that the number of scenarios under which the deal could still survive is diminishing. The draft also signals the commission is unlikely to change its mind about a deal that it fears could create an aerospace juggernaut capable of undercutting competition.

Last Thursday, European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti asked GE officials and lawyers in a phone conversation to withdraw the application for antitrust approval so the EU wouldn't have to reject it, according to several people familiar with the situation. GE was open to that, but deferred to Honeywell, these people said.

Honeywell General Counsel Peter M. Kreindler, who is being advised by attorney James Venit of Skadden,Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Brussels, told GE that Honeywell opposed pulling the deal, because it believed it still might pressure Mr. Monti to soften his stance, these people said. GE went along.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, GE and Honeywell could mutually agree to terminate the pact with no penalty. Should GE unilaterally terminate the agreement, Honeywell could sue to enforce the merger pact.

Yesterday a GE spokeswoman said there is no tension between GE and Honeywell as the companies forge ahead with the merger process, even though people close to Honeywell have said some executives and board members are disgruntled that GE isn't pushing harder for approval.
"We're on the same page," said the GE spokeswoman, Louise Binns. "The final undertakings were submitted by
GE and Honeywell. We remain fully commited to the final proposal we have submitted."

She said GE "will be continuing to communicate with [European Union] member states to outline the merits of our proposal and the reasons we believe our final offer is sufficient."

A Honeywell spokesman, Tom Crane, said, "We're still committed to the merger and we expect GE to continue working with the EU over the next three weeks to complete the transaction."

GE and Honeywell still could come back to the European antitrust enforcers and offer to sell more businesses. If the offers were clear cut enough and satisfied all competition concerns, the commission could accept them and reconsider its determination to kill the merger, which already has been approved by the U.S. Justice Department.

But GE's top executives have said repeatedly that the company is through negotiating, and they aren't going to raise the offer officially submitted to the commission last Thursday.

In that proposal, GE offered to sell several Honeywell units with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion and offered to introduce separate management for GE Capital Aviation Services, known as Gecas, the company's powerful
Page 67 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
aircraft financing and leasing arm. The commission charges that Gecas promotes GE's equipment to the
detriment of competitors. Commission officials continue to seek a remedy that would render such promotion more
difficult.

But the commission said GE's offer wasn't enough and asked the company either to sell more of Honeywell's core businesses or to come up with a more far-reaching remedy to separate Gecas. GE balked at demands for more sales and rejected any measures that would leave it with less than 100% ownership of Gecas.

GE's negotiators argue that the commission's analysis of the deal has been based on shaky economic theories. Those theories have led the regulators to conclude -- erroneously, GE says -- that the combined company would be able to push weaker rivals out of the market. Despite the draft decision, the EU still could soften its demands in the interest of getting a deal done.

Earlier this week, the commission circulated some of GE's proposed antitrust remedies to rivals of GE and Honeywell to get feedback on the proposals' validity. However, that consultation doesn't constitute an official market test, which the commission typically would do to confirm with competitors that certain antitrust remedies would be sufficient.
"It's more of a procedural step," one person familiar with the situation said about the consultation.

In fact, in the industry consultation the commission isn't even mentioning Gecas as one of the antitrust remedies, because it already has decided that GE's proposal to "ring-fence" the management and administrative functions of the leasing unit doesn't go far enough.

Instead, industry feedback is being sought on the commercial viability of several Honeywell units that GE has offered to sell. The commission still thinks these units have little chance of surviving on their own because they would be "carved out" from a larger chunk of Honeywell business.

European regulators have reportedly recommended that the $41 billion  merger between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. be blocked.

The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site Tuesday that the European Commission's Merger Task Force said GE's efforts to win antitrust approval  were "insufficient." The European Commission is the executive arm of the 15-nation European Union.

Citing unnamed people familiar with the deal, the newspaper said the task force will forward its draft decision to the EC's College of Commissioners for final approval unless the companies can come up with a different merger plan.

The EU must decide by July 12 whether or not to approve the deal. It has expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.

GE President Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published earlier Tuesday that there was "zero" chance his company's $41 billion merger with U.S. technology firm Honeywell International Inc. would go ahead.

"The indications we have from the European Commission lead us to think the offer won't be accepted," Immelt told the French daily Le Monde. The deal has so far failed to win clearance from European regulators.

"The percentage is zero," he said when asked to estimate the chances of a successful conclusion to the proposed acquisition, which would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Honeywell shares were down $1.50 a share, or 3.8 percent, to $38.50, while GE shares fell 13 cents to close at $48.87.

Immelt is due to take over as chairman of General Electric when Jack Welch, who delayed his retirement to see through the Honeywell deal, steps down later this year.

Although the deal won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU regulators, who are reportedly demanding that GE sell off billions worth of assets. GE has said the EU rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient.
In the Le Monde interview, Immelt rejected suggestions that GE's hints that it is preparing for life without
Honeywell were a political maneuver, designed to increase pressure on European authorities.

"General Electric doesn't want to transform this competition issue into a U.S.-Europe problem," Immelt said. "This matter is based on economic facts. We don't agree with the commission but we don't intend to run crying to politicians.

"We haven't withdrawn the offer because we haven't reached agreement with Honeywell and we don't want to do it unilaterally," he added.
On Monday, Honeywell's board of directors reaffirmed its full commitment to the deal. Document rec0000020010713dx6k00jrc

General Electric  Co. president Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published Tuesday there was "zero" chance his company's $41 billion  merger with U.S. technology firm  Honeywell  International Inc. would go ahead.

"The indications we have from the  European Commission lead us to think the offer won't be accepted," Immelt told the French daily Le Monde, referring to the executive arm of the 15-nation  European Union. The deal has so far failed to win clearance from  European regulators.

In the Le Monde interview, Immelt rejected suggestions that GE was trying to bring U.S. political pressure to bear against European authorities.

"General Electric doesn't want to transform this competition issue into a U.S.-Europe problem," Immelt said. "This matter is based on economic facts. We don't agree with the commission, but we don't intend to run crying to politicians."

"We haven't withdrawn the offer because we haven't reached agreement with Honeywell and we don't want to do it unilaterally," he added. On Monday, Honeywell's board of directors reaffirmed its full commitment to the deal.

Immelt, who was in Paris this weekend to visit the Paris Air Show, told Le Monde that GE's position "is so far removed from the European Commission's that we don't think it's wise to make a political matter out of it."

The EU must decide by July 12 whether to approve the deal. It has expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.

On Monday, the EU's top antitrust regulator said the Europeans were not the only ones with reservations about the merger.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the proposed deal had raised strong concerns among airlines and aircraft equipment makers on both sides of the Atlantic.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said Monday in Washington he was disappointed by the EU's opposition.
"Obviously we're disappointed," Zoellick said. "If it ends up this way, it's an unfortunate result." Document TUL0000020151213dx6k01zxx

Merger-Busting in Europe

Jeffrey Immelt, president and chairman-elect of  General Electric,  says his company's chances of merging with Honeywell,  another electronics and aircraft technology giant, have virtually evaporated. Though the interested parties are two American companies, and American  regulators have approved  the deal, the European Commission is blocking the union because of its perceived potential for dampening competition in global markets. If G.E. and  Honeywell  were to go ahead without the  commission's approval,  fines or bars to selling could result. We support the right of foreign governments, especially those of developing countries, to  regulate American businesses that take dominant market positions in their jurisdictions. But the  Europeans  have not explained their position except to say that airlines, which have kept mum through the deal's review, share their concerns.
Moreover, a collapse in this case will cast a dark shadow over corporate activity in the future.

The European Commission's first concern is that G.E. would acquire a popular supplier of components to other engine makers, opening the door to destructive gouging of competitors. The merged company might also bundle Honeywell avionics technology with G.E. engines. This practice could force buyers of G.E. engines to accept Honeywell avionics, or at least lead to low, ''package deal'' rates that might force companies selling only avionics or engines out of the market. Though G.E. expected to make some concessions to assuage these fears, it did not guess that this merger would provoke a formidable legal threat in one of its biggest markets.

The source of this surprise is the European Union's competition policy, which is full of contradictory goals. Its vague language on encouraging innovation while protecting consumers and ''national champion'' businesses makes it hard for companies contemplating mergers to anticipate where the E.C. will see threats to free markets. The policy also prescribes few specific ways of judging anti-competitive pressures. As a result the E.C. has usually taken a flexible approach to decision-making, consisting of several rounds of analysis and back-and-forth negotiating with the parties involved.

G.E., whose team has been leading the negotiations, had prepared itself for this process. It offered concessions such as selling off portions of Honeywell's aerospace business worth $2.2 billion in revenues annually, and turning its own aircraft-leasing arm into an independently managed but G.E.-owned company. But the commission's last counteroffer asked for almost total divestiture of Honeywell's avionics business and
scaled-down ownership of the leasing arm. The E.C.'s demands would supposedly protect airlines and aircraft makers, which would suffer the most if a single company dominated the aircraft engine and avionics markets. Yet airlines have not corroborated the E.C.'s concerns in public, and two leading aircraft makers, Boeing and Airbus, both support the merger.

If, when they meet next Monday, the E.C.'s regulators confirm their preliminary ruling against the deal, American companies will take it as a high-profile signal to change their behavior. Corporate boards will be more likely to
think twice before undertaking mergers that affect Europe's markets. American companies will also shy away from big investments in Europe if, down the road, its regulators might torpedo mergers that would create value in the United States and elsewhere. That would give the E.C.'s actions a perverse result: discouraging American
players, and actually harming competition in European markets.

On this side of the Atlantic, Congress and the White House must be careful not to overreact. President Bush's antitrust team is more sympathetic to big mergers than Bill Clinton's was, so the commission's action strikes a stronger contrast than it might have only a year ago. But taking legislative action to retaliate against European companies in the United States, as Senator Jay Rockefeller suggested his subcommittee on aviation might, would go too far. A disagreement on the fate of one merger should not disrupt what has, in the past, been more of a

cooperative relationship on regulation. If the commission has acted in a way that restrains trade without helping competition, then declining foreign investment and higher prices for aircraft technology will be punishment enough.

Jitters  About PepsiCo-Quaker Deal After GE-Honeywell
By Janet Whitman

New York -(Dow Jones)- It's a case of once bitten, twice shy.

After getting burnt on  General Electric's  (GE) apparently failed battle to win European regulatory approval  to purchase Honeywell  International (HON), takeover traders are lightening up their bets on the planned merger between PepsiCo. Inc. (PEP) and Quaker Oats Co. (OAT), amid fears that U.S.  regulators may block that deal.

There have been rumblings that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission may oppose the $14 billion Pepsi-Quaker merger, but the deal's ballooning spread over the past couple of days has more to do with market jitters following last week's GE-Honeywell blowup, rather than significant concerns about the deal's chances of closing, market observers say.

"Usually after large deal breaks you see panic," said one arbitrageur. "Fingers got burned and that's causing the spread to be wider."
The deal's spread - the gap between Quaker's stock price and its takeout price - widened to more than $15
Thursday.
That means Quaker is trading at a whopping 17% discount to PepsiCo's offer.
That indicates that investors now believe that the deal, which is pending approval by the FTC, has a less than
50% chance of succeeding, said Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight. "We think the odds are much higher
than the market does. The deal will eventually get done. We think the selling is overdone."

Without the GE-Honeywell debacle, the PepsiCo-Quaker spread would likely be trading at about $8 or $10, rather than its current spread of $15, said an arbitrageur.

Takeover traders may have lost as much as $1 billion over the past couple of weeks on the GE-Honeywell deal, after GE and European regulators sent signals that the merger would probably not pass regulatory muster.

Now, with jitters about the Pepsi-Quaker deal escalating, traders have begun to unwind some of their bets that the deal will close by selling their Quaker shares and covering their short PepsiCo positions. (Takeover traders typically bet on a deal by buying the stock of the target, in this case Quaker, and shorting, or selling, the acquirer's stock, in this case Pepsi.)

Quaker slipped 2.1%, or $1.94, to $89.05 a share on Thursday on volume of 2.4 million shares, compared to average daily volume of 935,183. PepsiCo's stock changed hands recently at $45.24, up 2.7%, or $1.18, on volume of 5.7 million shares, up from average daily volume of 3.9 million.

"We've been recommending scale purchases here," said Burnett of Merger Insight, a research firm that advises institutional clients. "We're not saying go hog wild, but we would be buyers (of Quaker) at $88."

A.G. Edwards - which upgraded Quaker Thursday on the belief that the merger will go through without any change to the economics of the transaction - also isn't buying speculation that the FTC will squash the deal.

"The rumor at present is that the FTC will issue a preliminary injunction against the deal since it does not believe that Monarch Beverages, the proposed purchaser of PepsiCo's All Sport brand which is at the heart of the struggle here, is a legitimate competitor in the beverage market," said Chris Growe, an analyst at the firm. "We
Page 74 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
believe PepsiCo would be willing to "give" this brand away to some larger company just to make sure this deal gets completed."

Rumors also are swirling that some FTC personal are opposed to either Coca-Cola Co. (KO) or Pepsi, the two heavyweights in the soft drinks industry, owning Gatorade, the market-dominating sports drink owned by Quaker.

Should PepsiCo's bid prove unsuccessful, A.G. Edwards pegs the downside for Quaker at between $75 and $85 a share, based mostly on the likelihood that another bidder could emerge.

Holders To Honeywell: Get Ready To Be Independent-For Now
By Christopher C. Williams
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Get ready to go it alone - at least for a while.

That's the message some big institutional shareholders have for Honeywell  International Inc. (HON), amid growing signs the company's acquisition by General Electric  (GE) might fall through. GE has said the deal has "zero" chance of passing muster with European antitrustregulators, and a European task force has reportedly recommended formally blocking the merger. Honeywell,  however, has said it still expects  GE to fight for approval.

Smarting from slowing economy, management defections and sinking stock price, Honeywell probably isn't relishing the prospects of becoming an independent company, but the company may have little choice, say major shareholders. Many give the GE-Honeywell deal less than 10% chance of getting done.

But few company observers expect Honeywell to remain independent for long, with United Technologies Inc. (UTX) a likely suitor.

"They must hope for the best and make plans for going it alone," said Tom Mahowald, a senior securities analyst with American Express Financial Advisor.

"Honeywell must continue to look for a buyer," said Tom Leritz, senior capital goods analyst with Banc of America Capital Management. "If not, then they probably need to divest some slower growing businesses," such as the chemical business.
"If all falls through, the board should hire a respectable management team," Leritz said.

However, "the best avenue for them is to sell out," he added. "The company is hurting, but their aviation business is a gem."

United Technologies and Tyco International Inc. (TYC) have been the most widely rumored suitors-in-waiting for Honeywell. United Technologies, whose offer to buy Honeywell last October was spurned, has declined to comment on the speculation and Tyco has said it isn't interested.

A likely scenario, said Leritz, is that GE backs away, United Technologies bides its time over the next couple of quarters and "finally snaps them up."

If the GE-Honeywell deal falls through and Honeywell does go on the market again, it probably won't find a lot of buyers, decreasing the likelihood of fetching a high price.

"Honeywell is in a buyer's market," said Leritz, of Banc of America, a Honeywell and GE shareholder. Leritz added that there's probably only two or three companies in the world in a position to pull off a deal for such a large company as Honeywell.
Without much competition, United Technologies could buy Honeywell for the high-$30s or low-$40's, said Leritz. While the shareholders interviewed by Dow Jones Newswires suggest GE and Honeywell appear to be doing
everything reasonable to get the deal approved, Guy P. Wyser-Pratte, known as a speculator in takeover stocks,
is more critical.

Page 76 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In an open letter to Honeywell and GE, Wyser-Pratte, of Wyser-Pratte Inc., a Honeywell shareholder, said GE is "running out the clock" on a merger it seems to believe is dead. Wyser-Pratte calls upon Honeywell's management to pursue the issue of whether GE is living up to its obligations under the merger agreement.

GE declined to comment on Wyser-Pratte's statement. GE spokeswoman Louise Binns repeated GE's line that it remains "fully committed to the offer GE and Honeywell made last Thursday." Binns also maintained that GE won't act unilaterally of Honeywell.

Last Thursday, GE offered to divest operations that would bring in $2.2 billion of revenue and to establish a separate management structure for GE's aircraft leasing and financing arm. But those concessions fell well short of the EU's demands, which call for billions more in divestitures, which could include GE Capital Aviation Services, known as GECAS.

Many institutional shareholders seem to support GE's balking at selling its financing and leasing business. "They aren't going to restructure GE to make the deal work," said portfolio manager Timothy Ghriskey, of Dreyfus Funds, a shareholder of GE and Honeywell.
In the meantime, Honeywell shares continue to lose steam amid the growing pessimism over the deal, while GE
stock continues to gain ground, reflecting the widely held view that GE will do fine with or without Honeywell.

NYSE-listed Honeywell fell 29 cents to $36.75 on 14 million shares, and GE was up 48 cents to $51.25 on 31 million shares.
Salomon Smith Barney cut its rating on Honeywell to neutral from buy and lowered its 2001 earnings estimate to
$2.50 a share from $2.85, citing, among other things, "possible internal disruptions caused by the deal's apparent
collapse."

Analyst Jeffrey Sprague said the stock is properly priced in the high $30s but could trade into the low $30s if the company goes it alone. "Alternatively, it could be worth perhaps mid-$40s in a UTX merger or trade near that in a year or so if the company successfully regroups and regains investor confidence," said the analyst in research note.

US threat to Euro firms'  merger plans

THE spat between the European Union and the United States over the proposed pounds 30 billion  General        Electric/Honeywell merger threatens future transatlantic takeovers, US officials have warned.

In a letter to  European Commission vice-president Loyola de Palacio, Senator John Rockefeller, the US Senate's aviation subcommittee chairman, said if the EC was "unfairly blocking" mergers between US and European companies mainly to protect the position of European rivals, then the US would need to "re-examine" the open market the US has maintained for takeovers.
In the toughest stance yet from the US on the deal, Mr Rockefeller said he wants to explore "an effective US
response".
"This may be the front edge of some more disputes between us and the EU," said Robert Litan, a former Justice
Department official now with the Brookings Institution. Analysts have said the rift could be more serious than the
1997 clash over aerospace giant Boeing's acquisition of rival US planemaker McDonnell Douglas.

When the EU threatened to turn down the Boeing merger, the US promised a trade war averted when European n officials finally relented.

"The GE-Honeywill deal has cost investors in this country billions and billions of dollars. A lot of people were adversely affected," said Steve Axinn, an antitrust lawyer.

And he added: "You can expect that there will be recriminations. The tinder is dry and it takes just one political match and you will have a fire."

Honeywell and General Electric are among the elite of firms listed on the world's most-watched stock market index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. But while General Electric, the world's largest jet engine maker, and owner of brands such as Hotpoint, has continued to prosper despite the time taken to win takeover approval, Honeywell has found the delays harder to cope with.

Honeywell, manufacturer of products from security systems to aircraft electrics, in April revealed profits down 91 per cent, and said it would cut 6500 jobs.

The EU is due to make a decision by July 12 on whether to approve the GE-Honeywell combination, which has been approved by US and Canadian antitrust regulators.

In an effort to win approval, GE offered to sell assets generating GBP 1.6bn in annual revenues and limit operations of its General Electric Capital Aviation Services (Gecas), which buys, sells and leases airliners. But the EC said the measures did not go far enough.
Yesterday, reports emerged that EC staff had already recommended rejecting the merger.
The dispute became more evident last night with the angry response from Senator Rockefeller.

He said blocking the deal would have a "chilling effect on future transatlantic aviation and aerospace co-operation".

The GE-Honeywell deal is inflaming US passions even though it was US regulators who last year blocked an all-European takeover that had EU clearance - Air Liquide's purchase of chemicals BOC Group.
"This is something that is not going to go away," said one source in Congress.
Page 78 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Even Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal reserve has joined the debate, warning that antitrust differences "must be resolved if we are going to continue to get the benefits of globalisation."

One UK analyst said t George Bush's administration was "not on the same wavelength as Europe" over competition.

Senator: EC wrong to nix GEmerger

A senior Democratic senator yesterday warned that the U.S. government might retaliate if the  European              CommissionrejectsGeneral Electric  Co.'s bid to buy  Honeywell  International Inc.

In a letter to  EC Vice President Loyola de Palacio, Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia said U.S. officials will "explore what might be the most effective U.S. response if the fairness and openness we have historically extended to the  European aerospace firms is not being reciprocated."

Mr. Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation's subcommittee on aviation, said that if the EC rejects the GE-Honeywell deal, it would have a "chilling effect on future trans-Atlantic aviation and aerospace cooperation."

"There is growing frustration in the United States that European aerospace companies continue to obtain regulatory protection and subsidies from the European Commission, but are seeking increased opportunities to acquire U.S. companies, gain access to sensitive U.S. technologies and participate in U.S. national-security programs," Mr. Rockefeller wrote.

"If it appears that the European Commission is unfairly blocking mergers between U.S. companies principally to protect the position of European competitors, then the subcommittee will need to re-examine the open market the U.S. has maintained for those sorts of acquisitions," the letter says.

Mr. Rockefeller's letter is the most strongly worded critique to come out of Congress since the GE-Honeywell deal ran into trouble in Brussels last week.
The EU is due to make a decision by July 12 on whether to allow the deal - which has been approved by U.S. and
Canadian antitrust regulators - to go ahead.

In an effort to win approval, GE offered to sell assets generating $2.2 billion in annual revenues and limit operations of its General Electric Capital Aviation Services, which buys, sells and leases airliners.

However, those concessions fell short of the EC's demands. And sources said yesterday that the commission's staff had recommended rejecting the merger.
In his letter, Mr. Rockefeller said the EC's review of the $42 billion deal "will raise serious concerns among
Americans about whether this review has been conducted with fairness and neutrality."
Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas said during a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee hearing that he also was "troubled" by the EC's stance on the merger.

"My concern is that we don't end up having bad policies imposed on us as Europeans try to protect themselves when they've lost competitive edge," Mr. Gramm said.
"I think this is something we're going to have to look at very, very closely," he added. Document WATI000020140719dx6l0105z

US Officials Cautious  About EU's GE-Honeywell  Decision

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. trade officials Thursday said they are troubled by the E.U.'s apparent rejection of a merger between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International, but downplayed any harmful effects of the decision on transatlantic trade relations.
Calling the E.U.  Competition Ministry's demands for  GE and Honeywell  to divest of about $5.0 billion in
business assets as a condition of  merger "a very disturbing situation," U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans said
U.S. officials now must work to understand why U.S. and E.U. anti-trust authorities came to such differing
conclusions over the benefits of the deal. The U.S. Justice Department required divestitures of only about $200
million as a condition for  approval,  Evans said. Evans was responding to questions from New Jersey Senator
Robert Torricelli, a Democrat, while taking part in a panel on trade before the Senate Finance Committee.

Torricelli suggested that European companies seeking permission to merge from the U.S. Justice Department may find it more difficult to get U.S. approval in the wake of GE and Honeywell's experience.
Evans cautioned that the U.S. should keep in mind the importance of total trade between the U.S. and E.U. and
"be careful not to overreact."

Appearing with Evans, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick stressed conflict concerned competition laws, rather than trade policy.

"I believe the theologians there are relying on old concepts our economists have given up a long time ago, that is concerning the customer versus competition," Zoellick said.

While the deal is technically ongoing, executives from GE and Honeywell have said there is no chance the deal would be approved in Europe.

EU is blocking major US merger Unless either side relents in the next three weeks, the mega General      
Electric-Honeywell deal could be history.

If two American companies decide to merge, and US  antitrust regulators approve the deal, they go ahead and merge, right? Wrong.

In today's globalized world, European and other foreign  regulators can block an American deal if the parties do much business abroad. And the European Union appears ready to kill General Electric's  planned $42 billion takeover of  Honeywell  International, heralded as the biggest industrial merger in history.

If GE continues to reject European demands that the deal be changed, and the European Commission does not back down in the next three weeks, it will be the first time Brussels has scuppered a merger between US companies that Washington has approved.
That prospect has some US politicians worried.

"I think this is something that's troubling, something we need to look at," Sen. Phil Gramm told CNBC, the business news TV channel. "It's a very real question - what power the EU should have in dealing with two companies that are fundamentally American companies."

European officials say it is perfectly normal. "What matters is where the companies do business, not where they are located," says Amelia Torres, spokeswoman for the EU competition commissioner, Mario Monti. "If they do business in Europe, they have to abide by European rules."

Those rules sometimes reflect a transatlantic difference of approach. European investigators, for example, pay more heed than their American counterpoints to arguments by rival companies that they would suffer from their competitors' mergers.
Last year, GE generated about $25 billion of its $130 billion worldwide revenues in Europe, where it employs
85,000 people, according to Jeffrey Immelt, GE president.

Mr. Monti, a Yale educated Italian economics professor, has the final say over any deal if the merging parties have a combined global turnover of more than $4.25 billion and European sales of $225 million each.

That gives Monti and his 100- strong team of investigators considerable power over US firms - and that power is set to grow, says Bert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a Washington-based think tank.

"Companies have to conform their behavior to the strongest boss," he says. With the new US administration expected to take a less interventionist antitrust line, "if the US backs away and the European Commission steps forward, what it says will increasingly decide things."

American and European regulators generally agree about proposed mergers that come up for their review. European authorities almost always approve deals involving US firms, and some analysts say the GE-Honeywell affair is a one-off.
But the case has revealed disparate styles that some antitrust lawyers say could cause friction in the future.

The European Competition Task Force tends to give greater weight than US regulators to the opinion of third parties who would be hurt by a merger, antitrust experts say. Two of GE's competitors, Rockwell International and United Technologies, played a leading role in lobbying EU officials against the Honeywell takeover, according to people close to the negotiations.

"Because the timing is so tight, there is a limit to what investigation the commission can do on its own," says Nils von Hinten-Reed, an antitrust expert with London Economics, a consultancy firm. By law, the commission must rule on any merger application within five months. "Inevitably they put what one party says against what the other party says."

The EC's Ms. Torres defends the hearing that the commission gives to merging companies' rivals. "We are not working in a vacuum," she argues. "And we are well capable of distinguishing between genuine competition concerns and attempts to get a free ride" by complainants.

European and American antitrust regulators appear to be diverging over economic theory, too. The EC objects to aspects of the GE- Honeywell deal because it fears that GE could use its aircraft leasing arm -the largest purchaser of aircraft in the world -and its financial subsidiary to sway aircraft manufacturers to choose not just GE jet engines, but Honeywell avionics, too.

The US authorities saw no reason to fear such "bundling" of products. GE's CEO, Jack Welch, issued an angry statement last week, saying that "the European regulators' demands ... differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the US and Canada.
"This shows you are never too old to get surprised," he added.

Mr. Welch buttressed his public outburst with a private call to Andrew Card, President Bush's chief of staff, to generate some political heat. Mr. Bush said publicly during his European tour that he was "concerned that the Europeans have rejected" GE's plans.
Commerce Secretary Don Evans, in Paris, boosted the deal as "a very positive kind of step for free trade." Monti reacted sharply on Monday, saying he "deplore[d] attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political
intervention."

The dispute has raised fears of a new transatlantic trade war, such as was narrowly averted in 1997, when heavy political pressure from then-President Bill Clinton persuaded the EC and Boeing Corp. to compromise over the aircraft giant's merger with McDonnell Douglas, which Brussels was threatening to block.

Europe has influenced other US deals. Last year Monti refused to accept Worldcom's merger with Sprint -a deal that the US Justice Department also opposed -and the Europeans forced AOL to make concessions when it bought Time Warner for $165 billion.

The EC's influence, and apparently stricter stance, could appeal to American companies who don't want their rivals to merge, say antitrust lawyers. "To the extent that they see greater opportunities in Europe" to block deals by lobbying Brussels regulators, "they will make use of them," says Mr. Foer.
But this is a two way street, officials point out. Last year, for example, the European Commission approved the
French company Air Liquide's plan to take over the British firm BOC, but the deal was nixed by US regulators.
The commission has also killed European merger proposals, such as Volvo's bid to merge with truck-builder
Scania.
Most deals of all sorts go through, though. The Commission has reviewed some 1,700 merger applications since
1989 and prohibited only 14 of them, according to Ms. Torres. One of the deals it killed involved at least a US
company.

As they study planned mergers, European investigators work closely with their US counterparts, sharing files and staying in daily e- mail contact, according to officials on both sides. "We should not let this [GE-Honeywell] case overshadow the fact that we work extremely well together," says Torres. "Mr. Monti is optimistic that our cooperation will continue to be fruitful."

The GE case, however, "reflects a growing rift between the US and the EU on antitrust," suggests Foer. "There is no question that the Europeans are closer to where we were in the 1960's and 70's, more interventionist, than we are now.

20/06/2001 (Agence Europe) - In an interview given to Le Monde, Jeffrey Immelt, successor to the acting President of General Electric,  Jack Welsh, feels that the probability of a merger between GE and Honeywell  is "none existent". In Europe, the anti-trust authorities are very careful with competition, in the United States, they are more concerned with consumer interests (...). We are surprised with the (European) Commission's conclusions, but it is, in fact, coherent with itself, he asserts. Furthermore, sources close to the dossier indicate that the decision by the  Commission should logically arise on 3 July, as the  Commission usually issues its opinion in this form of dossier "the Wednesday before the final deadline". This date corresponds with 4 July, but the College of  Commissioners will gather that week on Tuesday 3 July in Strasbourg.

EU Antitrust Team Suggests  GE Rejection  --- But Honeywell  Keeps Pushing  Merger Ahead of
Commissioners' Final Vote

BRUSSELS -- European antitrust enforcers have recommended formally blocking  General Electric  Co.'s bid to acquire Honeywell  International Inc., moving closer to officially ending the companies' embattled quest for regulatory approval,  people familiar with the situation said.

In a draft decision prepared earlier this week, the EuropeanCommission's Merger Task Force deemed insufficient  GE's latest proposals to win antitrust approval  and confirmed that the proposed $41 billion acquisition won't be allowed to go through in its current form. If the two sides are unable to bridge their differences, the Merger Task Force's draft decision would proceed to the  European Commission's College of Commissioners for final  approval.

The draft decision means that the number of scenarios under which the deal could still survive is diminishing. The draft also signals the commission is unlikely to change its mind about a deal that it fears could create an aerospace juggernaut capable of undercutting competition.

Last Thursday, European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti asked GE officials and lawyers in a phone conversation to withdraw the application for antitrust approval so the EU wouldn't have to reject it, according to several people familiar with the situation. GE was open to that, but deferred to Honeywell, these people said.

Honeywell General Counsel Peter M. Kreindler, who is being advised by attorney James Venit of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Brussels, told GE that Honeywell opposed pulling the deal, because it believed it still might pressure Mr. Monti to soften his stance, these people said. GE went along.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, GE and Honeywell could mutually agree to terminate the pact with no penalty. Should GE unilaterally terminate the agreement, Honeywell could sue to enforce the merger pact.

On Tuesday a GE spokeswoman said there was no tension between GE and Honeywell as the companies forge ahead with the merger process, even though people close to Honeywell have said some executives and board members are disgruntled that GE isn't pushing harder for approval.
"We're on the same page," said the GE spokeswoman, Louise Binns. "The final undertakings were submitted by
GE and Honeywell. We remain fully committed to the final proposal we have submitted."

She said GE "will be continuing to communicate with [European Union] member states to outline the merits of our proposal and the reasons we believe our final offer is sufficient."

A Honeywell spokesman, Tom Crane, said, "We're still committed to the merger and we expect GE to continue working with the EU over the next three weeks to complete the transaction."

GE and Honeywell still could come back to the European antitrust enforcers and offer to sell more businesses. If the offers were clear cut enough and satisfied all competition concerns, the commission could accept them and reconsider its determination to kill the merger, which has already been approved by the U.S. Justice Department.

But GE's top executives have said repeatedly that the company is through negotiating, and they aren't going to raise the offer officially submitted to the commission last Thursday.

Jack Welch, the CEO of General Electronic, must re-write the end of his autobiography due to the recent failed
merger with Honeywell.

Welch was planning to end his autobiography, 'Straight From the Gut', with a chapter on the Honeywell  merger. According to  GE president Jeffrey Immelt, the USD41bn deal is now unlikely to go through due to European antitrust demands. Welch wants to end his book with something more suitable than a gallant last-ditch failure, reported USAToday.com.

The autobiography is due to be released on 11 September and Welch and his publisher, Warner Books, hope they will meet the deadline as they do not want to miss the wave of free publicity generated by Welch's retirement.

Commerce Secretary Don Evans put the Bush administration on record, calling on European officials to rethink their position.  GE's CEO-elect and president Jeffrey Immelt underscored the gap between the  merger terms acceptable in this country and unacceptable in  Europe.

Mr. JEFFREY IMMELT (General Electric  CEO-Elect): Where we were in the US, which was $200 million worth of disposals, we've offered, in Europe, $2.2 billion of--of disposals, which wasn't accepted by the commission, left us without a significant amount of hope. We're working through the process with the commission in a

If EU Axes the GE Deal, an Appeal Is Not Very Appealing --- Odds of Reversal Are Long, Effort and Cost
Great; A Senator Weighs In
By Brandon Mitchener
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

BRUSSELS -- The good news for merging companies that run afoul of  European antitrust authorities is that the regulators' decisions can be appealed. The bad news is that the appeals process takes years and the authorities usually win.

The trouble that General Electric  Co.'s $44 billion bid for  Honeywell  International Inc. has run into at the European Commission has rekindled accusations that, thanks to the peculiarities of the  European Union's legal process, the EU's executive arm winds up acting as judge, jury and executioner in major mergers and
acquisitions. In fact, of the six  merger applicants that have appealed  commission rulings in the past 10 years, none has yet won a reversal.

Advocates of the GE-Honeywell merger aren't waiting around for a possible appeal. President Bush has expressed concern about the commission's approach to evaluating the transaction, and yesterday Sen. John D. "Jay" Rockefeller IV, chairman of the subcommittee on aviation, sent a strongly worded letter to Loyola de Palacio, the commission's vice president, in which he said he was "deeply disturbed" by reports that the commission could block the deal.

Mr. Rockefeller said the history of the case as reported so far "will raise serious concerns among Americans about whether this review has been conducted with fairness and neutrality." He hinted that his subcommittee would re-examine merger standards for foreign aerospace companies doing U.S. business if it concluded that the European Commission was acting to protect European companies by blocking the GE-Honeywell merger.
Yesterday as of 4 p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of GE were up $1.90 at
$50.77, while Honeywell was down $1.46 at $37.04.

Even as Washington pressures the EU, Honeywell shareholders are pressuring Honeywell and GE to keep negotiating with the EU, suggesting that a failure to do so would violate the merger pact, which requires GE to make "reasonable best efforts" to negotiate with regulators.
In a letter to Honeywell's board, Guy P. Wyser-Pratte, president of Wyser-Pratte Inc., which owns roughly
500,000 Honeywell shares, said GE's "seeming strategy of submitting a proposal to the EU that GE believes is
DOA [dead on arrival], and then `running out the clock,' does not seem to us to comport with the legal landscape
contained within the merger agreement between Honeywell and GE."
Honeywell and GE declined to comment on Mr. Wyser-Pratte's letter.

If the commission does ax the deal, the prospects of an appeal don't favor the aspiring merger partners. Three of the six appeals filed in the past decade ended with Europe's Court of First Instance, in Luxembourg, siding with the commission, and one was withdrawn. The other two, including WorldCom Inc.'s petition to overturn the blocking of its acquisition of Sprint Corp., are pending.

Antitrust lawyers say that record doesn't necessarily mean the commission or courts are unfair -- just that the cards are stacked against the companies doing the appealing, and not only in Europe. "The way mergers and acquisitions work, it's extremely time-critical," says Ross Denton, a partner at Baker & MacKenzie in Brussels. "Time isn't on the side of the applicant."

Page 91 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And the applicants know it. Seven of the 13 whose deals the commission has quashed in the past decade didn't even bother to appeal; most preferred to move on rather than spend time in court and more money on lawyers. The situation is much the same in the U.S., legal experts say.

The European Commission, for its part, publicly welcomes court challenges. Enrique Gonzalez-Diaz, the commission's case handler on GE-Honeywell, encouraged lawyers listening to a panel discussion at a conference in March to appeal unfavorable decisions to the Court of First Instance, which has the power to suspend commission decisions.

As its name implies, the court handles the initial appeals of rulings from agencies in Brussels. Decisions can be appealed to one higher court, the European Court of Justice, though that court generally restricts its reviews to questions of procedure.

No company has ever asked the Court of First Instance to suspend a ruling preventing a deal so that it could actually proceed with the merger or acquisition. One reason, the experts say, is that many deals submitted to the commission for review are contingent on their approval; if the commission says no, the deal doesn't exist, so there's no deal to salvage by appealing.

The last company to go to Luxembourg was WorldCom, which wants to see the EU's decision nullified, not to do the Sprint deal but on principle -- "so that the decision does not become the basis for future commission actions or initiatives," WorldCom's chief counsel said in a written statement at the time. The commission's response was that its decision "is sound and that it will resist any legal challenge."

RESEAERCH ALERT-Salomon cuts Honeywell  rating, estimates.

NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - Salomon Brothers said Thursday it has downgraded Honeywell  Inc. and cut its earnings estimates because  European officials are unlikely to  approve a merger with General Electric.  Co.

Analyst Jeffrey Sprague downgraded the company to neutral from buy. He also reduced his second-quarter earnings estimate to 61 cents from 70 cents and 2001 earnings to $2.50 from $2.85. He made his initial 2002 estimate of $2.85.

Wall Street had been expecting Honeywell to earn 58 to 70 cents in the second quarter, $2.45 to $2.70 in 2001 and $2.85 to $3.18 in 2002, according to a survey by Thomson Financial/First Call. Average estimates were 64 cents, $2.61 and $2.97 respectively.

Sprague lowered his 12-month price target to $42.00 from $74.00. Honeywell stock was up 10 cents to $37.14 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

"Although there is potential downside in our new estimates, we doubt that the near-term outlook is as bad as some fear given the company's efforts to prepare for the GE merger," the analyst wrote in a research note.

Honeywell  Torn Between Deal and Independence
By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH
1,208 words
21 June 2001
The New York Times

Earlier this year,  Honeywell  International's chairman, Michael R. Bonsignore, expressed confidence that his company's efforts to integrate with the  General Electric  Company would pay off quickly once the deal was completed.

The merger of the two companies, of course, seems to be unraveling because of opposition from  European       regulators. Honeywell  would almost certainly remain a takeover target, but there might well be a long period where it must go it alone. And the efforts it has made to merge with G.E., while hurting it in the short run, could make it stronger in the long term.

''Honeywell has real businesses and assets that if well managed can still deliver nice returns,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager of the Dreyfus Corporation, whose funds hold both G.E. and Honeywell shares.

But creditors are not so sanguine. Moody's has said it may downgrade Honeywell's credit rating if the company remains independent. And Carol Levenson, editor of the investor newsletter Gimme Credit, is telling bondholders to avoid Honeywell. ''Almost all scenarios leave it a weaker credit than it was before its dalliance with G.E.,'' she said.

The European Commission is unlikely to block the G.E. deal officially until July, but it has already distributed a draft decision outlining its proposed rejection. And while G.E. has not withdrawn its bid, many analysts say that is mainly a tactic to prevent Honeywell shareholders from suing G.E. for abandoning the deal.

In fact, Guy P. Wyser-Pratte, a well-known speculator in takeover stocks and a Honeywell shareholder, sent a letter to Honeywell and G.E. yesterday suggesting that G.E. threw in the towel too soon and was in violation of the merger agreement.

No one doubts that Honeywell, which had $25 billion in revenue last year, can survive the breakup of the deal. Its chemicals, thermostats and other cyclical businesses have fallen prey to the softening economy. But its
aerospace businesses, which provide 40 percent of its revenue and more than half of its profits, are strong. And it has promised to cut jobs and other costs to the tune of $650 million in annual savings.

Shares of Honeywell fell $1.46 yesterday, to $37.04, well below the $56 they reached on news of the G.E. deal but above the price before the deal was announced. And while many analysts recently lowered their earnings estimates for the year -- the Thomson Financial/First Call consensus is that Honeywell will earn $2.65 a share, down from predictions of $2.70 last month -- most still rate Honeywell a strong buy.

''They've probably wasted time and money making their information technology systems compatible with G.E.'s, but their factories, sales force and distribution network are still intact,'' said David Bleustein, an analyst at UBS Warburg.

Still, most analysts agree that Honeywell continues to trade as a takeover target. Some think G.E. and the European Union may come to terms, particularly because European companies like Rolls-Royce might be eager to buy the Honeywell aerospace assets that G.E. would have to shed.



Page 94 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Others think that the United Technologies Corporation, which had been planning to buy Honeywell before G.E. made its pre-emptive bid, will renew its interest.
''Honeywell's stock will trade higher than normal unless United Technologies says it is not interested,'' said Tom
Burnett, president of Merger Insight, a research firm.

But, while that kind of speculation has gone on for a while, analysts are also accepting that Honeywell might have to go it alone. And not everyone likes the picture that poses.

''They were missing their growth targets well before the economy started to tank,'' said Robert Friedman, an analyst with Standard & Poor's. ''If they hadn't been distracted by the merger, they could have divested lackluster businesses and put in a better management team.''

Indeed, Mr. Bonsignore may be walking on eggshells. John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman who is retiring soon, and Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chairman-elect, have both stated publicly that the deal is all but dead. Mr. Bonsignore has kept quiet. But on Monday, Honeywell's board issued a statement reaffirming Honeywell's commitment to the merger.
Some saw the board's action as a slap at Mr. Bonsignore. ''Why else would the statement not come from the
C.E.O.?'' one analyst asked. An executive at a company that competes with Honeywell shared the skepticism.
''The C.E.O. is the chief spokesman,'' he said, ''and when a board issues statements itself, it's showing a lack of
confidence in the C.E.O.''

But a person close to Mr. Bonsignore insists that his position is secure. ''The board was telling the Europeans that if they hold in their objections to the deal, they will do egregious damage to Honeywell,'' the person said. ''That is more forceful as a board statement than as the rantings of a frustrated C.E.O.''

Egregious damage might be an overstatement. In fact, in some ways, Honeywell is stronger for the botched merger. Many analysts say that Honeywell, itself a product of a 1999 merger between Honeywell Inc. and the Allied Signal Corporation, has never merged those two cultures into a seamless whole. They say that nine months under the G.E. microscope has made Honeywell a leaner, meaner company.

''There's a good chance that G.E. has already encouraged them to write off obsolete assets, take restructuring charges and end unprofitable customer relationships,'' said Mr. Ghriskey of Dreyfus.

Moreover, Honeywell has for some time wanted to sell its friction materials, automotive consumer products and security monitoring units, all of which have dragged its profits down. But as soon as the merger machinery began grinding, Honeywell was constrained by pooling-of- interest rules from selling those assets. Those constraints would die with the G.E. deal. Any future acquirers would most likely wait until the lackluster businesses are gone.

Still, Honeywell has not come through this year unscathed. ''There's little question that Honeywell is filled with demotivated and disspirited people right now,'' said Christopher A. Bartlett, a professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School.

There has been no mass exodus of crucial executives. But analysts worry that many were focusing on personal postmerger prospects or on reshaping Honeywell as a component of G.E. They worry that Honeywell managers paid little attention to calculating next year's operating budgets or setting short-term strategies.

Moreover, the same G.E. scrutiny that may have whipped Honeywell into shape may drive other potential suitors away. ''The G.E. audit staff has learned everything about Honeywell's costs and pricing strategies,'' the executive at Honeywell's rival said. ''That would give G.E. a huge advantage against the company that buys Honeywell.''

So, what is the prognosis for Honeywell? Mixed. The consensus is that, while its best option is to merge, it could still be a vibrant company on its own.
''Its clothing may be tattered and torn,'' Mr. Bleustein said, ''but its organizational bones are still strong.'' Document nytf000020010712dx6l00xg5

WASHINGTON - Donald Evans, U.S. Commerce Secretary, urged Congress yesterday not to overreact against expanded global trade in the wake of the dispute with the European Commission over the proposed merger of General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. "If [the merger] does not go forward, we are going to have to step back and understand why it didn't go forward," but the U.S. should not allow a trade war to erupt over the issue, Mr. Evans told the Senate Finance Committee in a hearing on whether to grant George W. Bush trade promotion authority, which would allow the President to negotiate international trade agreements without input
from Capitol Hill.

ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn ANCHOR, AHEAD OF THE CURVE: The EuropeanCommission is reportedly under fire from U.S. Senator Ernest Hollings. According to the "Financial Times," the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee is critical on the commission`s handling of the  GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/)
-Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) merger review.
Joining me right now with more is Hugh Carnegy. He`s world news editor at the "Financial Times," in London. Hugh, please fill us in.
HUGH CARNEGY, WORLD NEWS EDITOR, "FINANCIAL TIMES": Good morning.

As you can read in our story this morning, Ernest Hollings has written to the commissioner in charge of the competition issues in the European Union, Mario Monti, accusing the EU effectively of double standards, saying that their attitude towards the GE-Honeywell merger gives credence to those who say that the EU applies double standards, that it`s being effectively protectionist in trying to stop this merger, when it allows other
Europe-to-Europe mergers to go ahead -- and expressing concern that the EU likes to have it both ways, because when there are big European companies trying to buy into the United States, the EU gets very upset if the competition authorities or the politicians in the United States try to or apply obstacles.

So I think what we`ve got here is another escalation in what has become a very political issue. You`ll remember last week, when President Bush was over here, he said he was a bit concerned about the European attitude to the GE-Honeywell merger, which it looks like the European Commission may block. Since then, we`ve just had a series of political statements and counterstatements. It`s all got rather ugly.

CHERNOFF: No question it`s gotten a little political as well. Hugh, any sense as to whether this might lead to a change in attitude in the EU?

CARNEGY: Well, Mario Monti, the commissioner in charge of this, has held the line over the last few days and actually expressed, quite angrily, this is not a political process, we have our rules, we`re going to apply them, and we will apply them on a legal and economic basis. And we`re now moving towards that July 12 deadline for the EU to say yeah or nay, and it looks like they`re going to say nay, or they`re going to ask for conditions that GE simply won`t accept.
So right now we`re in a bit of a deadlock, and it`s a little bit hard to see which way it`s going to break. CHERNOFF: Hugh Carnegy, thank you very much, at the "FT" in London.

US senator cautions EU on GE-Honeywell  deal
290 words
22 June 2001
Agence France-Presse

English
(Copyright 2001)
WASHINGTON, June 22 (AFP) - Senator Ernest Hollings, who led opposition to Deutsche Telekom's takeover of VoiceStream Wireless, warned Friday that an  EU effort to block the  merger of General Electric  and Honeywell could "undermine" US-EU relations.

In a letter to  EU trade commissioner Pascal Lamy, Hollings, the new chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said he is "troubled" by news reports indicating that the  EU plans to block the  merger of the two US industrial giants.

"I am somewhat troubled by this development since it is my understanding that this transaction received a thorough review and approval with minor modifications by both US and Canadian antitrust authorities," Hollings said in the letter which was sent to Lamy Thursday.

Hollings said that an expected merger blockage "gives credence to those who suspect that the EU is using its merger review process as a tool to protect and promote European industry at the expense of its US competitors."

The letter argued that "denial of a merger already approved by US and Canadian authorities would undermine an already strained EU-US trade relationship."

Willy Helin, spokesman for the EU delegation in Washington, said in response, "We are again surprised to see that many people present this case as a trade issue, or even a political one ... this is not a trade issue, this is a merger regulatory issue."

Hollings assumed the chairmanship of the Commerce Committee this month after the Democrats took over control of the Senate.

Political analysts expect the South Carolina senator to take an aggressive regulatory stance on foreign companies seeking acquisition opportunities in the US following his attempts to derail Deutsche Telekom's takeover of VoiceStream.

The EU is entitled  to veto the GE/Honeywell merger-but its procedures need improvement.

The EU is entitled to veto the  GE/Honeywell merger-but its procedures need improvement

JACK WELCH summed up the mood. America's most famous, and most admired, chief executive had postponed his retirement from  General Electric  to shepherd through its planned $42 billion takeover of  Honeywell,  which was to have been the world's biggest-ever industrial  merger. Last week he called the conditions that the European Commission is seeking to impose in exchange for  approving the deal "extraordinary", and went on to declare that "you are never too old to be surprised." Yet despite (perhaps, indeed, partly because of) his outburst, the commission looks certain, barring some sudden change of heart, to veto the  merger early next month.

Mr Welch's outrage is widely shared. What gives Europeans the right to block an all-American merger that was approved by America's own antitrust authorities with only minor changes? GE was quick to detect politics at work: a desire to protect Europe's own aero-engine maker, Rolls-Royce, maybe, or its civil-jet maker, Airbus. Several commentators recalled the commission's threat to block Boeing's takeover of McDonnell Douglas in 1997, which was also said to be motivated by Airbus's interests. President Bush expressed concern about a European
rejection of the GE/Honeywell merger; other American politicians even muttered about retaliation.

Such reactions are way over the top. A merger as big as this is global in effect: it is entirely reasonable that different antitrust authorities should investigate it. It is less understandable that they should reach markedly different verdicts, but it has happened before. Last year the Americans stopped the all-European Air Liquide/Air Products takeover of BOC even though the Europeans had approved it. And the Europeans blocked the
all-American takeover of Sprint by WorldCom (though that time the Americans too were opposed).

Differences remain mercifully rare. Since the Boeing/McDonnell case, the European Commission and the American antitrust authorities have improved and formalised their links. They now talk extensively and often agree which side should take the lead role. Both sides have explored the idea of a global competition forum, which may become more necessary as other countries' regulators muscle in-though the notion of a world competition authority seems premature.

The GE case does, however, give grounds for concern over the handling of big global mergers. One is that the Europeans and the Americans, as the two principal authorities involved, may be following diverging paths. Under Mario Monti, the competition commissioner, the EU is strengthening its antitrust enforcement by enlarging such concepts as "collective dominance". The new Bush administration, by contrast, appears to be weakening antitrust enforcement, for example over Microsoft. That divergence could lead to more clashes.

In the specific instance of GE/Honeywell, the commission was justified in voicing some objections, and the Americans may have let the deal through too easily. But parts of the commission's economic analysis, especially its attack on the "bundling" of different products to undercut rivals, look suspect, and its habit of shifting ground during the investigation was dubious (see article). It also seems to have relied more on claims made by GE's competitors than on evidence of harm to consumers. Even so, better negotiating tactics might have rescued the deal. This week, Mr Monti suggested that the gap between the two sides was smaller than GE was claiming. It is hard not to conclude that some inside GE may be secretly relieved that the merger looks like falling through.

The most desirable outcome of this case would, however, be a thorough rethink of Europe's merger regime. Since the commission's merger task-force came into being a decade ago, it has mostly done its work well, although it remains under-resourced. The process is commendably transparent. It is also welcome that it observes a tight timetable, since many past mergers have been undone by regulatory delay.
The biggest defect is that the commission acts as prosecutor, judge and jury. An appeal can be made to the
European Court of Justice, but that involves huge delays: the attempt by Airtours to overturn the commission's

Page 103 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
rejection in September 1999 of its merger with FirstChoice, on grounds of collective dominance, is still pending. In America, the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission have to go to court to block a merger. The commission has tried to balance its procedures by appointing a "hearing officer" charged with ensuring that companies get a fair hearing, but there is a huge difference between an internal and an external check.

One obvious solution would be to expedite the appeal procedure in the European Court. A second good plan would be to take competition away from the commission altogether and give it to a wholly independent body, free of political influence. An even more radical third idea would be to change the rules to force such a body, like its American counterparts, to go to court to block a merger. If the acquisition of Honeywell is not to be Mr Welch's last big achievement, reforms to Europe's merger regime would be a fine alternative.

The largest industrial merger ever announced is all but dead.

The largest industrial  merger ever announced is all but dead

ADMITTING he was not too old to be surprised, Jack Welch, veteran chairman of  General Electric  and mastermind of its intended  merger with Honeywell,  stomped away from Brussels on June 14th, saying that the European Commission's conditions for allowing the deal were so tough that they would fatally undermine it. But should he have been surprised? There were plenty of signs in recent weeks that the $42 billion deal was in trouble.

Waved through briskly by American antitrust authorities last month, the merger met a far more sceptical reception in Brussels. On June 19th Jeffrey Immelt, Mr Welch's successor-in-waiting, told a French newspaper that its chances of success had faded to "nil". Although a few optimists think a deal is still possible, GE has gone far beyond mere posturing.

If not surprising, the outcome is nevertheless a bit puzzling. Mario Monti, the EU's competition chief, is an adept politician who has been unafraid to stand up to big companies-among them WorldCom/Sprint and Time Warner/EMI-but who has usually managed to broker compromises when it seemed sensible. In this case, however, he played an uneven hand.

More than once he allowed his officials radically to shift the ground for their objections, creating the unfortunate impression that EU antitrust policy was being made on the hoof. He also gave most weight to objections from commercially motivated competitors of GE and Honeywell, and listened less to customers. And in the end, he failed to appreciate that, when Mr Welch told him GE had made a final offer, he meant it. After leaving their meeting on June 14th, Mr Welch made remarks that killed any scope for further negotiation.

That prompted Mr Monti to issue a defensive statement in which he deplored outside criticisms and interference, and claimed that the two sides had not been so far apart. He sent a recommendation to block the deal to EU member governments the same day. Even though some are unhappy with the commission's planned veto, it is hard to envisage any other outcome. The commission will probably make its final announcement on July 2nd.

For its part, GE was slow initially to grasp that the commission would be a lot tougher than its American counterparts. Once it woke up, GE responded vigorously. In May it attacked a so-called "bundling" theory that
until then had formed a main plank of the commission's objections. The theory held that GE could bundle sales of its aircraft engines and Honeywell's avionics into packages that would be priced to drive rivals out of business.

With its bundling theory under heavy (and largely successful) attack, the commission changed course. In early June it started to argue instead that a merged GE/Honeywell would simply be too influential in the aircraft-engines and systems businesses. Not only should it, therefore, be required to sell chunks of Honeywell's avionics
business to competitors, but it should also modify the behaviour of GECAS, GE's powerful aircraft-leasing arm.

GE refused to contemplate any dilution of its full ownership of GECAS, a highly profitable business. GE also disagreed fundamentally with the commission's argument that GECAS, as one of the world's two leading
aircraft-finance companies, wields a disproportionate influence on the market that would be strengthened by the addition of Honeywell. GE offered to give binding undertakings that GECAS would behave fairly. But the commission wanted a more radical solution: a partial spin-off.

Meanwhile, the commission demanded disposals of avionics businesses far bigger than GE had expected or was ready to concede. GE's initial offer to sell around $1 billion of avionics turnover was greeted with a demand four times bigger-and double Mr Welch's final offer of $2.2 billion. There was worse to come. After demanding specific avionics disposals of $4 billion, the commission suddenly decided that much larger chunks should be carved out

Page 105 of 144 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
in order to create sturdy competitors. It increased its demand to $7 billion. Quite how this squares with Mr Monti's suggestion that a stronger commitment on GECAS alone might have been enough to salvage the merger, only he can explain.

A nagging question, even so, is why GE stuck so firmly to its position and reacted so fiercely and definitively in public when its talks with Mr Monti ended. One answer seems plausible. Since it decided to buy Honeywell last October, the economic outlook in America and elsewhere has worsened. That may not have been enough for GE to wish it had never put in its high-risk bid. But the altered climate seems to have made GE reluctant to take the greater downside risk that would result from a restrictive deal with Brussels. Although it has left Honeywell in the lurch, GE can now at least pin the blame for the failed deal on Mr Monti. Mr Welch may be old, but he is nobody's fool.

MERGER CONTROL - LAWYERS BACK FAST-TRACK REVIEW PROCESS.
526 words
23 June 2001
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2001 European Report.
The European Commission's likely rejection of General Electric's  Euro 48 billion merger with US avionics company Honeywell  has led to calls for a fast-track review process for such business deals. At the moment, companies can appeal if the  Commission's Merger Task Force rules against a proposed deal, but the procedure can take a year or more and is very costly. It has been suggested that if the Court of First Instance could judge on cases swiftly then companies would have a legal arbiter to refer to. It would mean a proposed takeover would not be dead in the water following the  Commission's announcement.
..JJ:(JS)
"At the moment, you can appeal in theory, but the deal is dead," said Frank Fine, a competition lawyer at
Brussels-based law firm DLA. "GE/Honeywell is a landmark case and it is a perfect case for such a review if there
is belief that the companies are not in a dominant market position without bundling. It also may alleviate the
feeling in the US that the Commission is cutting down US deals. I don't think that the Commission is doing this,
but if there were a review process this would silence the critics."

A New York-based lawyer involved in competition work commented on this growing feeling in the US. "There is a strong view in the US that capitalism is capitalism and that the market should decide these cases. This is a growing political issue and Americans believe that the Commission is deciding cases in favour of European companies", he said.

One hurdle in the way of the Court of First Instance hearing competition cases is that of funding. "It sounds like a good idea, but there are resource implications and more resources would have to made available", said Alec Burnside, partner at Brussels-based law firm Linklaters and Alliance. "A simple merger appeals process may have a deterrent effect on some companies though, as it would like a sword of Damocles. Another possibility is that the Commission would not decide on anti-trust cases and would have to present its case to the Court."When
reviewing competition cases, the Court of First Instance could also analyse if there was any mission overlap in the Merger Task Force's activities in the competition field. Brussels-based lawyers involved in competition policy have suggested recently that the Commission is sole arbiter in anti-trust cases and is able to design a theory of how a market should operate and then see whether the companies' case fits such a theory.

At the moment, companies have to accept at the beginning of the Commission's investigation of a merger that its decision is final when they notify it of a transaction. However, if the Court of First Instance became a first-track review body it would mean that EU's competition process would be possibly more transparent than that in the US. At the moment, companies in the US face a long struggle in the Federal Courts to have a decision by the Department of Justice overturned.

Analysis: European Commission's objections to the GE-Honeywell merger
976 words
23 June 2001
NPR: Weekend Edition - Saturday
WKSA

SCOTT SIMON, host: For months, the proposed  merger between General Electric  and Honeywell  International seemed like a blessed union, the companies dovetailed in the aviation industry--GE making jet engines, Honeywell making those sophisticated avionics used on board aircraft. Regulators in the US  approved  the deal. Honeywell  was happy, GE seemed to glow. But just when they were ready to fasten their seat belts and prepare for takeoff, the deal fell apart. For the first time ever, the European Commission has objected to a merger between two US companies. The  Europeans  say a combined GE and Honeywell  is unfair competition in their markets.

Our friend Joe Nocera is executive editor at Fortune magazine and joins us from New York. Joe, thanks for being with us.
JOE NOCERA (Executive Editor, Fortune Magazine): Thanks for having me, Scott.
SIMON: How can a European entity scotch--forgive the expression--a deal between two American companies? NOCERA: Pretty easily, as we're finding out.
SIMON: Obviously, yes.

NOCERA: How can it happen? It can happen for several reasons. First of all, Europe, the united community, has begun to take tougher stances on, among other things, antitrust. There's a very influential head of--what we would call the head of the antitrust division of the European Commission named Mario Monte, who has really been flexing his muscles quite a bit. Why can he do this? Well, one reason he can do it is because a company like General Electric has 85,000 employees in Europe and does $25 billion of business in Europe, so that's where his power lies, and these are not companies that are divorced from the European market. These are companies that do a hell of a lot of business in the European market. And Europe has, over the last three or four years, become increasingly vocal about making demands involving American corporations.

SIMON: I guess I would understand it more if we were talking about a merger that might affect, let's say, labor practices locally in Europe, but the premise of this rejection of the European Commission is our European companies aren't geared up to compete with this massive entity that'll be created.

NOCERA: That's pretty much correct. One of the reasons this is such a difficult deal for US companies and US politicians to swallow is because they really do have a different set of rules. In the United States, this merger, with basically General Electric, which makes jet engines, and Honeywell, which makes avionics, there's no competitive issues because there's no monopoly issues. These are complementary products. In Europe, what it does to competitors matters a lot. And the European Commission has taken the position that the combination of being
able to make jet engines and being able to kind of blend it with avionics will give GE power both over the people they sell it to and power over their competitors, which they view as unleveling the playing field, and so they're basically saying no.

SIMON: There have been some people, both in the US government--I'm thinking of Commerce Secretary Evans--and even some people in the Congress, Senator Rockefeller--who have been suggesting we've got to figure out some kind of response in the United States.

NOCERA: Well, that's true. Senator Rockefeller, for all intents and purposes, threatened a trade war if this deal doesn't go through, which was pretty astounding. And, of course, he's the chairman of an aviation subcommittee, so this is not an idle threat. There is, on both sides, a feeling that the other side has no business interfering here. In other words, our Congress basically views this as two American companies and Europe should just butt its

nose out of it and they should play by our rules. The European Commission and European politicians in general do not react well to threats from American congressmen about trade wars. And, you know, the notion that this is going to cause them to back down is, I think, pretty unlikely. And their position is, `We have our sets of rules and cultures and way of thinking, and they're as legitimate as yours. And if you're going to have globalization and you're going to do business in our country, then you have to play by our rules.' So their basic position is the US Congress should butt out.

What's important to keep in mind, actually, Scott, is that this really is the first time that a deal is about to crater because of this with two US companies. I mean, companies have been willing to accept, maybe grudgingly, the fact that Europe has its own set of rules, and they have to deal with that. And that's why you've had deal after deal enter into negotiations with the European people as well as the US regulators. This is the first time where a
company has basically said, `The hell with it. It's not worth it. We're not going to go through with the deal because what you're asking is too onerous and really makes the deal not worth it.'
SIMON: Does Honeywell find another suitor now?

NOCERA: You know, they've got a problem. Honeywell is not a particularly well-run company, and one of the reasons it was attracted to General Electric is because General Electric is an astoundingly well-run company and suddenly you could help Honeywell. So if this goes away, I mean, I think Honeywell is really going to be--it's going to be in some pain.
SIMON: Joe, thanks very much. NOCERA: Thank you, Scott.
SIMON: Joe Nocera, executive editor of Fortune magazine, joining us from our studios in New York.

Trust And Antitrust
By PAUL KRUGMAN

When the European Commission indicated it was likely to block the proposed  merger between General            Electric and Honeywell,  American politicians from George W. Bush on down cried foul, with some alleging that the decision was politically motivated. They're almost certainly wrong about that, but it is true that the E.C.'s case against the  merger is far from watertight. Mario  Monti, Europe's competition referee, may have made a bad call on this play.

Nonetheless, our politicians should lower their voices. Mr.  Monti is one of the good guys in today's global economy. He should not be made the target of attempts at political intimidation.

To put the G.E.-Honeywell affair in context, you need to realize that this case is a triple switcheroo: it contradicts not one but three pieces of conventional wisdom.

First, the conventional view is that globalization weakens governments, because it forces them to compete for private investment. Broadly speaking, this view is right. (Conventional wisdom usually is.) There are, however, exceptions to the rule, and antitrust policy is one of those exceptions. In today's world, no company can compete effectively unless it can operate freely on both sides of the Atlantic -- which it can do only with a green light from antitrust authorities in both the United States and Europe. The result is that instead of eroding the power of those authorities, globalization has extended their reach: American regulators can block European mergers, and vice versa.

Second, this case inverts traditional roles. Until recently, only the U.S. seemed to take antitrust policy seriously. Europeans might have U.S.-style legislation on the books, but they often seemed to feel that cartels, like extramarital affairs, were nothing to worry about as long as the participants were discreet -- and they were
scornful toward puritanical Americans who insisted on enforcing the letter of the law. Lately, however, Europe has gotten serious about antitrust, giving the competition commissioner broad powers to block mergers and
investigate allegations of anticompetitive behavior. Mr. Monti, an American-trained university professor who assumed that office in 1999, has used those powers aggressively. General Electric and Honeywell are by no means the first companies to find Mr. Monti blocking what they thought was a done deal.

Was Mr. Monti right to block this particular deal? It's a complicated issue. Let's just say that the case against this merger is similar to the case for breaking up Microsoft, though it seems a lot weaker. On the other hand, you don't need as strong an argument to block a merger as you do to break up a going concern. We're in a gray area, with the precise shade of gray a matter of opinion.

Even if you disagree with Mr. Monti's opinion, however, his sincerity is not in doubt. The best answer to those who claim that this is really a protectionist ploy is Mr. Monti's track record: he has repeatedly shown himself willing to oppose the demands of powerful European interest groups. Why would he suddenly become a tool of protectionists?

And that leads us to the third switcheroo. Europeans are accustomed to cozy cohabitation between politicians and businessmen; Americans tend to insist on at least the appearance of an arms-length relationship. But just at the moment when the Europeans have placed competition policy in the hands of a sternly upright professor, the United States has acquired an administration that seems oblivious to normal concerns about conflict of interest.

It's not yet clear whether the Bush administration really is a government of, by and for big corporations to an extent not seen since Warren G. Harding was president, or whether it just looks that way. But the stories keep accumulating. Intel's chief lobbyist says that his highly inappropriate meetings with Karl Rove were ''quite useful'' to its merger case -- and Mr. Rove didn't even get a slap on the wrist. According to the outgoing chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the head of Enron offered to support him at the White House if he changed his policy positions. And it took three months -- and a sharp prod from Jake Tapper at Salon -- before Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill honored his promise to sell his Alcoa stock. As a consumer, I'm not sure I trust these people to protect me from the market power of giant corporations.
And so it's nice to know that Mr. Monti is out there, looking after my interests. Document nytf000020010712dx6o00yzx

FOCUS IS MISPLACED IN HONEYWELL DEAL EUROPEAN FOES STALL MERGER WITH GE

The thousands of people who work for  Honeywell  in Phoenix are getting a pretty good idea of what it's like to fly a jet fighter packed with their equipment.

Stomach-turning dives and heart-pounding loops have marked the proposed  General Electric/Honeywell           merger, which is under heavy fire by  European antitrust regulators. Even for workers accustomed to the ups and downs of the aerospace business, the last few weeks have been tumultuous.

So strong is European opposition to GE's $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell that the deal appears nearly dead, raising all sorts of questions.

For starters, if the deal falls through, what happens to Honeywell, one of the Valley's biggest companies? Honeywell boasts a highly trained and educated workforce of about 14,000 in the Valley, plus 900 in Tucson.

The European Commission fears that a combined GE/Honeywell would become virtually a one-stop shopping place, supplying engines and avionics equipment to airlines and aircraftmakers. It's also worried that a GE aircraft leasing arm would be more disposed to acquire planes with GE equipment.

At the heart of the dispute is Honeywell's operation in Phoenix, which among other things builds cockpit electronics, auxiliary power units and engines for helicopters and regional aircraft.

As a concession, GE has offered to sell off Honeywell businesses with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion, including engine operations in Phoenix. Among the possible buyers: Rolls Royce and Pratt & Whitney.

GE would still be left with Honeywell's Phoenix-based avionics component, described as the crown jewel of the deal. There is speculation that the European Commission also wants GE to sell off this business.

If the merger fails, Honeywell is prepared to go its own way, according to its chairman and CEO, Michael R. Bonsignore.

Before GE, Honeywell was a powerful company with $25 billion in annual sales around the world. Without GE, it's still a $25 billion company.

Still, the stalled merger has left Honeywell's future up in the air. Its stock has fallen, some executives have left, and new projects are subject to whether another company, such as United Technologies, winds up buying it.

On the other hand, at least one analyst points out that for the past nine months Honeywell has been under the tutelage of what many consider the best-managed company in the world and has learned plenty.

If the GE/Honeywell merger goes down in flames, it will cast doubt on other major mergers between U.S. companies that do considerable business in Europe.

The GE/Honeywell experience has at least temporarily chilled relations between U.S. and European interests and provoked a brief spat between Boeing and European rival Airbus.

In trying to shoot down the merger, the European Commission, under chief regulator Mario Monti, appears more committed to protecting its own companies against competition than doing what is best for consumers.

The much-touted global economy hinges on competition, not the protectionism fostered by the EC. If companies are to compete fairly, and consumers to benefit from that competition, EC regulators need to make some concessions themselves on a deal already approved by U.S. and Canadian authorities.

CAPTION: What will be the fate of Honeywell if European regulators CAPTION: successfully block the merger with GE? CAPTION: Honeywell's Arizona presence CAPTION: Honeywell International's 15,260 Arizona employees are waiting to hear how CAPTION: they will be affected by the pending acquisition of the company by General CAPTION: Electric.

Americans behaving  badly in Europe - American  Account.
By Irwin Stelzer.

MEN behaving badly. That is the only way to describe the characters on this side of the Atlantic who are intruding upon the brawl between Mario  Monti's EU competition commission and Jack Welch,  General Electric's  chief executive. Welch is spearheading the effort to get Monti to approve his company's $42billion acquisition of Honeywell,  the largest industrial takeover ever engineered.

Monti, of course, has signalled that he plans to support his  merger taskforce's decision of last week that  GE cannot acquire Honeywell  unless it is willing to go much further than it already has in disposing of some of its assets. Welch has offered to unload  Honeywell  units with total annual sales of $2.2billion.

Monti's problem is that even after such divestitures the merged company will include GE Capital Aviation Services (Gecas), which finances aircraft purchases and leases and is one of the world's largest buyers of aircraft and related equipment.The commission's fear is that the ability to bundle financing with equipment sales will give GE an unfair advantage over equipment suppliers who do not have a financing subsidiary.

It is difficult for anyone without access to all the records in this case, and in particular the present and likely market share of Gecas, to decide whether the commission's fears are well founded.

GE, supported by the American anti-trust authorities, which have examined and approved the merger, argues that the "bundling" theory is flawed, but nevertheless offered to construct the equivalent of a Chinese wall between its equipment and financing arms. Given the porous nature such walls have been shown to have in banking, where they have not managed to keep supposedly independent analysts from touting shares in companies that are also investment-banking clients, Monti's rejection of that solution is understandable.

If he is right that GE-Honeywell will be able to bundle financing and sales, and that this will harm competition, it is difficult to see how anything short of GE's divestiture of Gecas could correct the situation.

So Monti has offered to let GE do the honourable thing, and withdraw the deal, before he turns it down when he issues his final decision on July 12; that is, unless the EU advisory committee on mergers, which meets tomorrow, asks him to reverse field, and he decides accepting that advice is a political necessity.

But GE faces serious monetary penalties if it backs down without Honeywell's consent. And Honeywell, threatened with a credit downrating if the merger does not go through, is not quite ready to throw in the towel. So they have decided to put political pressure on Monti.

Welch, of course, needed no urging to flex his political muscles. He is personally responsible for getting regulatory approval of the Honeywell acquisition, and knows that Honeywell agreed to reject a rival offer at the last minute only on the condition that Welch postpone his retirement until the merger was consummated. He wants to go out smiling, with this huge transaction as the capstone of what everyone agrees is one of the most illustrious management careers in America's post-war history.

The GE chief has had no trouble in getting some of his friends to behave badly. Senator John DRockefeller IV (Dem-West Virginia), chairman of the Senate's aviation sub-committee, last week wrote to Loyola de Palacio,
vice-president of the European commission, threatening that an adverse decision would have "a chilling effect on transatlantic aerospace and aviation co-operation". It might also bring to an end "the open market" the US has maintained for foreign firms interested in making acquisitions in America, he said.

Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, has warned Monti to keep his hands off a deal involving two American companies. Gramm is untroubled by the facts that GE and Honeywell between them employ about 100,000

people in Europe, and that America's Federal Trade Commission recently scuppered a merger between two
Swiss pharmaceutical groups.

There is worse. President Bush used a Warsaw press conference to voice his concern about impending rejection of the deal. His secretary of commerce, Don Evans, told a Paris audience the merger was "a very positive kind of a step for free trade".

Bob Zoellick, the US trade representative, admits only to having had "discussions" with his European colleagues about the deal, but is widely believed to have thrown his weight behind Welch.

This attempt to politicise anti-trust enforcement runs counter to the direction in which Gordon Brown is sensibly taking British competition policy. He is removing politicians from the merger-review process, and leaving it to the professionals "so that decisions on individual cases are taken by independent competition authorities using a competition-based test", to quote the report he and the secretary of state for trade and industry issued last week.

And in America such an attempt by politicians to muscle either the Anti-trust Division or the Federal Trade Commission would have no chance of success. John Shenefield, who once headed the Anti-trust Division and is now one of America's most respected practising anti-trust attorneys, points out that the senators from Microsoft's home state of Washington tried to put pressure on Joel Klein, then head of the division, to end his prosecution of their most famous employer. To no avail.
There will undoubtedly be more instances in which US and EU anti-trust authorities disagree. Bush's new
anti-trust enforcers are less inclined than Monti to set store by the economic theories underlying "bundling", and
more likely to take a broader view of the marketplace in which effective competition occurs.

The world's economies can better withstand these differences than they can the politicisation of competition policy. Economists who believe that a vigorous anti-trust policy contributes to economic growth and to an opportunity society can only hope that Welch's bid to turn up the heat on Monti meets with a cool response from him and his EU colleagues.

Defence still ripe for consolidation.

Europe's largest defence companies remain convinced that the sector will see further consolidation, despite
European regulators moving to block the  merger of Honeywell  and General Electric.

At the Paris Air Show, Philippe Camus, co-CEO of the  European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), and John Weston, CEO of BAE Systems, both affirmed that they see further takeovers and joint ventures becoming a reality in the market.
The only key issue on which the two companies differed was the time scale at which this activity will take place. BAE, which already conducts almost half its business in the US, sees the process as already being well
advanced.

Weston dismissed the traditional view of separate European and US defence industries, and said that the sector was already well advanced towards transatlantic co-operation and alliances with, most notably, US players. He said the move towards a defence business that provides not individual products, but "systems of systems" was accelerating the trend.

BAE is once more in the market to buy companies after putting a moratorium on mergers and acquisitions earlier this year (see page 8).

At EADS, Camus, supported by his fellow CEO Rainer Hertrich, continued to place much emphasis on how Europe conducts its business. Both men said that more joint procurement within the continent is required to achieve necessary efficiencies.

"We are still largely dealing on a government-by-government basis and the problems that come with that," Camus said.

Correspondingly, EADS takes a more long-term view than BAE of the process that will lead to transatlantic consolidation.

While BAE sees the process already underway, EADS believes that US "partnerships and links" will develop between now and 2005, but more emphasis will fall on the consolidation of ownership and procurement within Europe during that time.

It sees the creation of leading transatlantic alliances beginning from 2005 and reaching completion towards 2010. PD

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Some European Commission members have expressed opposition to the
European Unions national competition commission's recommendation to block the  merger of General Electric
(GE) and Honeywell  (HON), the Financial Times reported Monday.

In an unsourced report on its Web site, the newspaper said no country voted against the  Commissions' proposed rejection of the deal earlier Monday and one abstained.

However, in a separate vote behind closed doors, three countries expressed regret at the failure to negotiate a solution, according to the Financial Times.

European Investigators to Explain Suggestion to Block  GE-Honeywell Merger

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission's merger investigators will explain Monday their proposed  rejection of General Electric  Co.'s bid for Honeywell  International Inc. to an assembly of  antitrust officials from the European Union's 15 member countries, Monday's Wall Street Journal reported.

Although largely a formality, Monday's meeting will open the door to criticism of the commission's conclusions about the deal. In recent days,  GE (GE) representatives have met with competition officials in EU countries to explain and defend their proposed concessions.

Despite objections some national regulators might raise, the commission is unlikely to reconsider its stance. Antitrust enforcement is one of the few areas of EU policy where the commission has direct executive power.

Before ruling on complicated cases, the commission's merger task force prefers to secure political backing from national capitals, but it's not bound by law to follow their advice. Moreover, the majority of national antitrust authorities usually side with the commission. Even GE and its negotiators have said they aren't optimistic about the deal's prospects.

GE could still try to save the deal by offering further divestitures, but it doesn't have much time. The commission is likely to make a formal decision on July 3. GE's top executives say they are finished negotiating.

Similarly, the EU says that while it believes there still is room to negotiate, it, too, is unlikely to ease its demands to the level GE is seeking. GE has said that the commission far exceeded reasonable requests. The commission has defended its conclusions while insisting that it will not bend to political pressure.

In its final proposal, made on June 14, GE offered to sell several Honeywell (HON) avionics units with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion, and to introduce separate management for GE Capital Aviation Services, the company's powerful aircraft financing and leasing arm. The commission is seeking concessions that would make it harder for Gecas, a large purchaser of aircraft, to promote GE's equipment to the detriment of competitors.

EU Members Endorse Proposal  to Block  GE-Honeywell  Deal

BRUSSELS -- European Union member countries endorsed a proposal by European Commission antitrust regulators to block General Electric  Co.'s proposed acquisition of Honeywell  International Inc., people close to the situation told The Wall Street Journal.

The vote Monday by the  EU member countries was a further blow for GE (GE), as prospects fade for its Honeywell  (HON) bid, which is currently valued at $44 billion, based on GE's stock price. The vote gives the commission's merger task force a mandate to proceed to a final decision on the deal, which is likely to be made on July 3 at a regular meeting of 20  European commissioners.

Unless GE decides to raise its earlier offer of divestitures or withdraws the merger application, the full European Commission is expected to endorse the recommendation of Competition Commissioner Mario Monti to reject the deal. GE has time to come back to the negotiating table, but the company has said that it already has made its final offer. The merger task force could theoretically tone down its objections to the deal, but that appears unlikely.

Representatives of GE, in Fairfield, Conn., and Honeywell, in Morris Township, N.J., who didn't attend Monday's meeting, declined to comment on it.

The EU member endorsement of the merger task force's position came after a debate about the merits of the case, with some EU country representatives raising questions about the commission's antitrust analysis, people close to the situation said. Still, 13 of the 15 member nations' representatives voted in favor of the task force's proposed decision, with one country abstaining and another not present at the meeting, these people said.

GE's bid to acquire Honeywell received the green light from U.S. antitrust authorities, but ran into strong opposition from their European counterparts.

Newscast:  Talks between General Electric  and Honeywell  possibly dead

NANETTE HANSEN, anchor: We may learn today whether one of the most closely watched mergers on Wall Street is, in fact, dead. We are talking about General Electric,  our corporate parent, and its attempted merger with Honeywell.  Today, the European Commission meets in Brussels to explain its proposed rejection of GE's bid for Honeywell  to EUantitrust officials. US regulators have already approved  the $42 billion deal, but EU officials are worried that the combined company would dominate the avionics and jet engine fields. CNBC's Leslie LaRoche is following the story. She joins us live from Brussels with the very latest.
Good morning, Leslie. LESLIE LaROCHE reporting: Good morning, Nanette.
Well, what we know is that Mario Monti--he's the competition commissioner for the European Union--he is meeting with the advisory committee. That is made up of national regulators. Now this is an advisory meeting. These national regulators have no authority to change Monti's--what we know is his draft decision to block that deal. So this is as much a sort of political consensus building meeting as much as anything else because
they--they are not likely to disagree with Monti. And as I mentioned, they can't change his decision.

Now Mario Monti has the ultimate responsibility of taking any final decision to the full commission for a vote. That final decision and vote could come next week on Tuesday, July 3rd. That's the latest from Brussels. Nanette, back to you.

JAN HOPKINS, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP: Let`s bring in our guest host again, Jim Glassman of Techcentralstation.com. Jim the market is down on a day that, you know, people should be looking forward to the Federal Reserve meeting. What`s weighing on this market?

JIM GLASSMAN, TECHCENTRALSTATION.COM: Well, I think there are three things that are going to contribute to a recovery. One is the cuts in rates. The other is the tax cuts and I don`t think the market quite recognizes how important those are. But the third really is politics, regulatory policy. I think the decision by the Europeans  to turn down, and it`s imminent, the  Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) , GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/) merger has a huge impact. It really - this is the bread - this is the Europeans  fighting back against our competition through regulation.
HOPKINS: We`ll talk more about it after the break. Thanks, Jim Glassman. END

GE deal gets EU review

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Antitrust officials from the 15  European Union nations Monday took up the draft decision of merger regulators on General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell International Inc., a deal widely expected to be formally  rejected next week.

The advisory committee, comprising representatives from national competition agencies, reviews conclusions made by the EuropeanCommission, the EU's executive body, on big merger deals and makes recommendations.

EU officials say however that the Commission is unlikely to change its position when the merger comes up for a vote, expected on July 3. GE president Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published last week that he saw "zero" chance the deal would be approved.

Enforcement of antitrust law is one of the few areas in the EU where the Commission is empowered to act on its own. Its decisions can be challenged in court, as MCI Worldcom did after the EU rejected its purchase of Sprint, but companies usually abandon their deal long before any court ruling can be made.

The EU's hard line on the GE-Honeywell deal, which won conditional clearance in the United States last month, has provoked criticism from the Bush administration and members of Congress.

U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller last week sent a letter to the Commission urging a "fair" decision and warning that a rejection "could have a chilling effect on future trans-Atlantic aviation and aerospace cooperation."

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the EU's decision would not be swayed by attempts at "political intervention."

In its last attempt to meet EU objections to the deal, GE said it offered to divest Honeywell units totaling $2.2 billion in annual sales but that the Commission was demanding "billions" more.

Monti, however, said that GE could have kept some of the Honeywell units it was offering to sell if it had agreed to "a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior of" GE Capital Aviation Services, GE's aircraft financing and leasing unit.

The highly profitable GECAS is one of the world's leading purchasers of aircraft. The commission has cited concerns that bundling GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and GECAS financing would give the combined company enough market power to eventually drive competitors out of business, resulting in higher prices.

"If we feel in the long run a merger is going to translate into higher prices, we definitely can't give it the green light," an EU official said on condition of anonymity.

GE has said it offered to set up GECAS as a separate entity to deal at arms length with Honeywell and ensure it doesn't discriminate against Honeywell rivals.
But that apparently did not go far enough to satisfy Commission regulators, who initially pressed GE to spin off
GECAS to the company's existing shareholders. GE negotiators had dismissed that option as unacceptable.

European Commission Set to Explain Planned Rejection  of GE-Honeywell  Deal

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission's merger investigators will explain today their proposed  rejection of General Electric  Co.'s bid for Honeywell  International Inc. to an assembly of  antitrust officials from the European Union's 15 member countries.

Although largely a formality, today's meeting will open the door to criticism of the commission's conclusions about the deal. In recent days,  GE representatives have met with  competition officials in EU countries to explain and defend their proposed concessions.

Despite objections some national regulators might raise, the commission is unlikely to reconsider its stance. Antitrust enforcement is one of the few areas of EU policy where the commission has direct executive power.

Before ruling on complicated cases, the commission's merger task force prefers to secure political backing from national capitals, but it's not bound by law to follow their advice. Moreover, the majority of national antitrust authorities usually side with the commission. Even GE and its negotiators have said they aren't optimistic about the deal's prospects.

GE could still try to save the deal by offering further divestitures, but it doesn't have much time. The commission is likely to make a formal decision on July 3. GE's top executives say they are finished negotiating.

Similarly, the EU says that while it believes there still is room to negotiate, it, too, is unlikely to ease its demands to the level GE is seeking. GE has said that the commission far exceeded reasonable requests. The commission has defended its conclusions while insisting that it will not bend to political pressure.

In its final proposal, made on June 14, GE offered to sell several Honeywell avionics units with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion, and to introduce separate management for GE Capital Aviation Services, the company's powerful aircraft financing and leasing arm. The commission is seeking concessions that would make it harder for Gecas, a large purchaser of aircraft, to promote GE's equipment to the detriment of competitors.

Editorial Commentary
Transatlantic Misunderstanding: The European Commission protects the wrong people
By Thomas G. Donlan

Some observers of international antitrust enforcement say the main difference between European and American regulation is that American regulators are concerned about the impact on consumers while Europeans  are concerned about the impact on competitors, especially those based in  Europe.

It certainly looks that way in the case of the proposed  merger of General Electric  and Honeywell.  American regulators approved  it quickly, noting that the would-be partners offer few, if any, directly competitive products. But the European Commission's main man on antitrust, Mario Monti, seems to be most concerned about the possibility that the combined companies would bundle their aerospace product offerings and give customers unmistakably better deals.

Noel Forgeard, the head of Airbus Industrie, certainly underscored that impression when he declared that he had endorsed the GE-Honeywell merger in private conversations with Monti after receiving GE Chairman Jack Welch's promise not to bundle GE jet engines and Honeywell avionic equipment into a low-price package, especially not in a bundle with a lease from GE Capital.

Forgeard should not have sought such an assurance and Welch should not have given it. It goes directly against the interests of airline clients and their customers, the flying public. It even goes against the interests of Airbus (and Boeing), which might be able to sell more planes if GE can offer cheaper equipment and financing for them. It suggests a greater restraint of trade than anything the EC fears GE and Honeywell might do.

The fear of monopolies is almost always overdone. Contrary to theory, monopolies have often reduced prices and advanced the interests of consumers. But Monti and the European Commission are not afraid of monopolies.
They are afraid of the market.

Deal Me Out: Arbs are hurting as merger activity sputters, risks rise
By Andrew Bary
1,306 words

After two strong years of performance, takeover arbitrageurs are having a tougher time in 2001 because of reduced merger activity, tightening spreads, and high-profile blowups such as  General Electric's  all-but-dead deal to buy Honeywell  International. The  Merger Fund, which is the only mutual fund focused on takeover arbitrage, was up 1.8% for the year through Thursday after having fallen 2% during June. The $1.1 billion fund, a reasonable proxy for the performance of the burgeoning arbitrage community, rose 17.4% in 1999, 17.5% in 2000 and hasn't experienced a losing year since its inception in 1989. (The fund is closed to new investors.)

Arbitrageurs collectively are estimated to have lost around $1 billion on the GE/Honeywell  deal. While officially alive, the GE/Honeywell merger is widely expected to be called off, given antitrust objections from the European Union and discouraging comments from  GE executives.
The stock market certainly suggests a very low likelihood of a deal, with Honeywell finishing last week at 36.50,
$18 below the stated value of the GE offer. GE has rallied about 10% lately to 52 amid arbitrage buying and
apparent relief on Wall Street that GE's management won't be distracted by Honeywell integration issues.

The Honeywell disaster has contributed to rising concerns about the fate of several other high-profile deals, including PepsiCo's $14 billion acquisition of Quaker Oats and Nestle's $10 billion purchase of Ralston-Purina. "I've never seen our peers quite so twitchy," says Fred Green, president of Westchester Capital Management, which runs the Merger Fund.

Quaker Oats fell 2.15 to 91.55 last week amid unconfirmed reports that the Federal Trade Commission is taking a hard look at the Pepsi combination and may move to block the deal. Quaker now trades at a wide spread of
almost $13 per share below the value of the offer from Pepsi, which is set to pay 2.3 of its shares for each Quaker share. Pepsi rose 2.22 to 45.48 last week.

Ralston declined 0.50 in the week to 29.90, finishing $3.60 below the $33.50 a share cash offer from Nestle. Ralston now trades at its lowest level since the deal was announced in January. Dean Foods, which is being purchased by Suiza Foods, also declined last week, dropping $1.47 to 39.29 after Dean warned of
weaker-than-expected profits in the current quarter. Dean now trades $4 under the value of the Suiza offer. Takeover arbs typically buy shares in the target company and sell short the shares of the acquirer in order to pocket the spread.

The GE/Honeywell blowup surprised Wall Street because GE chairman Jack Welch had virtually guaranteed success and because no merger that passed muster with U.S. antitrust regulators has ever been blocked in Europe. That raised the specter of greater global antitrust scrutiny of U.S. mergers at a time when the Street has been banking on more lenient American antitrust policies under the Bush Administration. One reason that Ralston dropped last week is the fear that U.S. may retaliate against the Europeans by trying to block the bid by Switzerland's Nestle. One positive development for the arb community was the recent decision by a Delaware judge that Tyson couldn't pull out of its merger with IBP. That should make it harder for companies to break
merger agreements.

The widening arbitrage spreads could present an opportunity for investors willing to bet that deals will occur. "Our view is that Pepsi and the FTC will find common ground and the Quaker deal will get done," says Bill Pecoriello, analyst at Sanford Bernstein.

The main antitrust issues in the Quaker transaction involve Pepsi's plan to sell its sports beverage drink, All Sport, so that it can take control of Quaker's crown jewel, Gatorade. All Sport is a weak No. 3 brand behind Gatorade

and Coca-Cola's Powerade, and the concern is that All Sport will no longer be competitive once its purchased by the little-known Monarch Co. The other issue involves Pepsi's rising sway over the convenience-store business if it buys Quaker.

Pecoriello's view is that neither matter is enough to scuttle the deal, which he thinks has a better than 75% chance of going through. Pecoriello says the risk/reward with Quaker looks good because the company probably worth at least $80 on a standalone basis and could garner takeover offers from such companies as Danone if the Pepsi deal fails.

John McMillin, the food analyst at Prudential Securities, says he's telling investors to "hold on" to both Quaker and Ralston because he thinks chances are high that both deals get approved. He scoffs at the idea that the U.S. will get back at Europe by blocking Nestle's bid, noting that Switzerland isn't even part of the EU.

While the Nestle/Purina combination would create a pet-food powerhouse, Nestle has publicly stated that it is willing to consider divestitures to satisfy antitrust regulators. Ralston, however, probably doesn't have the same appeal to other potential buyers as Quaker. It could drop to 25 if the deal collapses.
The WorldCom/Intermedia situation is intriguing because Intermedia, which finished Friday at 13.52, trades for
$1.40 below the current value of the WorldCom offer. Intermedia holders will get one WorldCom share, worth
$14.29 and 0.04 shares of MCI tracking stock for each of their shares. The Intermedia spread widened sharply
last week even though the deal is due to close on July 1. If the deal comes apart at the last minute, Intermedia
likely would collapse since it is a debt-laden telecom company that attracted WorldCom because of its majority
ownership of Digex, the Web hosting company. The fear in the arb community is that WorldCom may look for a
last-minute way to nullify the deal because the Web hosting business now is in terrible shape, evidenced by the
collapsing share price of industry leader Exodus Communications. Yet the Tyson decision encourages arbs here
because buyers now have less latitude to walk away from bad deals.

The arbitrage community has been hindered because too much money has been chasing too few deals with merger activity down over 50%. At the same time, the amount of capital tied up in the arb business has swelled to an estimated $50-$100 billion, primarily from hedge funds and trading desks run by banks and brokers.

It's ironic that nearly three years after the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge-fund industry is embracing many of LTCM's strategies albeit without the enormous leverage used by LTCM. Absolute return strategies are hot because investors, having been burned in the stock market, especially in high-octane tech funds, now are happy to pocket 10%-15% annual returns.

The hedge-fund industry is booming and arbitrage is one of the most popular strategies along with other "absolute return" approachs like convertible arbitrage, distressed securities, bond arbitrage and long-short equity. Absolute return strategies aim to generate steady returns regardless of the direction of the stock market or interest rates.

But with more money chasing fewer opportunities, returns are suffering. Convertible arbitrage hedge funds, which now dominate the $170 billion convertible market, lately have suffered. Takeover arbitrageurs, meanwhile, historically have aimed to generate around 15% annual returns before fees, but relatively safe situation like Tyco International's purchase of C.R. Bard have projected returns of below 10%.

Green, though, is optimistic about second-half returns for the Merger fund because the recent widening in arb spreads is creating greater opportunities.

EU panel reviews GE deal; zero hope

Antitrust officials from the 15  European Union nations today took up the draft decision of  merger regulators on General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., a deal widely expected to be formally rejected next week.

The advisory committee, comprising representatives from national competition agencies, reviews conclusions made by the European Commission, EU's executive body, on big merger deals and makes recommendations. No further meetings were expected after today's session, an  EU source said on condition of anonymity. No details on the results were released.

GE representatives were not involved, although they have met with some competition officials in EU capitals in recent days to explain and defend their proposed concessions, GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said.

EU officials say however that the Commission is unlikely to change its position when the merger comes up for a vote, expected on July 3. GE president Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published last week that he saw "zero" chance the deal would be approved.

The EU's hard line on the GE-Honeywell tie-up, which won conditional clearance in the United States last month, has provoked criticism from the Bush administration and members of Congress.

The Commission has cited concerns that bundling GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and GECAS financing would give the combined company enough market power to eventually drive competitors out of business, resulting in higher prices.

EU committee supports veto of GE Honeywell merger

ATTENTION - ADDS detail

BRUSSELS, June 25 (AFP) - The  European Union committee on mergers and acquisitions came out on Monday against a proposed  merger between US giant  General Electric  and Honeywell,  a source close to the committee said.

The veto should be finalised on July 3 when the EuropeanCommission -- the EU's competition watchdog -- holds its next formal meeting.

The source said that new information, which led Britain and Germany to request further talks with the companies concerned, was "incorrect" and that the committee, a consultative body, had not discussed the possibility of returning to the negotiating table.

He said all but one of the committee members -- representing the competition regulators in the 15 EU states -- said they supported the stance taken by EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.
GE has said it expects Monti to veto the 45-billion-dollar (52- billion-euro) merger on July 12. The source said the dissenter was a "small" EU country, without giving details.
GE, the world's biggest conglomerate, with interests ranging from aerospace to finance and media, announced its plans to purchase Honeywell last October and unify the two companies' aerospace activities.
US officials have already given a green light the deal, leaving the EU as the last hurdle. sbo-phv/gil

Honeywell  Bid Is Likely Dead, Says GE.(General Electric  Co.)(Brief Article)

FAIRFIELD, CT -- The president of General Electric  Co., Jeffrey R. Immelt, recently stated that his company's proposed $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell  will probably be blocked by European regulators and is very likely dead. However, he said that  GE would wait to get the final determination next month.

Europe's antitrust regulators believe the merger would give the company considerable market power in the aviation industry, and asked that  GE sell off major parts of its aircraft businesses. The company would not agree to the concessions.

At an air show in Paris, France, Immelt said, "We are very far apart as we sit here today, and fundamentally we are planning our future without Honeywell."

Jack Welch, chairman and ceo of GE, stated, "Jeff Immelt and I wanted to complete the transaction but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal. The [European] Commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point.... In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisors imagined, and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the U.S. and Canada."
According to The New York Times, United Technologies, which had earlier lost out to GE in its attempt to acquire
Honeywell, is now considering another bid.
The European Commission's decision on the GE-Honeywell merger is set to be made by July 12. FULL TEXT

Europe's  Merger Unit To Explain Rejection  Of GE's Offer --- Companies,  Commission Seem Unlikely  to
Resolve Impasses

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission's merger investigators will explain today their proposed  rejection of General Electric  Co.'s bid for Honeywell  International Inc. to an assembly of  antitrust officials from the European Union's 15 member countries.

Although largely a formality, today's meeting will open the door to some criticism of the  commission's conclusions about GE's proposed acquisition of  Honeywell.  In recent days,  GE representatives have been meeting with competition officials in  EU countries to explain and defend their proposed concessions.

Despite any objections some of them might raise, however, national antitrust officials are unlikely to force the commission to reconsider its stance. Antitrust enforcement is one of the very few areas of EU policy where the commission has direct executive power.

Before ruling on complicated cases, the commission's merger task force prefers to secure political backing from the national capitals, but it isn't bound by law to follow their advice. Moreover, the majority of national antitrust authorities usually sides with the commission. Even GE and its negotiators have said they aren't optimistic about the deal's prospects.

GE could still try to save the deal by offering more divestitures. However, there's very little time left for the company to do so because the commission is likely to make a formal decision on July 3. GE's top executives have said repeatedly that they are done negotiating. Similarly, the EU has reiterated that while it believes there still is room to negotiate, it, too, is unlikely to reduce its demands to the level GE is seeking.

In its final proposal made June 14, GE offered to sell several Honeywell avionics units with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion (2.57 billion euros) and to introduce separate management for GE Capital Aviation Services, the company's powerful aircraft financing and leasing arm. The commission accuses Gecas, a large purchaser of aircraft, of promoting GE's equipment to the detriment of competitors, and it continues to seek a remedy that would render such promotion more difficult.
The commission has asked GE to either sell more of Honeywell's core businesses or come up with a more
far-reaching remedy to separate Gecas. GE has balked at demands for greater divestitures from Honeywell and
also has rejected any measures that would leave it with less than 100% ownership of Gecas. U.S. authorities
have already approved the deal.
