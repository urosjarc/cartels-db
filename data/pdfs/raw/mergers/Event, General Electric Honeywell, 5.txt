GE-Honeywell  Deal Being Reviewed

By PAUL GEITNER AP Business Writer
580 words
25 June 2001
AP Online

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Antitrust officials from the 15  European Union nations Monday took up the draft decision of merger regulators on General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell International Inc., a deal widely expected to be formally  rejected next week.

The advisory committee, comprising representatives from national competition agencies, reviews conclusions made by the EuropeanCommission, the EU's executive body, on big merger deals and makes recommendations.

No further meetings were expected after Monday's session, an EU source said on condition of anonymity. No details on the results were released.

GE representatives were not involved, although they have met with some competition officials in EU capitals in recent days to explain and defend their proposed concessions, GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said.

EU officials say however that the Commission is unlikely to change its position when the merger comes up for a vote, expected on July 3. GE president Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published last week that he saw "zero" chance the deal would be approved.

Enforcement of antitrust law is one of the few areas in the EU where the Commission is empowered to act on its own. Its decisions can be challenged in court, as MCI Worldcom did after the EU rejected its proposed purchase of Sprint, but companies usually abandon their deal long before any court ruling can be made.

The EU's hard line on the GE-Honeywell tie-up, which won conditional clearance in the United States last month, has provoked criticism from the Bush administration and members of Congress.

U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller last week sent a letter to the Commission urging a fair decision and warning that a rejection "could have a chilling effect on future trans-Atlantic aviation and aerospace cooperation."

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the EU's decision would not be swayed by attempts at "political intervention."

In its last attempt to meet EU objections to the deal, GE said it offered to divest Honeywell units totaling $2.2 billion in annual sales, but that the Commission was demanding billions more.

Monti, however, said that GE could have kept some of the Honeywell units it was offering to sell if it had agreed to "a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior of" GE Capital Aviation Services, GE's aircraft financing and leasing unit.

The highly profitable GECAS is one of the world's leading purchasers of aircraft. The Commission has cited concerns that bundling GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and GECAS financing would give the combined company enough market power to eventually drive competitors out of business, resulting in higher prices.

"If we feel in the long run a merger is going to translate into higher prices, we definitely can't give it the green light," an EU official said on condition of anonymity.

GE has said it offered to set up GECAS as a separate entity operated at arms length with Honeywell and ensure it doesn't discriminate against Honeywell rivals.

Page 5 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But that apparently did not go far enough to satisfy Commission regulators, who initially pressed GE to spin off GECAS and give up ownership to the company's existing shareholders. GE negotiators had dismissed that option as unacceptable.

World Stock Markets: Europe's  Merger Unit To Explain Rejection  Of GE's Offer --- Companies, Commission Seem Unlikely  to Resolve Impasses

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission's merger investigators will explain today their proposed  rejection of General Electric  Co.'s bid for Honeywell  International Inc. to an assembly of  antitrust officials from the European Union's 15 member countries.

Although largely a formality, today's meeting will open the door to some criticism of the  commission's conclusions about GE's proposed acquisition of  Honeywell.  In recent days,  GE representatives have been meeting with competition officials in  EU countries to explain and defend their proposed concessions.

Despite any objections some of them might raise, however, national antitrust officials are unlikely to force the commission to reconsider its stance. Antitrust enforcement is one of the very few areas of EU policy where the commission has direct executive power.

Before ruling on complicated cases, the commission's merger task force prefers to secure political backing from the national capitals, but it isn't bound by law to follow their advice. Moreover, the majority of national antitrust authorities usually sides with the commission. Even GE and its negotiators have said they aren't optimistic about the deal's prospects.

GE could still try to save the deal by offering more divestitures. However, there's very little time left for the company to do so because the commission is likely to make a formal decision on July 3. GE's top executives have said repeatedly that they are done negotiating. Similarly, the EU has reiterated that while it believes there still is room to negotiate, it, too, is unlikely to reduce its demands to the level GE is seeking.

In its final proposal made June 14, GE offered to sell several Honeywell avionics units with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion and to introduce separate management for GE Capital Aviation Services, the company's powerful aircraft financing and leasing arm. The commission accuses Gecas, a large purchaser of aircraft, of promoting GE's equipment to the detriment of competitors, and it continues to seek a remedy that would render such promotion more difficult.
The commission has asked GE to either sell more of Honeywell's core businesses or come up with a more
far-reaching remedy to separate Gecas. GE has balked at demands for greater divestitures from Honeywell and
also has rejected any measures that would leave it with less than 100% ownership of Gecas.

Analysis: European antitrust officials review planned merger of General Electric  and Honeywell  and are widely expected to reject it

RON INSANA, co-anchor: Antitrust officials from the 15 nations of the  European Union gave the planned merger between General Electric  and Honeywell  their final review today. It's widely expected the EU will formally reject the merger next week. Thomas Knipp is associate editor of The Wall Street Journal Europe. He joins us this evening from London.
And, Thomas, what are the latest developments after the meeting today?

Mr. THOMAS KNIPP (Associate Editor, The Wall Street Journal): Well, Ron, I think it doesn't look good for GE at the moment. As you just said, it's with a majority. We hear the number of 13 out of the 15 gave them the thumbs down; one or two abstained. And there was only a little bit of discussion about how the commission in all, you know, approached the whole case. As far as we know at the moment, there was no real debate about the foundations, the theories upon which they acted, which were discussed quite a bit in the in--international arena recently.
So as far as it looks at the moment, it's very, very likely that the EU commission will--will vote to block the deal on
July the 3rd, unless--that is, unless GE sweetens the deal or withdraws the notification.

INSANA: All right. Now what about the European reaction among CEOs on the continent? What are they having to say about all this?

Mr. KNIPP: Well, it's very interesting. The eu--The Wall Street Journal Europe, the Dow Jones had the annual CEO meeting here in--in London today, and they will have it tomorrow. And it was, you know, not really on the program but, you know, in every break, there was a big discussion about the case. And what, you know, CEOs really want to see, what bankers want to see is, you know, some security. They want to have some, you know, safe rules, something they can rely on to plan such--these kind of deals. And what they are--really would like to see is the old days back when the EU and the US anti-competitive authorities were really closely cooperating and trying to, you know, make deals possible.
INSANA: Thomas, very quickly, is there anything GE can still do to save the deal?

Mr. KNIPP: W--yes. Well, there is something they can do. They can either sell more of their business, or they can change the way one of their operations is--is acting at the moment--GE, you know, airline, Capital Services.
That's what the commission is really looking for, but GE already said they wouldn't do that because it would cut to the--to the core of the strategy GE as a global company has, i.e., to avert that the--the s--s--the units work very closely together. And, therefore, I think they could do that, but it's very unlikely that they will.
INSANA: Thomas Knipp of The Wall Street Journal, thank you very much. Document bctr000020010710dx6p000ie

SUE HERERA, co-anchor:  European regulators have given the proposed merger between General Electric and Honeywell  a final review, and are expected formally to  reject that merger next week. If the deal is rejected, what's next for the two companies? Joining us with more on that part of the story is The Wall Street Journal's finance editor Steve Lipin.
Steve, good to see you again.
Mr. STEVE LIPIN (The Wall Street Journal): Hi, Sue.
HERERA: All right. What is next for GE if regulators dump the deal?

Mr. LIPIN: Yeah. Well, I think, obviously, we have Chairman Welch retiring probably around September. And there are some people on Wall Street who are a bit more skeptical about this stock and the company's prospects in the near term because they liked the Honeywell deal. They liked what it added to the margins. And they're a little bit concerned that without Honeywell, GE may not be able to sustain its--its great growth and track record in the next year or two. And obviously, the Street has been waiting for this for some time now. The fact that it looks like it's not going to occur, I think, is a little bit of bad news that people are still trying to digest.

HERERA: Yeah. What about United Technologies, which a lot of people think will come back into the game and make a bid for Honeywell? I mean, there was talk of that before GE stepped in, obviously.

Mr. LIPIN: Right. Right. I mean, for Honeywell the issue is: What happens now? And while they've said, I think, that they could go to loan, the fact is, is that United Technologies started this ball rolling last year, and, you know, we think they're interested. But it's like if you know that a seller needs to sell their house and you're the only buyer, you're going to wait awhile and see what happens.
(Graphic on screen)
United Tech (UTX) 73.56 up 0.09 [+0.12%]

Mr. LIPIN: And I think United Technologies wants to know that, first of all, they do the due diligence because Honeywell has disappointed a bit on the Street in the last six months. But more significantly, they may not offer the same price that they offered a year ago since they may be the only buyer left.
HERERA: Yes.

Mr. LIPIN: So I think they're going to wait a little bit and pl--let this--see how this--how this plays out, and maybe try to be a little more opportunistic.

HERERA: Put this in the big picture if you will, Steve. These were two American companies that were trying to merge. They got approval here in the US and in Canada.
Mr. LIPIN: Right.
HEREA: So what does this mean to the future of future trans-Atlantic mergers?

Mr. LIPIN: I don't think this is good news. I think the fact is that there's going to be much more of a wait-and-see attitude on the part of the corporate chieftain and their deal makers. I mean, if a deal like this cannot go through and the companies don't really compete directly in the same businesses, there are a lot of companies that are going to think twice before they do big megadeals. And that's bad news for the M&A market. And, to a certain extent, I think it's bad news for trans-Atlantic relations, because if this deal gets killed--you know, there's already

Page 9 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
been threats on the part of US senators that perhaps we try to retaliate. And that cannot be good news for--for both corporate America and for the European business community.
HERERA: On that note, Steve Lipin of The Wall Street Journal. Steve, thank you very much. Mr. LIPIN: Sure.

BRUSSELS, June 25 (Reuters) - Some sources said that a meeting of European Union countries on Monday produced strong support for a  merger task force of experts who evaluated General Electric  Co's proposed purchase of Honeywell  International Inc.

These sources, with knowledge of reports about the meeting being circulated inside the the  Commission, say all the countries endorsed the experts' opposition to the deal. One small country abstained, these sources say. They say that some countries expressed regrets that the merging companies had not been willing to offer remedies that were acceptable.

But another source familiar with the views of those in the meeting expressed certainty of a split in the vote and a unanimous demand for further negotiations by the Commission with GE.

Efforts  to sway EC on GE case may have backfired.
By Peter Kaplan

25 June 2001

Reuters News
LBA

(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - U.S. efforts to goad European antitrust regulators into approving General
Electric  Co.'s bid to buy  Honeywell  International Inc. may have backfired, U.S. antitrust attorneys say.

Public statements by top-ranking U.S. officials this month, ranging from concern to outright criticism, seemed designed to help push the  merger through at the  European Commission, but look to have had the opposite effect.

"It may have hardened the EC's position instead of having the intended effect of encouraging more flexibility," said Larry Fullerton, a former U.S. Justice Department official at the firm of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy.
On Monday a European Union advisory committee voted in support of EC staff objections to the deal, but a final
Commission vote is at least a week or more away.

Competition agencies on both sides of the Atlantic pride themselves on decisions they think are made on the merits, said one prominent antitrust attorney in Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity. "They often get their backs up when they feel that someone is trying to muscle them politically."

President George W. Bush and members of his cabinet, including U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, took the rare step of speaking out publicly after the deal ran into trouble with European antitrust enforcers.

After General Electric called the White House for help with the deal, Bush said on May 15 that he was "concerned that the Europeans have rejected it."

The White House has denied that Bush's statement interfered with the European Union's review, saying that he had merely "reiterated the American position" on the merger which was approved by the Justice Department in May with modest changes.
CORPORATE LOBBYING

Nevertheless, the comments surprised and perplexed antitrust experts. "He (Bush) looked for all the world like a corporate lobbyist," said one New York attorney.
The comments from the administration provoked a sharp retort from European Competition Commissioner Mario
Monti early last week.

"I deplore attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political intervention," Monti said. "This is entirely out of place in an antitrust case and has had no impact on the commission whatsoever."

Some U.S. antitrust experts said General Electric may have gotten more than it bargained for when it called on the White House for help.

"I suspect they didn't ask for all of it," said Fullerton, the former Justice Department official. "My guess is that this is not a coordinated, well thought-through campaign."

Monti's response came as no surprise to American attorneys who handle international mergers. European officials, they said, cannot tolerate the impression that they are giving in to U.S. pressure.



Page 13 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"It just seems to me so obviously predictable that the response from Monti would be negative," said Andrew Gavil, a professor at Howard University Law School.

The last time U.S. officials questioned a decision by European antitrust regulators was 1997, when the Europeans resisted Boeing Co.'s acquisition of McDonnell Douglas.

In that case, the United States had a more credible complaint, however: The EC's tough stance was widely seen as an attempt to protect Europe's government-owned Airbus Industrie. In the end, the Europeans reached a compromise with Boeing and approved the deal.
In the GE-Honeywell deal, it's less clear why U.S. officials went public with their concerns.

"You would think that if (administration officials) had been trying to make an impact, they would have worked behind the scenes, not out front," Gavil said.

By publicly questioning the commission, antitrust attorneys said, the Bush Administration made it even harder for the EC officials to compromise.

"You do not want to put your opponent in a position where to agree with you would be to lose face," said Joseph Andrew, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee who now works as a private attorney handling mergers and acquisitions. "That may be what happened here."

Vincent Brophy, an associate at Brussels-based law firm Linklater & Alliance, agreed that public U.S. pressure may have hardened the opposition among EC staff.

But Brophy said the pressure campaign may have been designed to bypass the EC antitrust regulators and exert influence directly on European Commissioners, who ultimately vote the merger up or down.
"They couldn't get the commission (staff) to move, maybe they can get the politicians to move," Brophy said. Document lba0000020010712dx6p00w4o

BRUSSELS, June 25 (Reuters) - A  European Union advisory committee backed  Commission experts Monday and opposed General Electric  Co.'s purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc on a split vote, then unanimously asked the Commission to talk further with the companies, a knowledgeable source said.

The countries split 10 to 4 in favor of the view of the  merger task force experts, with Britain among those dissenting, the source said. Greece did not attend.

Not all of the large EU countries were among the four dissenters, but they nonetheless expressed serious concerns about the Commission merger task force analysis of the deal. Britain, France, Italy and Germany were adamant that the Commission and GE should hold further talks.

The large countries also stressed that the Commission should be looking to its absolute deadline of July 12, and worry less about meeting the July 3 date on which the Commission is set to vote.

A key European Union advisory committee voted to  reject General Electric  Co.'s proposed $42-billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc., supporting the recommendation of an expert panel, sources said.

But in a glimmer of hope for the deal, sources said the vote contained conditions that would require the  European Commission to first restart negotiations with GE. Sources said 14 of the 15  European Union member nations attending the meeting had voted against the merger, but the sources differed on whether the final vote included conditions.

The committee recommendation next moves to European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, who will consider it before going to his fellow commissioners next month. They are to vote on Monti's recommendation by July 12.
GE shares fell $1.61 to $50.25, while Honeywell fell $1 to $35.60, both on the NYSE. Document latm000020010712dx6q0141i

EU's Monti: Need To Analyze Differences On Mergers -FT

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)-  European Union competition commissioner Mario Monti Tuesday said a
divergence in opinions by international regulators on proposed mergers should be analyzed so it may be avoided
in the future, the Financial Times reported.
The European commission's decision Monday to block the proposed merger of General Electric  (GE) and
Honeywell  (HON) merger has been widely criticized in the U.S. where regulators would have permitted it.

On its Web site, the Financial Times said Monti, in a speech to the American chamber of commerce, pointed to another instance where the U.S. and European regulators had differed: the BP-Amoco (BP) takeover of Atlantic Richfield.
"A very special effort should be made to analyze in a cold and professional way the reasons (for the divergence)
and to see how it could be avoided in the future," Monti said, according to the Financial Times.
Also, Richard Morningstar, outgoing US ambassador to the EU, criticized the lack of transparency in the EU
process and said the issue could affect EU-US relations on antitrust issues, the Financial Times reported.

Hurdle higher for GE merger plan: Play for Honeywell: Most EUregulators back Monti's  aim to block
US$44B sale

BRUSSELS - European antitrust officers yesterday backed the Competition commissioner's plan to block General Electric  Co.'s US$44-billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., a EuropeanCommission official said .

A majority of  antitrust officers from the 15 European Union governments supported Mario  Monti while one abstained, the official said. Some asked the commission to leave the door open to further concessions by  GE, the official said.
Negotiations can continue if GE is willing to make more changes to its plan, EU officials have said.

GE said last week its concessions to European regulators won't go beyond an offer to sell businesses with US$2.2-billion in revenue and separate the accounts of its plane-leasing unit. President and chairman-elect Jeff Immelt told France's Le Monde that there are "zero" chances of winning approval.

"I'd look at Immelt's remark that the deal has a 'zero' chance for your guide," Michael Holton, a fund manager at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., said before yesterday's meeting.
The commission must rule on the takeover by July 12.

Rejection would be the first time the EU has acted alone to halt a U.S. takeover. The EU can block or force changes to mergers between companies with combined global sales of 5 billion euros (US$4.3-billion), even if they are not based in Europe.

GE had sales of US$130-billion last year, while Honeywell's revenue was US$25-billion. The companies have received the tentative go-ahead in the United States and Canada. The EU can prohibit takeovers on its own, while U.S. regulators have to prove their case in court.

U.S. regulators have acted unilaterally as well. Last year, United States barred Air Liquide SA and Air Products & Chemicals Inc. from buying BOC Group Plc for US$12.9-billion after they had obtained European approval.
"I really don't think it's going to go forward at this point," said Marcy Yeamans, an analyst at Banc One Investment
Advisors.

GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., is the biggest maker of aircraft jet engines and owns one of the biggest aircraft leasing operations. The commission has said it's concerned that the leasing unit might dictate what parts are used on new planes.

GE and Honeywell have two hopes for saving the merger. One is that competitors and customers will advise the commission to accept GE's concessions. The other is that GE offers a new way of scaling back the plane-leasing operations.

Mr. Monti must take yesterday's recommendation from the national representatives under consideration, though it's not binding.

BRUSSELS, Belgium - Antitrust officials from the 15  European Union nations Monday took up the draft decision of merger regulators on General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., a deal widely expected to be formally rejected next week.

The advisory committee, comprising representatives from national competition agencies, reviews conclusions made by the EuropeanCommission, the EU's executive body, on big merger deals and makes recommendations.

No further meetings were expected after Monday's session, an EU source said on condition of anonymity. Results were not released.

An unidentified EU source told Dow Jones Newswires that the advisory committee members were "almost unanimous" in supporting the commission's proposed rejection of the deal.

If true, that would make it unlikely that the commission would change its position when the merger comes up for a vote, expected July 3. GE President Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published last week that he saw "zero" chance the deal would be approved.

GE representatives were not involved, although they have met with some competition officials in EU capitals in recent days to explain and defend their proposed concessions, GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said.

Enforcement of antitrust law is one of the few areas in the EU where the commission is empowered to act on its own. Its decisions can be challenged in court, as MCI Worldcom did after the EU rejected its proposed purchase of Sprint, but companies usually abandon their deal long before court rulings are made.

In its last attempt to meet EU objections to the deal, GE said it offered to divest Honeywell units totaling $2.2 billion in annual sales, but that the commission was demanding billions more.

EU antitrust advisers  vote to bar GE deal for Honeywell  --- Hurdle higher than anticipated, analyst says

European antitrust advisers have backed a plan to block General Electric  Co.'s $67 billion (Canadian)
purchase of Honeywell  International Inc., a European Commission official says.

But, in a glimmer of hope for the deal, a source familiar with the situation said yesterday's vote contained conditions that would require the  commission to restart negotiations with  GE before rejecting the merger outright.
The deal, worth about $45 billion (U.S.), has already won the approval of U.S. and Canadian antitrust regulators. Its rejection which highlights the difference in regulatory approaches in North America and Europe means that
troubled Honeywell may have to start looking for another suitor, analysts said.
A majority of antitrust officers from the 15 European Union governments supported Competition Commissioner
Mario Monti, the official said.

"At this point, there's very little chance this deal gets done," said analyst Bill Fiala of Edward Jones in St. Louis, Mo.

Both Honeywell and GE declined to comment. But GE president Jeffrey Immelt has said that he saw "zero" chance the deal would be approved.

A source told Reuters EU member nations voted to support the commission's position, subject to further discussions to see whether any last-minute deal could be worked out. Some member nations also said the commission should look to its absolute deadline of July 12 to make its decision, and worry less about the next scheduled vote on July 3.

GE made what it called a final offer two weeks ago to sell businesses with $2.2 billion (U.S.) in revenue and separate the accounts of its plane-leasing unit to allay concern it would dominate the aerospace-products markets.
But the concession did not meet EC demands.
"Everyone knew Europe would be a higher hurdle, but no one dreamed it would be this high," Fiala said. While U.S. and Canadian antitrust regulators concentrate on whether the deal would ultimately lead to lower
prices for consumers, the EC considers the impact on competition in the industry, believing that less competition
will ultimately lead to higher prices.

"This deal would have created an 800-pound gorilla in aerospace and that concerned European regulators," Fiala said.

The deal's collapse would have little effect on GE, analysts said. New Jersey-based Honeywell, however, has been troubled since its merger with Allied Signal two years ago.

"They're going to continue to struggle, maybe even looking for another suitor to come in and take over," said stock analyst Rob Plaza at Morningstar in Chicago.
"Honeywell's the one that's really going to have to find a new road map," Fiala said. Rejection would be the first time the EU has acted alone to halt a U.S. takeover.
Last year, the United States barred Air Liquide SA and Air Products & Chemicals Inc. from buying BOC Group
PLC for $12.9 billion after they had obtained European approval.

GE-Honeywell  Exposes Flaws in Antitrust Policy
By George Melloan
1,102 words
26 June 2001
The Wall Street Journal

General Electric  Chairman Jack Welch was surprised when he learned that the  European Commission was turning thumbs down on  GE's $40 billion merger with Honeywell  International. So were a lot of other people. The fact that both are U.S.-based had Americans asking what business Brussels has  rejecting a merger of two U.S. companies?

EC Competition Commissioner Mario Monti affably explained the European Union position to Journal editors in New York a few months ago. If a merger affects  competition in Europe, it falls within his purview, he said. U.S. trustbusters take the same approach toward mergers of foreign firms with extensive operations in the U.S. Last year, the U.S.  antitrust division blocked an attempt by France's Air Liquide and America's Air Products to split between them the assets of a British industrial gases producer, BOC.

So although Mr. Monti's jurisdictional claims may raise threats of retaliation from the likes of South Carolina Sen. Fritz Hollings, they are not a particular issue among regulators themselves. The trustbusters think they have a logical formula for enforcing antitrust laws in an age of globalized multinational corporations.

Maybe they have, but this geographic division of labor makes problems for the companies they regulate. Klaus F. Becher, a DaimlerChrysler lawyer, noted at a hearing of the International Competition Advisory Committee two years ago that companies have to win approval in an increasing number of jurisdictions as antitrust laws proliferate. State attorneys general have gotten into the act in the U.S., most notably with the Microsoft case. Janet McDavid of Hogan & Hartson told her colleagues at the hearing that she was working on a deal that required approvals in 27 jurisdictions.

The more filings required, the higher the costs and the greater the likelihood of deal-killing time delays. Lawyers also chafe at regulator demands for sensitive information, such as business plans, that could be very useful to competitors if leaked. Plaintiff lawyers in private antitrust suits sometimes demand that regulators provide them with this information.

EC regulators have acquired a reputation for revealing sensitive information while going public with their antitrust concerns. Ms. McDavid told of a visit by a client firm's executives to Mr. Monti's predecessor, Karel van Miert, who styled himself as a giant-slayer fighting the good fight for European consumers. They discovered the room full of reporters and photographers, "which wasn't exactly the way they had anticipated conducting the meeting."

Public choice theorists argue that it is impossible to divorce the decisions of regulatory bureaucrats from their own self interests. They are not mere regulators of economies, they are themselves players, whose careers and future may hinge on how boldly they regulate. The EU's 50-member merger task force, by those lights, cannot be altogether regretful that it brought one of the world's largest and best-managed corporations to its knees -- although the fact that GE's stock went up and Honeywell's went down after their bombshell may have puzzled them a bit. In the U.S., former Clinton antitrust chief Joel Klein appeared to positively relish the renewed prominence he gave to his office, and his own image, with high-profile cases like Microsoft.

Quite likely, most trustbusters believe that they are doing the Lord's work. Certainly, Mr. Monti, a Yale-trained Italian academic, thinks so. Before the competition authority came into being, Europe had a long tradition of what America's 1890 Sherman Act called "restraint of trade or commerce." It grew out of the ancient guilds formed by tradesmen to protect themselves from competition. Government-sanctioned business cartels developed after the Industrial Revolution. After World War II, socialism gripped Europe. Even in West Europe, governments

Page 24 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
nationalized some key industries and promoted "national champions" among private companies, in both cases destroying market competition.

The EU competition authority was charged with breaking those old habits. Clearly, it has played some role in urging privatization of state-owned companies and introducing greater competition. But how much of a role is hard to say. Many state-owned corporations simply fell of their own bureaucratic weight. International free-trade agreements and the creation of the single market were the major factors in forcing European producers to become more competitive.

Whatever the successes of European pro-competition efforts, they are subject to the doubt that has always afflicted antitrust policy. Put succinctly: At what point does antitrust regulation cease to promote competition and begin to inhibit it? In other words, how much regulation is really needed to give consumers markets that deliver efficiency, high quality and optimum prices?

It is widely accepted, except perhaps by the most devout libertarians, that markets need some state regulation to guard against fraud and rapacity. At the very minimum, it is argued, producers should be barred from conspiring to fix prices, on grounds that to do so defeats the very principle of market competition. U.S. antitrust law reserves severe penalties for business executives found guilty of price-fixing.

But trustbusters have a habit of pursuing dubious academic theories about what destroys competition. Very often they come up with the bizarre notion that the villain is competition itself! Hence Microsoft was hounded for combining a Web browser with its operating system to steal a march on competitors. In Europe, GE was accused of a nefarious plot to "bundle" products by combining Honeywell avionics with GE engines so as to offer an attractive package deal to aircraft makers.

In both Microsoft and GE-Honeywell, the main complaints came not from consumers but from competitors. Hence the quite valid question arises of whether at some point trustbusters stop serving the interests of consumers and become more intent on providing competitors with that mythical land called a "level playing field." Is it possible to do both? The antitrust regulators defend themselves by arguing that by "bundling" and other competitive tactics, companies endeavor to drive competitors out of business and ultimately to monopolize an industry themselves.

But the threat of a future monopoly is a mere theoretical construct. It might or might not happen. Maybe the merger will fail because of an internal culture clash, or maybe the colossus will become too big and slow to adapt to market changes. The immediate corporate goal is to make itself more competitive, not less. Why not wait to see what happens before getting out the sledgehammers?

The advisory committee, comprising representatives from national competition agencies, reviews conclusions made by the EU's executive body on big merger deals and makes recommendations.
Support from EU governments would strengthen the Commission's hand in recommending a rejection of the

Its decisions can be challenged in court, as MCI Worldcom did after the EU rejected its proposed purchase of Sprint, but companies usually abandon their deal long before any court ruling can be made.
The GE-Honeywell deal won conditional clearance in the United States last month.

GE has sought to overcome EU objections by offering to divest Honeywell units totaling $2.2 billion in annual sales, but company officials have said the Commission was demanding billions more.

Monti, however, said GE could have kept some of Honeywell units if it had agreed to "a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior" of GE Capital Aviation Services, GE's aircraft financing and leasing unit.

The highly profitable GECAS is one of the world's leading purchasers of aircraft. The Commission has cited concerns that bundling GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and GECAS financing would give the combined company enough market power to drive competitors out of business, resulting in higher prices.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Union antitrust chief said Tuesday he was "entirely satisfied" with support from  EU governments of his review of General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. - a deal widely expected to be formally  rejected next week.

Addressing a group of competition lawyers, EU CompetitionCommissioner Mario Monti said EU governments gave the Commission "almost unanimous support" at a meeting Monday of EU national competition authority officials.

He declined to say what the Commission's final decision will be. A final ruling on whether to allow or reject the giant merger is expected at a July 3 meeting of the 20-member European Commission. The official deadline for an EU ruling is July 12.

An EU source, who asked not to be named, said at Monday's meeting, the national competition authorities "fully backed the commission's analysis in this merger with the exception of one country which abstained."

The advisory committee, comprising representatives from national competition agencies, reviews conclusions made by the EU's executive body on big merger deals and makes recommendations.
Support from EU governments would strengthen the Commission's hand in recommending a rejection of the
GE-Honeywell merger when put to a vote.

GE president Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published last week that he saw "zero" chance the deal would be approved.

Enforcement of antitrust law is one of the few areas in the EU where the Commission is empowered to act on its own. Its decisions can be challenged in court, as MCI Worldcom did after the EU rejected its proposed purchase of Sprint, but companies usually abandon their deal long before any court ruling can be made.
GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said GE and Honeywell executives met Monday.
"We remain fully committed to our final proposal," Sheffer said. "We continue to have discussions concerning it." Sheffer would not comment further on the meeting. Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane would not confirm a
meeting took place, calling it "speculation," and declined further comment.
The GE-Honeywell deal won conditional clearance in the United States last month.

GE has sought to overcome EU objections by offering to divest Honeywell units totaling $2.2 billion in annual sales, but company officials have said the Commission was demanding billions more.

Monti, however, said GE could have kept some of Honeywell units if it had agreed to "a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior" of GE Capital Aviation Services, GE's aircraft financing and leasing unit.

The highly profitable GECAS is one of the world's leading purchasers of aircraft. The Commission has cited concerns that bundling GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and GECAS financing would give the combined company enough market power to drive competitors out of business, resulting in higher prices.

A European Union committee has come out against a proposed US$45 billion  merger between US giant
General Electric  and Honeywell.

A source close to the committee on mergers and acquisitions said all but one of the committee members supported the stance taken by  EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.
GE has said it expects Mr Monti to veto the merger.

The veto should be finalised on July 3 when the European Commission, the EU's competition watchdog, holds its next formal meeting.

GE, the world's biggest conglomerate, with interests ranging from aerospace to finance and media, announced its plans to purchase Honeywell last October and unify the two companies' aerospace activities.
US officials have already approved the deal. Document cnewas0020010711dx6q0055a

Without  GE, Honeywell  breakup is possibility

The 15-country European Commission soon is expected to formally  reject General Electric's  $45 billion stock offer for Honeywell  International.

Honeywell,  which moved its headquarters from Minneapolis to New Jersey in late 1999 as part of its  merger that year with the former AlliedSignal, remains "optimistic" that the deal will be  approved.  The company adds that it's "prepared for any outcome."
One analyst joked Monday that there's more chance of Elvis returning than of the EU approving a deal. Honeywell CEO Mike Bonsignore faces tough options if that's the case. Steve Roorda, an analyst at American
Express Financial Advisors, believes that against the backdrop of an earnings decline, a slowed economy, turmoil
from layoffs and the long wait for the fate of the GE offer to be decided, Honeywell's board of directors might:

- Peddle the company, perhaps to United Technologies, the original suitor for Honeywell last fall after Bonsignore wound up in Wall Street's doghouse after earnings fell short of optimistic projections.

But don't expect United Technologies to offer the $50 per share it planned before huge GE topped it with a $55 offer last October.
"I think $45. Honeywell's numbers are lower this year," Roorda said.

- Liquidate the company "piece by piece" in the event United Tech or other buyer doesn't come forward for the weakened conglomerate.
- Regroup and and go forward independently, the least likely option.

"That board is divided and I don't really know how [Bonsignore] stands," Roorda said. "But most of these deals that I've seen get broken up . . . it takes two-plus years to get things back on track. Things grind to a halt. There's management turmoil. People leave while you're trying to be acquired."
A fine state of affairs, but it illustrates the point that big- bang mergers often don't work.

Salomon Smith Barney last week lowered Honeywell's 2001 earnings estimate to $2.50 a share from $2.85, citing, among other things, "possible internal disruptions caused by the [GE] deal's apparent collapse."
Salomon said the stock is properly priced in the high $30s but might drop if the company decides to go it alone. Honeywell's stock trades well below the level it hit before the 1999 acquisition premium it gained on the high
hopes over the AlliedSignal deal.

By contrast, Graco and Donaldson Co., two steady, well-run Minneapolis-based manufacturers have turned in a better stock performance since 1999.

It's most likely Honeywell's board will peddle the company ASAP to appease the arbitrageurs and angry shareholders who now control the stock.

Bonsignore's bid to more than double Honeywell in size to $25 billion in sales, integrate a huge merger and hit 15 percent, quarter- over-quarter earnings increases, proved too long a shot. Honeywell's internal expansion plan before the Allied deal called for smaller, strategic acquisitions within its business lines of aerospace systems, building controls and security systems, former executives told the Star Tribune last fall.

"The legacy of Bonsignore at this point is naivete," said Fred Zimmerman, a professor of management and technology at the University of St. Thomas and a critic of the AlliedSignal deal from the get-go. "We know a lot about mergers and these kinds of problems. Certainly you could see the AlliedSignal `P&L' and a lot of fluff and no- growth segments and little cash."
Can the Honeywell board blame this on the Europeans?
They can only blame themselves. Political risk is as much a consideration as economic and market risk. The
Europeans have a history of defending their aircraft-systems market.

Honeywell was a well-run, well-regarded, global company headed for $10 billion in revenue from its century-old headquarters in south Minneapolis before the Allied deal. Bonsignore, one of the Twin Cities' best and most community-engaged executives, and his board of directors look much the worse for wear from their bout of "mergeritis."
Pemstar to Russell 2000

Pemstar is the kind of technology stock that the anything-goes equity markets of recent years wouldn't have cared much about.
Pemstar was too substantive, with real customers, growth and profits. Now, it's getting some attention from the more selective markets.
The Rochester-based electrical design, engineering and manufacturing company this month raised $80 million in a secondary stock offering. That offering follows last August's initial public offering that raised $102 million.

The stock has actually eked out a small gain - from $11 last August to $12 per share recently - during a crushing time for the tech sector generally.

This morning, the fast-growing, profitable firm will announce that it has been named to the Russell 2000 Index, the benchmark index of companies under $1 billion in market value compiled by the Frank Russell Co.
Pemstar has a current market value of $404 million.

Al Berning, 46, Pemstar's CEO, said the inclusion in the Russell 2000 is an endorsement of the company's growth track and should enhance Pemstar's visibility in the investment community.

Berning said he considered it fortuitous that Pemstar was able to go public last August in a lousy market for technology stocks.

"We were fortunate to not go public during the frothy times of 1999 and early 2000," Berning said. "A lot of employees said they were hoping the stock would jump up three or four times in value. I said, `No, you're not.' The stock price has held up. We've learned a lot in this market."

A lot of hot-promise, no-profit tech stocks leapt from their IPO prices only to tank as the far-fetched nature of their business plans became apparent. The flameouts left behind a lot of scorched investors.

Pemstar, which posted net earnings of $6.7 million, or 25 cents per share, on sales of $635.3 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, is a designer and manufacturer of products for the likes of 3M Co., Honeywell, Guidant, IBM and Motorola.

"You move faster in high tech if you can leverage partnerships as opposed to doing all by yourself," Berning said. "We run our factories with six to 12 customers.

"In spite of the tech downturn, we're working hard . . . and the opportunities are out there, particularly on the project design and tech-development area."

Pemstar helps manufacturers improve efficiency by working with them on product development, design and manufacturing.

In a year of downward earnings revisions, Pemstar told analysts recently that its orders so far in 2001 give confidence that the company can meet consensus expectations for a near doubling of earnings per share to 48 cents in fiscal 2002 on a double-digit increase in revenue.
Pemstar, founded in 1994 by former senior managers who ran IBM's storage-products operation at its big
Rochester plant, employs about 4,000 people in 15 facilities worldwide, including 800 in Rochester.
Directors and officers own about 12 percent of the stock.
Neal St. Anthony can be reached at 612-673-7144 or Nstanthony@startribune.com. Lower profile, higher stock prices
Two years after Honeywell and Allied Signal announced their merger, Honeywell shares have fallen 37 percent. Meanwhile, two lower- profile Minnesota manufacturers, Graco Inc. and Donaldson Co., are delivering positive results despite a slowing economy.

TRADE WAR LOOMS - BUSH MULLS BAN ON IMPORTED STEEL
Paul Tharp

A trade war moved closer to erupting yesterday following  Europe's latest vote to scuttle the $42 billion  merger of
General Electric  and Honeywell.

Just as the European Commission was casting its vote yesterday to block the  merger, President Bush hurled his first protectionist bombshell.

Bush - always a champion of free trade - formally ordered U.S. trade officials to investigate whether the U.S. should block Europe and other nations from shipping steel here.

Bush had threatened last week in the wake of the GE crisis to take moves against steel imports, a prime goal of organized labor here for years.
European leaders were outraged by Bush's threat.

"The U.S. doesn't cease to promote protectionist measures when it's a question of protecting their own market from competition," said Fernand Wagner, chief executive of one of the world's largest steel exporters, Arbed SA of Spain.

Meanwhile, cracks began to appear in the EU's opposition to the GE deal. In a closed EU meeting separate from the EU's vote, at least three countires - believed to include France and Britain - broke from the others to go on record to express regret that no one could reach a negotiated solution, the Financial Times reported.
It raised the possibility that negotiaitons could be reopened.

The EU says that the deal can still happen if GE agrees by July 12 to sell assets that would dilute its control over the manufacture of both jet engines and electronics gear.
GE said late yesterday it had no plans to revise its deal. GE stock fell $1.61 to $50.25 in a selloff of more than
26.8 million shares. Honeywell lost $1 to $35.60.
Other trade skirmishes also have erupted as the GE-Honeywell stalemate intensified in recent days. Reacting to Washington pressures, EU Environmental Commissioner Margot Wallstroem accused Boeing of
"nonchalantly" disregarding possible environmental damage with its planned Sonic Cruiser.

The EU also is doing more saber-rattling in its fight to eliminate the U.S. tax breaks that American companies get for doing business abroad.
The EU said it's prepared to seek $4 billion in sanctions over the tax breaks, following a regulatory ruling late
Friday by the World Trade Organization that the tax breaks are in violation of trade rules.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, who's lobbied to get the GE deal cleared, reacted by saying that if the EU imposes the $4 billion in sanctions it would be akin to dropping a "nuclear weapon" on relations between two of the world's biggest trading partners.

Meanwhile, a firestorm of protest has taken hold on Capital Hill, with Sens. Ernest Hollings, Jay Rockefeller, Robert Torricelli, Herbert Kohl, and Mike DeWine all expressing concern about the EU's authority.

Hollings, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, warned in a letter to the EU:
"Denial of a merger already approved by U.S. and Canadian authorities would undermine an already strained
EU/US trade relationship. I urge the EU to consider their actions very carefully on this important matter."

EU ANTITRUST PANEL REVIEWS GE ACQUISITION STRONG OPPOSITION EXPECTED

Antitrust officials from the 15  European Union nations Monday took up the draft decision of  merger regulators on General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., a deal widely expected to be formally rejected next week.

The advisory committee, comprising representatives from national competition agencies, reviews conclusions made by the European Commission, the EU's executive body, on big merger deals and makes recommendations.

No further meetings were expected after Monday's session, an EU source said on condition of anonymity. No details of the results were released.

An unidentified EU source told Dow Jones Newswires that the advisory committee members were "almost unanimous" in supporting the commission's proposed rejection of the deal.

If true, that would make it unlikely that the commission would change its position when the merger comes up for a vote, expected July 3. GE President Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published last week that he saw "zero" chance that the deal would be approved.

GE representatives were not involved, although they have met with some competition officials in EU capitals in recent days to explain and defend their proposed concessions, GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said.

Enforcement of antitrust law is one of the few areas in the EU where the commission is empowered to act on its own. Its decisions can be challenged in court, as MCI Worldcom did after the EU rejected its proposed purchase of Sprint, but companies usually abandon their deal long before any court ruling can be made.

The EU's hard line on the GE-Honeywell merger, which won conditional clearance in the United States last month, has provoked criticism from the Bush administration and members of Congress. Honeywell is based in Morris Township.

U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., last week sent a letter to the commission urging a fair decision and warning that a rejection "could have a chilling effect on future trans-Atlantic aviation and aerospace cooperation."

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the EU's decision would not be swayed by attempts at "political intervention."

In its last attempt to meet EU objections to the deal, GE said it offered to divest Honeywell units totaling $2.2 billion in annual sales, but that the commission was demanding billions more.

Monti, however, said that GE could have kept some of the Honeywell units it was offering to sell if it had agreed to "a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior of" GE Capital Aviation Services, GE's aircraft financing and leasing unit.

The highly profitable GECAS is one of the world's leading purchasers of aircraft. The commission has cited concerns that bundling GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and GECAS financing would give the combined company enough market power eventually to drive competitors out of business, resulting in higher prices.

"If we feel in the long run a merger is going to translate into higher prices, we definitely can't give it the green light," an EU official said on condition of anonymity.

GE has said it offered to set up GECAS as a separate entity operated at arm's length with Honeywell and to ensure that it doesn't discriminate against Honeywell rivals.

But that apparently did not go far enough to satisfy commission regulators, who initially pressed GE to spin off GECAS and give up ownership to the company's current shareholders. GE negotiators had dismissed that option as unacceptable.

Tricky business of merger policy

When the US President, Mr George Bush, made his first visit to  Europe this month there was much talk about the need to strengthen economic ties between the world's two dominant economic groupings. But as the political leaders were meeting, the differences between their competition regulators over a large proposed company merger was exposing a fissure between the US and the European Union that needs to be repaired.

The $80 billion  merger between the US conglomerate  General Electric  and aerospace manufacturer  Honeywell was already generating attention before it hit the informal agenda of the meeting between the leaders of the North Atlantic alliance.  GE's long-standing chairman, Mr Jack Welch, offered to delay his retirement to persuade Honeywell's  directors to agree to the deal instead of to an alternative offer from United Technologies. And as the largest industrial company  merger, the takeover was being presented as a new benchmark in the globalisation of business.

But now it looks as good as finished since the EU's competition regulators have imposed conditions which GE says it is not prepared to accept. The fact that GE and Honeywell are US companies and the merger had been waved through by the US Justice Department with minor changes has only added to the tensions.

With a couple of weeks until the deadline for a final EU ruling, and Mr Welch said to regard the merger as the crowning glory of his career, it is quite possible that the stand-off reflects the sort of negotiating that often occurs at this point in a big competition policy decision.

But if it does not go ahead, serious questions will arise over whether the efforts in recent years to improve communications and policy direction between the competition regulators in the US and Europe have come unstuck just when the world needs more harmonious global competition rules. The uncertainty about the real nature of the differences between competition authorities in the two jurisdictions mostly affected by global mergers comes as the Bush Administration is expected to adopt a less intrusive approach to competition law.

While there has been US political criticism of the way a deal between two US-based companies can be stopped by an EU commissioner, the reality is that GE and Honeywell are just as much European companies, employing more than 100,000 people in their European operations. In that case it is not surprising that competition
regulators outside the US would want to consider the impact such a merger would have on their economies. They should, however, be able to come to more harmonious views about how the same company would operate.

For example, the initial big difference in this case was over the issue of "bundling", with EU anti-trust officials arguing that GE would bundle its sales of aircraft engines and Honeywell's avionics in a way that would force other companies out of business.
The US authorities don't believe that companies can easily bundle their products in this way.

This difference represents a philosophical conflict that would severely complicate future trans-Atlantic mergers and would be likely to arise again quickly in relation to the long-running Microsoft case. The philosophical differences have receded somewhat, with the EU backing off on the bundling issue in favour of a more direct call for divestiture, because the GE-Honeywell combination would be too powerful in the avionics and engine sectors.

The trans-Atlantic anti-trust authorities have fallen out before, perhaps most significantly when the EU also challenged a US merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. But aerospace is particularly prone to


Page 40 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
trans-Atlantic rivalries and most other mergers get approval because regulators on both sides know that global business can't work if they are completely at loggerheads.

While US authorities now seem inclined towards less severe competition policy approaches, the opposite is increasingly the case in Europe. Last week, for example, in Britain, the Blair Government announced it was introducing jail sentences for directors guilty of price fixing, echoing calls from Australia's competition chief, Professor Allan Fels, for tougher penalties to deal with anti-competitive tendencies arising from globalised business.

The GE-Honeywell case has again generated debate about the need for some form of world competition authority that would parallel the World Trade Authority. This is something that global business trends suggest should be seriously considered, although it is more important in the meantime to reach better philosophical agreement among existing regulators about how merged global companies actually operate.

Trade-Offs for Open Trade?

In the weeks ahead, President Bush will need some bucking up on his commitment to open trade. Lately, many nations of the world have been treating such trade without what Mr. Bush calls the necessary "moral imperative."

China and Japan, for instance, have descended into a bitter dispute over low-priced Chinese farm exports, like shiitake mushrooms. And the European Union has initially  rejected a merger of two American companies, General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc., in a serious difference with the United States over antitrust policy.

And the EU may impose $4 billion in sanctions against the US after a ruling last week by the World Trade Organization against US tax supports for US exports. Any such sanctions, warned Trade Representative Robert Zoellick in rare ballistic language, would be like using a "nuclear weapon" on the global trading system.
And those are just the skirmishes.

A larger trade battle is now being waged in Congress, which appears ready to slap labor and environmental restrictions on the president's ability to negotiate open-trade deals. Such restrictions run the risk of scaring off nations that need a more-open American market for their exports in order to provide jobs for their poor (that's the moral imperative part).

And without that presidential authority to negotiate deals under strong US leadership, the next round of talks aimed at expanding global trade will falter again, as it did in Seattle two years ago. The WTO's 140 members hope to launch the new round of trade in November.

Bush himself raised concerns about his commitment to open trade last week by seeking a probe on whether steel imports unfairly hurt US steelmakers.

It's not easy for leaders to stand for open trade, especially when roving bands of antiglobalization protesters threaten to disrupt trade meetings.

Bush himself largely defines his foreign and trade policy as that of narrowly seeking US interests. In the short-term, open trade does often hurt many US interests - job losses, etc. But over time, the US economy adjusts and then benefits in growth, technology, and low inflation.

The president also sees open trade as uplifting the poor and promoting political freedom. Those more universal goals should not be lost as nations make a difficult transition from their protectionist past. (c) Copyright 2001. The Christian Science Monitor

EU commissioner pleased with EU support for his ban on GE-Honeywellmerger

BRUSSELS, June 26 (AFP) - European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said Tuesday he was "entirely satisfied" with the support from EU member state merger officials to his proposed ban on the fusion of General Electric  and Honeywell  International.
The European Union's committee on mergers and acquisitions came out on Monday against the proposed
merger of the two US multinationals, a source close to the committee said.

The veto should be finalised on July 3 when the European Commission -- the EU's competition watchdog -- holds its next formal meeting.

Monti, speaking to the American Chamber of Commerce in Brussels, said he was "entirely satisfied with the almost unanimous support given by the advisory committee to the commission's draft prohibition decision," he said.

EU hits back at US senator over GE-Honeywell
542 words
26 June 2001
Agence France-Presse
AFPR
English
(Copyright 2001)
BRUSSELS, June 26 (AFP) - The  European Commission lashed out on Tuesday at a US senator who accused the EU's competition watchdog of adopting a "political" approach to the planned  merger of US industrial giants General Electric  and Honeywell.

The 45-billion-dollar (52-billion-euro) merger, which will bring together the two companies' aerospace activities, has been approved  by US anti-trust regulators but needs a green light from the  Commission before it can go ahead -- a prospect even  GE fears is unlikely.

In a letter circulated on Tuesday, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti and EU Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio said "concerns" expressed on June 19 by Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the head of the US Senate's sub-committee on aviation, were "wholly unfounded".
Monti and de Palacio said Rockefeller had written to the Commission, echoing US concerns that the
"Commission's competition policy would discriminate against US companies because (its) activities would be
'driven principally by a desire to protect European aerospace companies from strengthened but legitimate US
competition'".
In fact, they said, this was absolutely not the case.

"We would like to reassure you that the concerns to which you refer about the operation of the European Union's merger rules are wholly unfounded.

"Our competition policy, whether in relation to mergers or anti- trust matters more generally, is firmly based on the fundamental principle of non-discrimination," the commissoners said.

They said the Commission has been reviewing mergers and acquisitions for over 10 years and had each time, as in this particular case, applied the same test -- "whether or not the market would remain sufficiently competitive so that consumers would continue to have products to choose from at competitive prices".

"The nationalities of the companies and political considerations have played, and will play, no role in the examination of this proposed transaction," Monto and de Palacio stressed.

"Recents attempts to politicise the Commission's review process are consequently entirely displaced," they concluded.
To back up their position, Monti and de Palacio attached to their letter to Rockefeller a table summarising the
1,649 merger cases examined by the Commission between September 1, 1990, and June 21, 2001.
In all, the Commission vetoed only 14 planned tie-ups.
Of the 394 cases involving at least one US company, only one proposed merger was blocked by Brussels. The commissioners stressed that several US firms had complained to Brussels about the negative effects the
GE-Honeywell merger could have on their business and participated actively in a hearing the Commission had
organised on the issue in late May.

"By contrast, and contrary to what has been said, large aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus have not been particularly active in the proceedings," they pointed out.

The Commission is widely expected to announce on July 12 that it is blocking the GE-Honeywell deal, after GE's refusal to make all the concessions demanded by Brussels.

However, a spokewoman for GE told AFP on Tuesday the firm did not intend to withdraw its request for clearance of the merger.

"We have no plans to withdraw the (merger) notification... (GE) remains remains fully committed to the proposal," she said.

GE-Honeywell  Exposes Flaws in Antitrust Policy

General Electric  Chairman Jack Welch was surprised when he learned that the  European Commission was turning thumbs down on  GE's $40 billion merger with Honeywell  International. So were a lot of other people. The fact that both are U.S.-based companies had Americans asking what business Brussels has  rejecting a merger
of two U.S. companies.

The Commission's competition commissioner, Mario Monti, affably explained the European Union position to Journal editors in New York a few months ago. If a merger affects  competition in Europe, it falls within his purview, he said. U.S. trustbusters take the same approach toward mergers of foreign firms with extensive operations in the U.S. Last year, the U.S.  antitrust division blocked an attempt by France's Air Liquide and America's Air Products to split between them the assets of a British industrial gases producer, BOC.

So although Mr. Monti's jurisdictional claims may raise threats of retaliation from the likes of South Carolina's Sen. Fritz Hollings, they are not a particular issue among regulators themselves. The trustbusters think they have a logical formula for enforcing antitrust laws in an age of globalized multinational corporations.

Maybe they have, but this geographic division of labor makes problems for the companies they regulate. Klaus F. Becher, a DaimlerChrysler lawyer, noted at a hearing of the International Competition Advisory Committee two years ago that companies have to win approval in an increasing number of jurisdictions as antitrust laws proliferate. State attorneys general have gotten into the act in the U.S., most notably in the Microsoft case. Janet McDavid of Hogan & Hartson told her colleagues at the hearing that she was working on a deal that required approvals in 27 jurisdictions.

The more filings required, the higher the costs and the greater the likelihood of deal-killing time delays. Lawyers also chafe at regulator demands for sensitive information, such as business plans, that could be very useful to competitors if leaked. Plaintiff lawyers in private antitrust suits sometimes demand that regulators provide them with this information. In Europe, there is the added problem that attorney-client privilege is not as carefully observed as in the U.S.

EU regulators have acquired a reputation for revealing sensitive information while going public with their antitrust concerns. Ms. McDavid told of a visit by a client firm's executives to Mr. Monti's predecessor, Karel van Miert, who styled himself as a giant-slayer fighting the good fight for European consumers. They discovered the room full of reporters and photographers, "which wasn't exactly the way they had anticipated conducting the meeting."

"Public choice" theorists argue that it is impossible to divorce the decisions of regulatory bureaucrats from their own self-interests. They are not mere regulators of economies, they are themselves players, whose careers and future may hinge on how boldly they regulate. The EU's 50-member merger task force, by those lights, cannot be altogether regretful that it brought one of the world's largest and best-managed corporations to its knees -- although the fact that GE's stock went up and Honeywell's went down after their bombshell must have puzzled them a bit.

Quite likely, most trustbusters believe that they are doing the Lord's work. Certainly, Mr. Monti, a Yale-trained Italian academic, thinks so. Before the EU's antitrust task force came into being, Europe had a long tradition of what America's 1890 Sherman Act called "restraint of trade or commerce." It grew out of the ancient guilds formed by tradesmen to protect themselves from competition. Government-sanctioned business cartels developed after the Industrial Revolution. After World War II, socialism gripped Europe. Even in West Europe,

Page 46 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
governments nationalized some key industries and promoted "national champions" among private companies, in both cases destroying market competition.

The EU's competition authority was charged with breaking those old habits. Clearly, it has played some role in urging privatization of state-owned companies and introducing greater competition. But how much of a role is hard to say. Many state-owned corporations simply fell of their own bureaucratic weight. International free-trade agreements and the creation of the single market were the major factors in forcing European producers to become more competitive. Europe is a far more efficient market today than Japan, for example.

Whatever the successes of European pro-competition efforts, they are subject to the doubt that has always afflicted antitrust policy. Put succinctly: At what point does antitrust regulation cease to promote competition and begin to inhibit it? Or in other words, how much regulation is really needed to give consumers markets that deliver efficiency, high quality and optimum prices?

It is widely accepted, except perhaps by the most devout libertarians, that markets need some state regulation to guard against fraud and rapacity. At the very minimum, it is argued, producers should be barred from conspiring to fix prices, on grounds that to do so defeats the very principle of market competition. U.S. antitrust law reserves severe penalties for business executives found guilty of price fixing.

But trustbusters have a habit of pursuing dubious academic theories about what destroys competition. Very often they come up with the bizarre notion that the villain is competition itself! Hence Microsoft was hounded for combining a Web browser with its operating system to steal a march on competitors. In Europe, GE was accused of a nefarious plot to "bundle" products by combining Honeywell avionics with GE engines so as to offer an attractive package deal to aircraft makers.

In both Microsoft and GE-Honeywell, the main complaints came not from consumers but from competitors. Hence the quite valid question arises of whether at some point trustbusters stop serving the interests of consumers and become more intent on providing competitors with that mythical land called a "level playing field." Is it possible to do both? The antitrust regulators defend themselves by arguing that by "bundling" and other competitive tactics, companies endeavor to drive competitors out of business and ultimately to monopolize an industry themselves.

But the threat of a future monopoly is a mere theoretical construct. It might or might not happen. Maybe the merger will fail because of an internal culture clash, or maybe the colossus will become too big and slow to adapt to market changes. The immediate corporate goal is to make itself more competitive, not less. Why not wait to see what happens before getting out the sledgehammers?

Multinationals Seek Antitrust Truce --- GE-Honeywell  Deal Illustrates Complexity of Cross-Border Merger
Reviews --- Minor Changes in Requirements Could Translate Into Big Savings for Firms

BRUSSELS -- Big business has a request for  regulators trying to increase cross-border cooperation in  antitrust
enforcement: Don't let  GE-Honeywell  get in the way.

Until General Electric  Co.'s $44 billion bid for  Honeywell  International Inc. ran into trouble in  Europe, there were good prospects for increased international cooperation. Businesses wanted it,  antitrust authorities wanted it and most political leaders appeared to want it. Last fall in the U.S., the Clinton administration even endorsed the establishment of a global body, along the lines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
to improve coordination among trust busters and ultimately to vet cross-border mergers.

Now, with the European Union seemingly poised to reject a GE-Honeywell deal that was approved in the U.S., the Bush administration publicly is expressing concern about EU policies and some in Congress are threatening retaliation.

Multinational companies and their lawyers want politicians to put away their weapons. They say disagreements over antitrust policy are inevitable, and that the only way to minimize their impact is for governments to keep talking to one another, with eyes on the ultimate goal of eliminating friction between multiple, overlapping jurisdictions in merger-and-acquisition reviews.

"This case is a clarion call to the business community," says J. William Rowley, chairman of the International Bar Association's Global Forum for Competition Policy. "It's indicative of what can and increasingly will happen in a world economy where we have upwards of 70 merger-review systems and an additional two dozen coming. With different processes in place, you're going to have greater potential for divergent outcomes."

Even minor changes in merger filing requirements, approval timetables and market definitions could translate into big savings for companies doing deals, and ultimately for the customers and consumers who indirectly pick up the tab, say antitrust lawyers, bankers and corporate executives.

"Harmonizing thresholds and timetables and minimizing the number of filings would simplify the effort and the tremendous cost that merging parties have to go through now," says Barry Campbell, chief executive of the Canadian operations of public-affairs consultancy APCO Worldwide.

Heavyweight members of the International Bar Association -- including Goldman Sachs, Anglo-Australian mining concern Rio Tinto PLC, Ford Motor Co., Vodafone Group PLC and Swedish white-goods maker Electrolux AB -- are offering to help organize meetings uniting regulators and business leaders to find common ground. But they say the first step must come from governments.

"We don't have any illusions about our role in the convergence process," says Rick Sapp, head of the European mergers-and-acquisitions advisory group at Goldman Sachs in London. "This is something they have to do themselves."

The EU, for its part, doesn't need any urging. The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, repeatedly has called for greater international collaboration and has signed mutual-aid agreements with the U.S., Japan and Canada. Officials at all levels of the commission talk regularly with their counterparts at the U.S. Department of


Page 48 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Justice and Federal Trade Commission. The commission recently took aboard several ideas about antitrust remedies in merger reviews as the result of participating in a working group on the subject with the FTC.

While bilateral cooperation is a good thing, "the globalization of the economy and the increasing number of countries which have adopted some form of competition law . . . creates the need for international cooperation as well," says Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

The Bush administration has been silent on the issue as the result of the delayed confirmations of Charles James as head of the Justice Department's antitrust division and Timothy J. Muris as chairman of the FTC. Some fear an international effort that fails to win U.S. backing won't benefit business much. Says Goldman Sachs's Mr. Sapp: "You need the U.S. to participate in anything like this to make it work on a global basis."

Newscast:  Possible  survival for GE-Honeywell merger

RON INSANA, co-anchor: Officials of General Electric  and Honeywell  continue to meet to consider the possibilities for the survival of their troubled merger plans. CNBC's David Faber reported today that a Monday meeting went into detail about several options: one, that GE might try to scrap the merger agreement even before a formal ruling by antitrust officials from the European Union; two, that Honeywell  might be willing to
accept a lower price, allowing GE to make a fresh approach to  European demands for divestitures. While there is no comment from  Honeywell,  nor from GE, Democratic Senator Bob Graham of Florida did mention the European objections earlier today on "Street Signs." He is the co-sponsor of a trade bill focusing on economic
development in America, and Africa probably, and was asked if he feels Europe has the right to block the merger.

Senator BOB GRAHAM (Democrat, Florida): Just as we have had the authority to block mergers that were of essentially countries--companies that you do not think of as being US-based, the European Union has the right to exercise that same authority when they believe that it would result in a constriction of the market and would be anti-competitive, where it happens to be two US companies which do a substantial amount of business in the
European Union. So, yes, they had the right to do it. I frankly am not in a position to judge whether they were wise in exercising that authority.
INSANA: Now checking the stocks of the two gow--Dow components which were actively traded today. GE
dragged the Dow down off a buck 45. Honeywell moved up 70 cents to 36.30.

EU gains support to block GE deal

BRUSSELS -- European Union member countries have endorsed a proposal by European Commission antitrust regulators to block General Electric  Co.'s proposed acquisition of Honeywell  International Inc., people close to the situation said.

The vote yesterday by the  EU member countries was a further blow for  GE, as prospects fade for its Honeywell bid, which is currently valued at $44-billion (U.S.), based on  GE's stock price. The vote gives the Commission's merger task force a mandate to proceed to a final decision on the deal, which is likely to be taken on July 3 at a regular meeting of 20  European commissioners.

Unless GE decides to expand its earlier offer of divestitures, or withdraws the merger application, the full EC is expected to endorse the recommendation of Competition Commissioner Mario Monti to reject the deal. GE still has time to come back to the negotiating table, but the company has said that it already has made its final offer. The merger task force could theoretically tone down its objections to the deal, but that also appears unlikely.

Representatives of GE of Fairfield, Conn., and Honeywell of Morris Township, N.J., who didn't attend yesterday's meeting, declined to comment on it.

The EU member endorsement of the merger task force's position came after a debate about the merits of the case, with some EU country representatives raising questions about the Commission's antitrust analysis, people close to the situation said. Still, 13 of the 15 member nations' representatives voted in favour of the task force's proposed decision, with one country abstaining and another not present at the meeting, these people said.

GE's bid to acquire Honeywell earlier had received the green light from U.S. antitrust authorities, but ran into strong opposition from their European counterparts. Arguing that the combined company would be able to distort competition in the aerospace industry, the Commission demanded sweeping divestitures from the companies' core businesses. GE agreed to some divestitures, but the Commission dismissed the offer as insufficient.

Prior to yesterday's meeting, GE had appealed directly to the member countries to explain its viewpoint after having reached an impasse with the merger task force.
In its final proposal made June 14, GE offered to sell several Honeywell avionics units. Document glob000020010711dx6q00ugg

Brussels votes to crunch  $42bn merger.
By Andrew Osborn in Brussels.

The future of the world's biggest ever industrial takeover hung in the balance last night after European Union regulators decided that the $42bn ( #31bn) tie-up between  General Electric  and Honeywell  posed too many competition problems and should be rejected.

In a crunch vote, which sources said was `almost unanimous,' competition experts from the  EU's member states endorsed a preliminary decision by the European commission to disallow the deal on the grounds that it would allow the merged entity to compete unfairly in the lucrative multi-billion dollar market for jet engines and avionics.

The decision leaves little room for the all-American corporate marriage to be consumated. The deal has struggled from day one to win Brussels' blessing although some reports claimed that the experts wanted the commission to ask GE for further talks to try to save the deal. The final decision rests with the commission and it is expected to make a definitive ruling as early as July 3, well ahead of a self-imposed deadline of July 12.

Unless GE comes up with some serious deal-saving concessions it would now seem that the chances of the merger receiving the green light from Brussels are slim. In a recent interview GE president Jeffrey Immelt said he thought there was zero chance that the deal would be approved. An outright rejection would be certain to damage transatlantic relations since the largely American owned GE and Honeywell have solicited strong political backing for the deal from the Bush administration and secured regulatory approval from the US justice department.

A US senator wrote to the commission last week warning that a rejection would have `a chilling effect on future transatlantic aviation and aerospace cooperation.'.

Competition panel backs Brussels on GE-Honeywell  veto.

AN ADVISORY committee of European competition experts yesterday backed Mario  Monti's decision to  reject General Electric's  $41bn takeover of its US rival Honeywell,  which appears certain to be blocked officially by Brussels early next month.

Reports that the committee had split and called on the commission to re-enter talks with  GE sent Honeywell's stock up in early New York trading, as hopes grew that the merger could be revived. These reports were later dismissed by sources close to the  Commission, who said that the  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, had been backed by the committee, with only one small country abstaining.

The advisory committee, which is made up of representatives from the competition agencies of member states, reviews conclusions made by the European Commission on big merger deals, although its recommendations are not binding on the Commission.

GE representatives were not involved in the meeting, although they have met with some competition officials in EU capitals in recent days to explain and defend their proposed concessions, GE's spokeswoman Louise Binns said.

The EU's hard line on the GE-Honeywell tie-up, which won conditional US clearance last month, has provoked criticism from the Bush administration and Congress.

A US senator, Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, sent a letter last week to the Commission to urge a fair decision and warn that a rejection "could have a chilling effect on future transatlantic aviation and aerospace cooperation".
Mr Monti responded that the decision would not be swayed by attempts at "political intervention".
In its last attempt to meet EU objections, GE said that it had offered to divest Honeywell units with $2.2bn
(#1.6bn) in annual sales but that the Commission demanded billions more.

But Mr Monti said GE could have kept some of the Honeywell units it was offering to sell if it had agreed to "a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior of" GE's aircraft leasing unit, GE Capital Aviation Services.

The merger task force could theoretically tone down its objections to the deal, but that appears unlikely.

Representatives of GE, in Fairfield, Conn., and Honeywell, in Morris Township, N.J., who didn't attend yesterday's meeting, declined to comment on it.

The EU member endorsement of the merger task force's position came after a debate about the merits of the case, with some EU country representatives raising questions about the commission's antitrust analysis, people close to the situation said. Still, 13 of the 15 member nations' representatives voted in favor of the task force's proposed decision, with one country abstaining and another not present at the meeting, these people said.

GE's bid to acquire Honeywell received the green light from U.S. antitrust authorities, but ran into strong opposition from their European counterparts. Arguing that the combined company would be able to distort competition in the aerospace industry, the commission demanded sweeping divestitures from the companies' core businesses. GE agreed to some divestitures, but the commission dismissed the offer as insufficient.

In its final proposal made June 14, GE offered to sell several Honeywell avionics units with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion and to introduce separate management for GE Capital Aviation Services, or Gecas, the company's powerful aircraft financing and leasing arm. The commission accuses Gecas, a large purchaser of aircraft, of promoting GE's equipment to the detriment of competitors, and it continues to seek a remedy that would render such promotion more difficult.

The commission has asked GE to either sell more of Honeywell's core avionics businesses or come up with a more far-reaching remedy to separate Gecas. GE has balked at demands for greater divestitures from Honeywell and also has rejected any measures that would leave it with less than 100% ownership of Gecas.

Prior to yesterday's meeting, GE had appealed directly to the member countries to explain its viewpoint after having reached an impasse with the merger task force.

Monti satisfied with EU panel view on GE deal.

BRUSSELS, June 26 (Reuters) - European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said on Tuesday he was "entirely satisfied" with a European Union advisory panel's decision to back a draft Commission decision to block General Electric  Co's planned merger with Honeywell  International Inc. .
"I am entirely satisfied for the almost unanimous support given yesterday by the advisory panel to the...decision,"
Monti told reporters.

Sources told Reuters after the panel met on Monday that it voted to back a draft European Commission decision to block the deal on competition grounds, but may also have have left the door open to further talks with the companies. The EU executive is expected to make a final ruling on the deal on July 3.

The negotiations over GE-Honeywell have strained ties between Brussels and Washington, which has already cleared the deal. Monti said it was of utmost importance that relations remained on an even keel.
"Bilateral cooperation between the United States and the European Union is of utmost importance," Monti said. If differences on competition policy emerge, both sides should "analyse in a cool and professional way the
reasons for such divergences and see if they can be avoided in the future", he added.

EU advisory committee studying GE-Honeywell

Antitrust officials from the 15  European Union nations took up the draft decision of  merger regulators on General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. yesterday. The deal is widely expected to be formally  rejected next week.

The advisory committee, made up of representatives from national competition agencies, reviews conclusions made by the EuropeanCommission, the EU's executive body, on big merger deals and makes recommendations.
No further meetings were expected after yesterday's session.

An unidentified EU source told Dow Jones Newswires that the advisory committee members were "almost unanimous" in supporting the Commission's proposed rejection of the deal.

If true, that would make it unlikely that the commission would change its position when the merger comes up for a vote, which is expected July 3.
GE President Jeffrey Immelt said last week he saw "zero" chance the deal would be approved.

GE representatives were not involved, although they have met with some competition officials in EU capitals in recent days to explain and defend their proposed concessions, the company said.

Enforcement of antitrust law is one of the few areas in the EU where the Commission is empowered to act on its own. Its decisions can be challenged in court, but companies usually abandon their deal long before any ruling can be made.

The EU's hard line on the GE-Honeywell tie-up, which won conditional U.S. clearance last month, has provoked criticism from Washington. Honeywell is based in Morris Township.

Crying foul on the question of trust and anti-trust.

WHEN the European Commission indicated it was likely to block the proposed  merger between General           Electric (GE) and Honeywell,  American politicians from President George W. Bush on down cried foul, with
some alleging that the decision was politically motivated.

They are almost certainly wrong about that, but it is true that the  commission's case against the  merger is far from watertight. Mr Mario  Monti, Europe's competition referee, may have made a bad call on this play.

Nonetheless, US politicians should lower their voices. Mr Monti is one of the good guys in today's global economy. He should not be made the target of attempts at political intimidation.

To put the GE-Honeywell affair in context, you need to realise that this case is a triple switcheroo: It contradicts not one but three pieces of conventional wisdom.

First, the conventional view is that globalisation weakens governments, because it forces them to compete for private investment. Broadly speaking, this view is right. (Conventional wisdom usually is.)

There are, however, exceptions to the rule, and anti-trust policy is one of those exceptions. In today's world, no company can compete effectively unless it can operate freely on both sides of the Atlantic - which it can do only with a green light from anti-trust authorities in both the US and Europe.

The result is that instead of eroding the power of those authorities, globalisation has extended their reach: American regulators can block European mergers, and vice versa.

Second, this case inverts traditional roles. Until recently, only the US seemed to take anti-trust policy seriously. Europeans might have US-style legislation on the books, but they often seemed to feel that cartels, like extramarital affairs, were nothing to worry about as long as the participants were discreet - and they were scornful towards puritanical Americans who insisted on enforcing the letter of the law.

Lately, however, Europe has become serious about anti-trust, giving the competition commissioner broad powers to block mergers and investigate allegations of anti-competitive behaviour.

Mr Monti, an American-trained university professor who assumed that office in 1999, has used those powers aggressively. GE and Honeywell are not the first companies to find him blocking what they thought was a done deal.

Was he right to block this particular deal? It's a complicated issue. Let's just say that the case against this merger is similar to the case for breaking up Microsoft, though it seems a lot weaker. On the other hand, you do not need as strong an argument to block a merger as you do to break up a going concern. We are in a grey area, with the precise shade of grey a matter of opinion.

Even if you disagree with Mr Monti's opinion, however, his sincerity is not in doubt. The best answer to those who claim that this is really a protectionist ploy is his track record: He has repeatedly shown himself willing to oppose the demands of powerful European interest groups. Why would he suddenly become a tool of protectionists?

And that leads us to the third switcheroo. Europeans are accustomed to cosy cohabitation between politicians and businessmen; Americans tend to insist on at least the appearance of an arm's-length relationship.



Page 60 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But just at the moment when the Europeans have placed competition policy in the hands of a sternly-upright professor, the US has acquired an administration that seems oblivious to normal concerns about conflict of interest.

It is not yet clear whether the Bush administration really is a government of, by and for big corporations to an extent not seen since Mr Warren Harding was president, or whether it just looks that way. But the stories keep accumulating.

Intel's chief lobbyist says that his highly inappropriate meetings with Mr Bush's chief political adviser Karl Rove were 'quite useful' to its merger case - and Mr Rove did not even get a slap on the wrist.

According to the outgoing chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the head of Enron offered to support him at the White House if he changed his policy positions.

And it took three months - and a sharp prod from Mr Jake Tapper at Salon - before Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill honoured his promise to sell his Alcoa stock. As a consumer, I am not sure I trust these people to protect me from the market power of giant corporations.
And so it is nice to know that Mr Monti is out there, looking after my interests.

General Electric's  proposed $42 billion ( #29 billion)  merger with Honeywell,  its smaller rival, received another set back last night when a key  European Union advisory committee voted in Brussels to  reject the deal.

Competition regulators from 14 of the 15 EU member states voted twice yesterday, ultimately supporting the recommendation of the European Commission's expert merger taskforce to  reject the GE bid on competition grounds.

However, the merger parties were offered some hope when some sources said that the final vote included conditions that require the commission to restart negotiations with GE. The deadline for the EU decision is July
12.

WSJ: GE, Honeywell  Make 11th Hour Push For Merger

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- General Electric  Co. (GE) and Honeywell  International Inc. (HON) made an
11th-hour push for their proposed $42 billion merger in talks with European regulatory officials in Brussels,
informally offering to sell a minority stake of GE's aviation financing unit to non-competitors in exchange for fewer
divestitures of  Honeywell's  avionics businesses, people familiar with the situation told The Wall Street Journal.

On its surface, the proposal was crafted to appease some of the  commission's expressed concerns about  GE Capital Aviation Services, the aircraft-finance unit and large purchaser of aircraft that the  commission claims unfairly pressures manufacturers to buy  GE products, these people said.

In earlier negotiations, the commission had raised the prospect of publicly floating a piece of the unit, or even of giving a stake to competitors, ideas at which GE balked. The new proposal, which was presented during meetings between GE and Honeywell lawyers and commission staffers in Brussels, would fall short of a public flotation or
of including GE competitors as stakeholders, these people noted. Likely holders of the stake might include financial investors, as an example, these people said.

In addition, the Gecas board would add outside directors proportionate to the stake, they said. The revised GE offer also would be contingent on fewer divestitures of Honeywell avionics businesses than the ones GE previously had proposed selling off, which had combined sales of about $2.2 billion, these people said.

While odds of reaching an agreement seemed improved by the very fact that discussions were taking place, the chance of finding a compromise that satisfied all players still seemed slim, said people familiar with the situation.
(This report and related background will be available at the Journal's Web site, WSJ.com.)

While hopeful Honeywell executives are pushing the settlement, GE, which termed its package of concessions two weeks ago its "final offer," is more pessimistic that the proposal will fully addresses commission objections, these people said. Still, the new offer does represent substantial movement by GE from the offer it termed "final" two weeks ago, in which it proposed keeping Gecas at arm's length from the avionics products it would acquire with Honeywell, but rejected the notion of spinning off any piece of Gecas. Both GE and the commission acknowledged that was far less than the commission wanted.

A GE spokesman said, "Our outside European advisers have had informal discussions with commission staff on options that are within the financial parameters of GE's June 14 proposal," referring to the package of
concessions GE presented to the EU on that date. But he declined comment on the substance of the discussions.
A Honeywell spokesman also declined comment, as did a commission spokesman.

AVIONICS - EU COMMITTEE BACKS COMMISSION OVER GE-HONEYWELL DECISION.
943 words
27 June 2001
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2001 European Report.
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti revealed on June 26 that the  EU's advisory committee on mergers, made up of representatives of the Member States, had given its support to the  European Commission's stance on the merger between US companies  General Electric  (GE) and Honeywell.  The announcement was made in a speech given at a competition conference organised by the American Chamber of Commerce on Brussels. The decision by the committee means that when the  Commission meets on July 3, it is very likely to back Mr Monti in his decision to block the  merger between the two American businesses. This will be the 14th occasion on which the Commission will have blocked a merger in the 12-year existence of its  Merger Taskforce. Mr Monti also revealed that he was working hard with the  competition authorities in the US to ensure that his decision will not cause a political backlash on the other side of the Atlantic.

"There was near unanimous support from the committee to support the Commission's decision," said Mr Monti. "The deadline for the investigation is July 12 and we are scheduled to discuss the decision at the Commission meeting of July 3. Such a difference of opinion means that we (the EU and US competition authorities) must learn to manage at a technical level our differences and avoid such decisions becoming a political dispute. We must also analyse our decisions so that this difference in opinions does not happen in the future." Mr Monti defended the likely outcome of the merger procedure by saying that there were times when the US authorities had dealt
with mergers more harshly than the Commission and vice versa."Following the decision to block the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas deal in 1998 there were predictions that there would be a breakdown in the relationship between the Commission and the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Committee. That prediction did not happen. Both authorities realise it is in the interests of business and profit-making to continue to support our lines of thinking on mergers. There are cases where the Commission took a less tough line than the US ie AOL-Time Warner. The Commission approved the deal before the Federal Trade Committee and with less remedies. Of course, one could say what of EMI-Time Warner, but the FTC had similar concerns to the Commission. Many observers wanted to see what would happen if Bertelsmann showed an interest in EMI. This did happen, but the two companies abandoned the deal partly because of the concerns the Commission had expressed," said Mr Monti.Prior to Mr Monti's announcement the Commission was tight-lipped over whether it would block the GE and Honeywell merger. "The issue can still be examined until July 12. There is a strict timetable to inquiries into mergers and Mr Monti will make his findings clear to the College of Commissioners before that date," said Amelia Torres, Competition spokeswoman for the Commission.

Reports recently suggested that the deal between GE and Honeywell is likely to be blocked by the Commission as it believes the combined company will dominate certain parts of the avionics sector. It is understood that the Commission is particularly concerned about how General Electric Capital Aviation Services (Gecas), GE's airplane leasing company, would operate with Honeywell's businesses. GE has offered to "ring fence" Gecas, but
this does not go far enough for the Commission. It has asked for more divestments, something GE has refused to do.US politicians angry

Two senior Democrat senators have expressed anger at the Commission's likely blocking of the GE-Honeywell deal, which was cleared by US competition authorities in May. Senator Ernest Hollings, who is Chairman of the US Senate Commerce Committee, said in a letter sent to Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy on June 22 that he was "troubled" by the Commission's position on the deal. He also suggested that trade relations between the EU and the US could be further strained by a decision that went against the merger. Another senior senator Jay Rockefeller, who also sits on the Commerce Committee, threatened in a letter to Commission Vice-President Loyala de Palacio, on June 20, possible retaliatory action against the European avionics industry by the US if the merger was rejected.Appeals processThe proposed merger and the ensuing inquiry has led to a growing number of calls by legal representatives for a change in way possible appeals are dealt with (see previous edition of European Report). At the moment once the Commission has taken a decision companies can either accept it or face a lengthy process to try and prove a deal was wrongly analysed by the Merger Taskforce. "There is a need

Page 67 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
for some kind of faster appeal mechanism," said Olivier Kaiser, co-chair of competition sub-committee of the EU Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce. "I believe competition practitioners and many big companies would welcome an appeal process.However, the increase in workload for the appeal body, possibly the Court of First Instance as has been suggested by other competition experts would not hugely increase. "In total the Commission has only blocked 13 mergers in the 12 years the Competition Directorate-General has been in existence, but usually they are the headline grabbing ones," said Kaiser. "However, that figure doesn't take into account the mergers that have been withdrawn. Another issue about the current structure of enquiries is that companies may make more commitments to the Commission, to get a deal cleared, than they might do if there was an appeals process."

Monti steps closer to killing GE merger:  Nobody votes yes: 'I'm satisfied with almost entirely  unanimous
support'

BRUSSELS - Mario  Monti, the European competition commissioner, said yesterday he is closer to blocking General Electric  Co.'s US$44-billion takeover of Honeywell  International Inc. after winning the support of antitrust officials.
"I'm entirely satisfied with the almost unanimous support for our draft prohibition decision," Mr.  Monti said.
No countries appealed to save the merger and only one abstained at Monday's meeting of officials from the 15
European Union governments, said his spokeswoman, Amelia Torres.

General Electric, the world's largest company by market value, could seek to salvage the transaction by making a new proposal to scale back its aerospace business, although the company said two weeks ago it won't put more concessions on the table.

"They would have to come back with some fairly clear new commitments that dealt with the competition concerns," said Jane Golding, an antitrust lawyer at Taylor Joynson Garrett. "One doesn't get the feeling they will be coming back."

In what it called its final offer on June 14, General Electric said it would sell businesses with US$2.2-billion in revenue and separate the accounts of its plane-leasing unit to allay concern it would dominate the markets for jet engines and airplane electronics.

Asked at an American Chamber of Commerce luncheon yesterday if General Electric can make further concessions, Mr. Monti said: "There are very precise and tight rules governing consideration of remedies submitted after the deadline of June 14." He declined to elaborate.

Jeff Immelt, GE's president and chairman-elect, told France's Le Monde last week that there are "zero" chances of European clearance.
The European Commission plans to announce its decision on July 3, although the legal deadline for a ruling is
July 12.

Louise Binns, a GE spokeswoman, had no comment on yesterday's meeting. "We remain fully committed to the offer," she said.
Honeywell spokesman Thomas Crane declined to comment.

Rejection would be the first time the EU has acted alone to halt a U.S. takeover. The EU can block or force changes to mergers between companies with combined global sales of 5 billion euros ($6.54-billion), even if they are not based in Europe.
It is not unusual for the commission to fail to get unanimous backing from the national antitrust advisors.

Published opinions show it met with dissent when it approved BP Amoco PLC's purchase of Atlantic Richfield Co. in September, 1999, blocked Airtours PLC's purchase of First Choice Holidays PLC the same month, and approved TotalFina SA's purchase of Elf Aquitaine SA in February, 2000.

General Electric's last chance to save the merger on its own terms would be in lobbying the other 19 commissioners to overrule Mr. Monti.

Political pressure is also coming from U.S. Senators in open letters to their European counterparts. However, the commission rejected Senators' charges yesterday that its objections were driven by a desire to protect European aerospace competitors from strengthened U.S. competition.

EC hopes GE flap won't spoil relations

BRUSSELS -- Europe's anti-monopoly chief said Tuesday that the decision to block the proposed  merger between General Electric  and Honeywell  should not signal a breach of U.S.-European relations in the critical area of antitrust law.

Mario Monti, in a speech and in a letter responding to U.S. criticism, predicted increased cooperation between the European Commission and U.S. antitrust officials. Although the two authorities sometimes take different paths, they both want increased competition to benefit consumers, he said.

When there are differences, "We must learn to manage them at the technical level and avoid that they escalate into political disputes," he told an American Chamber of Commerce luncheon here.
President Bush and his top economic aides have blasted Monti's competition agency for rejecting the
GE-Honeywell deal. The $41 billion merger was cleared by U.S. regulators. But the EC is saying no. The merger
would give GE too much leverage, especially in the jet engine business, according to a draft ruling prepared by
the commission staff. With manufacturing, leasing and credit all under one umbrella, deals could be offered that
no competitor could match, it said.
The commission asked GE to restructure its credit branch so that couldn't happen, but GE refused.

In a letter released Tuesday, Monti and the EC's transport chief, Loyola de Palacio, called unfounded a charge by Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate aviation subcommittee, that they were trying to protect Europe's aerospace industry from strong U.S. competition. The EC operates on "the fundamental principle of non- discrimination," they said.
The EC has until July 12 to rule on the GE-Honeywell request. But an EU advisory panel on Monday endorsed
Monti's position, clearing the way for a final decision at the agency's meeting next Tuesday.

A European Union committee has come out against a proposed US$45 billion  merger between US giant
General Electric  and Honeywell.

A source close to the committee on mergers and acquisitions said all but one of the committee members supported the stance taken by  EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.
GE has said it expects Mr Monti to veto the merger.

The veto should be finalised on July 3 when the European Commission, the EU's competition watchdog, holds its next formal meeting.

GE, the world's biggest conglomerate, with interests ranging from aerospace to finance and media, announced its plans to purchase Honeywell last October and unify the two companies' aerospace activities.
US officials have already approved the deal. Document cnewas0020010711dx6r005mc

DEBORAH MARCHINI, CNNfn ANCHOR, OF COURSE: GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/) and Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) : The European Commission is supposed to make a final decision about whether they can merge July 2. The betting is the deal will be off.
Lionel Barber of the "Financial Times" joins me now to talk about more the  GE-Honeywell merger. And Lionel, is it a done deal already? Or an undone deal already?
LIONEL BARBER, "FINANCIAL TIMES": Well, I think it`s an undone deal, actually.

I think there were a lot of interesting rumors yesterday, which were picking up in meetings between GE and Honeywell, possibly looking at a revised offer. Other sources were saying that although this is Jack Welch`s deal, he`s actually spending more time on his book.

But actually, I think the action is really now focused in Brussels, where Mario Monti, the Italian commissioner responsible for anti-trust policy has received this week`s solid backing from the 15-member states, saying he was right to block this deal. And yes, two or three countries expressed some reservations, but this was more in sorrow than anguish that they haven`t been able to come to a deal.

And my inside information is that Mr. Monti has very, very solid support inside the 20-strong European Commission behind his stance for blocking this deal. And there isn`t anymore time, really, for GE to come back, as we explain in today`s "Financial Times" lexicon.
MARCHINI: Thank you so much, Lionel Barber of the "FT."

Tough Call: Too Much Power for the EU?

RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: European antitrustregulators mulling over the G.E. (URL: http://www.ge.com/) - Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) merger. They are set to make a final decision next week. It is widely expected the $41 billion deal will be formally rejected when the EU votes on this merger, July 3. Despite that, G.E. and  Honeywell  are still discussing ways to save the deal. The fact that European regulators could block such a big deal between two U.S. companies has many people here upset, including politicians on Capitol Hill.
Last week, Senator Phil Gramm expressed his concerns during a Senate hearing, on banking. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. PHIL GRAMM (R) TEXAS: My concern is that we don`t end up having bad policies imposed on us, as Europeans try to protect themselves against competition, when they`ve lost competitive edge based on their policies that they`ve implemented.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

SCHAFFLER: So, is the EU`s possible rejection of the G.E.-Honeywell merger a way for Europe to stifle competition? In just a few moments, we`re going to talk to an antitrust attorney about that. First though, we are joined by Senator Gramm. Senator, thanks very much for joining us here on MARKET CALL.
SEN. PHIL GRAMM (R) TEXAS: Thank you, Rhonda.

SCHAFFLER: This is a merger that people continue to talk about. It`s one that has you particularly troubled. What are the implications, if the deal is formally rejected?

GRAMM: Well, first of all, I think any time you have two companies that are predominantly American companies, even in a global context, it`s got to concern you a little when a regulator in Europe can deny two companies, domiciled in America, the right to merge. I think, secondly, I`m not saying, in this individual case, that there`s an anti- competitive angle-- but I am saying that Europe has adopted a privacy provision which is unworkable; they have adopted environmental standards, and other standards in the functioning of their economy, that have made them less competitive.

And I`m concerned, as we increasingly globalize the economy-- which I`m in favor of-- that unless we can harmonize these regulatory decisions, there will be an incentive in Europe, and other places that have made themselves less competitive, to try to impose their inefficient standards on us. So I`m concerned about this. I think you`ve got to be concerned. And it`s a just special kind of circumstance.

General Electric is not your ordinary company. If you were looking at the long commercial history of America, you might make a case that General Electric is the greatest American company.
SCHAFFLER: Senator Gramm, what, at this point, can the U.S. do -- perhaps nothing, to save this particular deal
-- but what can the U.S. do, going forward?

GRAMM: First of all, I`m not contemplating or threatening in any way, that we`re going to get Congress involved in this. I`ve simply expressed a concern that our regulators have looked at this merger. They have not found it to be anti-competitive from the point of view of the interests of the consumer. European regulation tends to be based on the interests of other competitors. That`s fundamentally different than us.


Page 74 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Our view is, if the merger does not hurt consumers, that people have a right to merge. The European view tends to be more: if it doesn`t hurt other competitors. Well, we`re not worried about other competitors--we`re worried about consumers. So, at some point, somewhere, as we increasingly have a one-world economy, we`ve got to come up with more uniform standards, and I think this is just a leading edge of a growing concern that I think we`d be very foolish not to be concerned.

SCHAFFLER: Senator, what about the argument that Europe should have the right to regulate business within its borders? -- G.E. could make concessions.

GRAMM: Well, I think both of these companies are big-time employers in Europe. They`re big-time economic players. Nobody is denying that Europe should not be involved in the process. But I come back to the point I made originally, and that is, when you`re dealing with two American companies -- granted, they`re engaged in international commerce, as major companies are all over the world -- but when you`ve got two American companies -- our regulators decide that the merger should go forward -- to have that overridden and stopped by regulators on another continent, is something you`ve got to be concerned about. Is it right? Is it wrong? I mean, you make arguments either way. But is it something that should give us a little pause? Yeah, I think so.
SCHAFFLER: Senator Gramm, thank you so much for joining us on MARKET CALL. GRAMM: Thank you.
SCHAFFLER: Appreciate it. And now we are joined now by technology antitrust attorney, Glenn Manishin. Glenn, you`ve heard the concerns of Senator Gramm. Let`s ask your opinion on this issue.

GLENN B. MANISHIN, TECH. ANTITRUST ATTORNEY: Well, I`ve got to commend Senator Gramm for not trying to politicize the antitrust enforcement process. He made two good points. The first is, that if there`s an American company doing business abroad, that the Europeans have the right to impose their rules. It`s almost if you might say, when you go in to play in someone else`s ballpark, that you need to obey their ground rules.

On the other hand, Commissioner Monti, who is the European commissioner in charge of their antitrust enforcement, called last spring for a global competition forum, to address precisely the kinds of harmonization and universal implementation of antitrust rules, that Senator Gramm was talking about.

So it`s not a question of-- do they have the power to come to a difference of opinion, on a particular merger. Rather, it`s a question of--in a global economy is there going to be a single unified source for dealing with competition policy, or will it be, to coin a term, "balkanized" among many nations: the U.S., the European Union, or other states, where global companies want to do business.
SCHAFFLER: Glenn, do you think that`s the route we should take?

MANISHIN: I believe that there is a vast bulk of common shared values between the European Union and America, on antitrust. The vast bulk of mergers of both sides reached the same conclusion. AOL Time Warner (URL: http://www.aol.com/) was one, and there`s many others that have come down the pike.

On the margins, we will differ-- but at the same time, there needs to be improved coordination among the regulatory agencies, and perhaps-- this would be the political hard question: should there be a WTO, a multilateral treaty, among all industrialized countries, trying to harmonize competition policy? That`s a tougher political question.

SCHAFFLER: And when we talk politics, it gets even more difficult because it`s hard to imagine that there would be some sort of unanimous agreement. You mentioned AOL Time Warner -- AOL`s the parent of this network. That was also a deal this went through some struggles, and it`s not that this is the first time we`ve had trouble in Europe as far as getting some of these deals, done. The question is, though, if everyone agrees competition is good -- it creates jobs; it`s better for everyone`s economy -- why haven`t we gotten to the point where we`ve got something in place, already?

MANISHIN: Well, mergers are a different situation here. Not looking back at what`s happened in the past, you`re looking forward and you`re making a prediction of how the combination of two large-scale, dominant economic enterprises, will affect competition in the future. And in the U.S., as in in the EU, policy analysts will differ on that predicted value. But, as I said, the vast bulk of instances is no different between what happens in the European Union and what happens in America. The statistics, or the number of mergers that each side investigates or blocks, are virtually identical. They`re a very small fraction of most economic activity.

EU'S MONTI SWEARS HE'S FAIR

EU UNDER FIRE

EU competition czar Mario Monti fired back at a U.S. Senator yesterday - proclaiming his concerns about the
European Union's handling of the  General Electric-Honeywell merger were "wholly unfounded."

In a letter to Sen. John Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), Monti and his transport commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, said the commission's objections to the deal were not based on any "novel or unusual" legal theory.

Monti and his colleague were responding to a recent letter from Rockefeller in which he said the U.S. may retaliate if the EU rejected GE's $42 billion bid for Honeywell.

"We would like to reassure you that the concerns to which you refer about the operation of the European Union's merger control rules are wholly unfounded," Monti and Palacio asserted in their letter.
"Our competition policy . . . is firmly based on the fundamental principle of non-discrimination."

Monti went on to say political considerations played no role in the commission's review - despite the onslaught of criticism from a band of U.S. lawmakers.

"Recent attempts to politicize the Commission's review process are consequently entirely misplaced," the letter said.

In an attempt to prove the EU's intentions are not anti-American, Monti pointed out that of 394 mergers involving at least one U.S. company reviewed by the commission since September 1990, 338 had been approved without concessions. Only 16 deals had been called off or withdrawn, he noted.

GE held informal talks with European Commission on Honeywell  deal

(Copyright 2001)
NEW YORK, June 27 (AFP) -  General Electric  Co. said Wednesday its advisors held informal discussions with
European Commission staff earlier in the day on the company's proposed  merger with Honeywell  International.

The talks attempted to "explore options or ideas that are within the financial parameters of our June 14 proposal," said spokesman Gary Scheffer.

He declined to comment on a Financial Times report that GE has made a new offer in an effort to gain European approval for the deal merging the two industrial conglomerates.

The newspaper said details of the new offer are not clear but are believed to include the sale of a minority stake in GECAS, GE's aircraft leasing unit, whose strong market position is the European Commission's main concern in reviewing the deal.

On June 14, GE said it was prepared to "ring-fence" GECAS from the rest of the group's aerospace businesses in order to ease European competition concerns.

The Commission has been widely expected to announce that it is blocking the GE-Honeywell deal, after GE's refusal to make all the concessions demanded by Brussels.

Monti Seeks to Avoid Antitrust Disputes  Between U.S., EU --- Competition Commission Sees Little Hope
for GE-Honeywell
By Brandon Mitchener
Staff Reporter
498 words
27 June 2001
The Wall Street Journal Europe

BRUSSELS -- European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti promised a "special effort" to understand
why European Union and U.S. antitrust authorities reached different views in the merger proposal of General   
Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. but stopped short of suggesting a magic solution.

Speaking to a conference of international  antitrust lawyers, Mr. Monti said in cases where U.S. and  EU authorities don't agree about a deal, "a very special effort should be made to analyze in a cool and professional way the reasons for such a divergence and see if they could be avoided in the future." He added, "I'm not an expert in repair work -- I try to avoid the damage in the first place."

Mr. Monti held out little prospect that the commission would reverse its draft decision to block GE's $43 billion (49.98 billion euros) bid to acquire Honeywell, unless the companies coughed up remedies to the commission's concerns quickly.

Mr. Monti welcomed the "almost unanimous support" that antitrust officials from individual EU member states gave the commission on Monday, and noted that the remedies to the commission's concerns were already past due.
GE has said its June 14 proposal remains its final offer. The commission dismissed it as insufficient.

Still, the companies in theory could still avoid the deal being blocked, either by submitting remedies that the commission has already indicted would address its concerns or by scrapping the acquisition agreement and robbing the commission of the basis on which to issue a judgement. The commission is expected to formally rule on the deal next Tuesday.

In his speech, Mr. Monti emphasized that despite the tension surrounding the GE-Honeywell deal -- approved in the U.S. but on the rocks in Europe -- U.S.-EU antitrust cooperation has been close and "remarkably pragmatic" and "has worked particularly well in merger cases" in the recent past.

He cited a number of cases, including America Online Inc.'s merger with Time Warner Inc. and WorldCom Inc.'s failed merger with Sprint Corp. as examples of cases in which the EU and the U.S. had worked closely together without any friction. Both authorities cleared the first deal and both quashed the second deal. (WorldCom is appealing the commission decision.)

When disputes arise, "we must be able to manage them at the technical level and to avoid escalating to political disputes," Mr. Monti said.

After listening to the speech, Theodore Ullyot, vice president and associate general counsel of AOL Time Warner Inc, said he supported greater U.S.-EU antitrust cooperation but added it was "unrealistic" to expect every company's experience with antitrust authorities to be as positive as that of AOL Time Warner. "Merger reviews
are inherently speculative," he said. "I don't think cooperation necessarily entails subsequent agreement on a merger."

EU official isn't encouraging about GE-Honeywell  deal; He won't say whether merger could be saved

Providing little hope that General Electric  Co. can rescue its proposed $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell International Inc., the European Union antitrust chief sought Tuesday to smooth trans-Atlantic waves. He said he was confident that differences with his U.S. counterparts would remain rare.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti avoided directly answering a question about whether there was still time for GE to satisfy EU objections to the deal, which is stalled here, although it received conditional clearance from U.S. and Canadian  regulators.

Monti noted that the European Commission is to make its decision next Tuesday and pointed out the "very precise and tight rules governing deadlines" for submitting proposals to meet regulators' concerns. That deadline passed for GE on June 14.

He also said that he welcomed the solid backing that commission findings on the case received Monday at a meeting of EU national competition officials, who had been the targets of last-minute GE lobbying.

"I am entirely satisfied with the almost-unanimous support of the advisory committee," he said after a speech to competition attorneys.

Monti's spokeswoman, Amelia Torres, said the 15 national competition authorities "fully backed the commission's analysis in this merger, with the exception of one country, which abstained."

Support from EU governments would strengthen Monti's hand in recommending a rejection of the GE-Honeywell merger to his colleagues on the 20-member commission, the executive branch of the EU.
GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said GE and Honeywell executives met Monday.
"We remain fully committed to our final proposal," Sheffer said. "We continue to have discussions concerning it." Sheffer would not comment further on the meeting. Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane would not confirm the
meeting and said he would not comment on "speculation."

EU sources have expressed surprise that GE and Honeywell have not withdrawn the deal and are sticking by what they called their "final offer," which is almost certain to be rejected.
Crane said the merger agreement did not call for breakup fees should either company back out of the deal. GE had sought to overcome EU objections by offering to divest Honeywell units totaling $2.2 billion in yearly
sales, but company officials have said that the commission was demanding billions more.

Monti said last week, however, that the commission was more interesting in securing "a structural commitment" regarding the financial and leasing arm of GE, GE Capital Aviation Services, one of the leading purchasers of aircraft in the world.

The commission has cited concerns that bundling GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and GE Capital Aviation financing would give the combined company enough market power to drive competitors out of business, resulting in higher prices.

GE offered to put some space between itself and its unit, but apparently not enough to satisfy EU concerns.

Analysis: General Electric  offers to sell small stake in leasing business in exchange for European Union commission approving its merger with Honeywell

SUE HERERA, co-anchor: It's not over yet. General Electric  is still talking with European regulators in an
11th-hour push to get its proposed $42 billion merger with Honeywell  approved.  Joining us with more on the
late-breaking developments is The Wall Street Journal's finance editor, Steve Lipin.
Good to see you, Steve.
Mr. STEVE LIPIN (Finance Editor, The Wall Street Journal): Hi, Sue. HERERA: OK, so tell us exactly what's been breaking...
Mr. LIPIN: OK.
HERERA: ...and what the latest is.

Mr. LIPIN: Basically, on an informal basis, GE has offered to sell a minority stake in its leasing business, GECAS. Now the EU has been pushing for a separate, independent GECAS, and what GE has offered is `We will sell a stake, not to the public'--which is what the EU wants--`but to a minority group, a group of financial investors.' So sell a stake so that it's not completely owned by GE. However, in exchange for that, they want to take back some of the divestitures that they had offered from Honeywell.
HERERA: Right.
Mr. LIPIN: So it's a give and a take, and it does put the ball a little bit back in the court of the--of the EU right now. HERERA: Yeah. You know, is it enough, though, do you think, Steve?
Mr. LIPIN: Well, it's--it's not a significant step but it is a step. And so depending on how much pressure Commissioner Monti's under to cut a deal, there may be a way for him to try to suggest that perhaps--you know, he could say that they got some form of independence from GECAS, and at same time GE could say that it didn't give a lot. In the end, this is not a significant move on the part of GE.
HERERA: All right. Steve, thank you very much. Mr. LIPIN: Sure.
HERERA I have a funny feeling we'll be talking to you about this again soon. Mr. LIPIN: Yeah, this is as long as Francisco Franco dying.
RON INSANA (Co-anchor): Oh, my word.
HERERA: On that note, Steve Lipin of The Wall Street Journal, thank you.
And, Ron, a lot of people also think that the European Commission might move a little bit on this... INSANA: Yeah.
HERERA: ...in some way, shape or form, because the trade tensions have been increasing so dramatically between the US; witness the--the letter earlier this week from Senator Rockefeller.
INSANA: Yeah, and today, you know, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill made the first direct comment... HERERA: Exactly.
Page 84 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
INSANA: ...from the highest reaches of the US government about this. He said it was "off the wall," to quote the
Treasury secretary.
HERERA: And he's a plain-speaking man.

INSANA: He--yeah--off the wall, that they would turn down the deal. So that's a very interesting development here, I think.
HERERA: It's sure is.

All right. Let's join Carl Quintanilla and Michelle Caruso-Cabrera; they're at CNBC world headquarters. What's up on Market Drivers tonight, guys?

CARL QUINTANILLA (The Wall Street Journal): Hey, Sue. Well, you know, it might be off the wall, but the volume on GE and Honeywell tonight is off the chart. We'll tell you what both stocks have done after the bell.

MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA (CNBC): Especially for listed companies. And we have a chip company that actually has good news; it's moving higher. We'll have that when we come back. Ron, Sue.
INSANA: All right. Thank you.

Continuing coverage of today's Federal Reserve rate cut, we will go in-depth with market insiders on how the cut played out on Wall Street and how it might affect investors down the road.

Interview: Marcus Brauchli of The Wall Street Journal  on new attempt by GE to gain European approval  of its Honeywell merger proposal

TED DAVID, co-anchor: Oh, I love it. Times Square, New York City, USA, Western Hemisphere, the world. Did I
locate that for you well? OK.

Top story in tomorrow morning's Wall Street Journal: a report that talks are on between GE and the EU. General Electric,  parent company of this network, has made another last-minute attempt to win approval  from the European Union for its proposed takeover of  Honeywell.  Let's go live to The Journal's newsroom right now and get the latest from national editor Marcus Brauchli.
Marcus, 11th hour's becoming 11:30. It's pushing 11:55 here. What's going on?

Mr. MARCUS BRAUCHLI (The Wall Street Journal): I think this must be GE's final, final offer. On June 14th, they said it was their final offer. It looks like GE and Honeywell have come up with yet another idea about how they might get this merger--this $42 billion merger with Honeywell past EU antitrust regulators.

The latest proposal appears to be centered on GE's aviation leasing group. In fact, what we're hearing is that GE is talking about possibly selling a stake in that to non-competitors. Earlier, the EU anti-co--antitrust commission had suggested that maybe what GE ought to do is give part of that company to its competitors. Their concern at the EU is this--this group and GE controls buy so many airplanes for leasing purposes that they can control who they buy the engines from, say GE, or who they buy the avionics from, say GE and Honeywell. And what they don't want is they don't want them to control the whole process. So this kind of concession might go some way towards satisfying the EU's concerns, but it would still keep that group, the aircraft leasing group, within GE's control.
DAVID: What about fewer divestitures, though, o--of that avionics--the Honeywell avionics group?

Mr. BRAUCHLI: That would also be, apparently, one of the concessions. We're hearing that the--that the Honeywell avionics group, which is the--the equipment that goes into the cockpit of an airplane--that they wouldn't divest as much of that as they had previously proposed to the EU that they would do.
DAVID: All right. So n--do we have a time frame on this? There are some deadlines here, are there not? Early
July?

Mr. BRAUCHLI: Right. They're--we're basically--as you say, this is the--this is the last bid, and our--our--our reporting suggests that if this doesn't work out, you know, Honeywell and--and GE walk away. That's the end of this merger talk.

DAVID: Well, the arbs have been having fun playing the spreads here. We'll see what happens tomorrow. Thanks very much. We'll be checking on this and a lot more in the Thursday editions of The Wall Street Journal. Marcus Brauchli is national editor of The Wall Street Journal, live at headquarters tonight.

Van Miert tells US - Leave Monti alone - US leaders have been outspoken in their criticism of Mario  Monti's handling of the  GE/Honeywell  merger talks.
Former EU anti-trust chief Karel van Miert tells Peter Chapman that they risk undermining the credibility of
competition policy FOR the  EU's former compe

tition tsar Karel van Miert, the recent high-profile attacks on Mario Monti from across the Atlantic must resemble dÈjà vu.
But the man who four years ago fought a bloody battle with Boeing over its plans to merge with
McDonnell-Douglas has some tough advice for America: shut up and let Monti and his team do their job.

Van Miert admits he is perplexed by the US response to the apparent failure of the country's biggest industrial corporation, General Electric, to win European acceptance of its 51 billion
euro merger with Honeywell.

It is clear that GE and its chief executive Jack Welch thought "they should get their way", he says. When it was obvious that Monti was not goiung to play ball, "...then immediately the White House is called in".

The US response amounted to a denial of the "very essence" of the competition policies developed by America which it "rightly" spread across the world. "One can really be astonished...that from time to time we get these really awkward reactions. In doing so they [the
Americans] are undermining the credibility of competition policy," said van Miert.

Monti's handling of the GE-Honeywell saga has been pilloried for weeks by Wall Street commentators and senators such as Republican Phil Gramm (Texas) and Democrat Jay Rockefeller (West Virginia).
But anger reached its peak as President Bush was flitting between European capitals on his way to the EU-US
summit in Göteborg, in the same week as Jack Welch was Brussels in a final effort to save the deal.
When word reached Bush

that Welch's negotiations with Monti's merger task force were all but sunk, the President said he was "concerned". Commerce Secretary Donald Evans went further, describing Monti's decision to reject Welch's overtures as "very, very troubling".

Even trade chief Robert Zoellick, normally a man to choose his words carefully, accused Monti of relying on concepts which US economists had "given up on a long time ago". He was referring to the century-old theory on
'bundling' - which holds that the newly-merged c

ompany would have had a competitive edge by packaging together related products at a cheaper price than rivals could match.

Fortunately for the EU, van Miert says such comments will never wash with Monti - a man he describes as "even handed, pro-business" and "coherent". He added: "He does not bow to all kinds of pressure. Competition policy is safe in his hands."

In the Boeing case, the Commission and the company finally came to an agreement on concessions under the threat that the deal would be blocked
- but not before a barrage of criticism and abuse, in person and via the press, from Bill Clinton downwards.

The deal was saved - and a trade war averted - only after van Miert got Boeing to promise to relinquish exclusive supply deals with airlines. Ironically, van Miert says all the rancour about Boeing actually led to increased cooperation across the Atlantic which was formalised in a formal accord between the two sides a year later.
He said: "At the time of Boeing there were press articles, comments

and reactions, saying that the very fact that the Commission was pursuing a different policy from the US was going to damage cooperation. "In the real world it was the other way around, because from that moment on, cooperation became that much more intensive and systematic." As seen with GE/Honeywell, there are subtly different approaches taken by merger and anti-trust watchdogs on opposite sides of the Atlantic.
Put simply, the Commission looks more at foreclosure of markets and the squeezing out of comp

etition; the US examines the effects on prices in far greater detail. In spite of this the end result has, in most cases, been the same.

The two sides have exchanged reams of information on mergers and anti-trust cases such as WorldCom's abortive attempt to merge with telecoms rival Sprint and Bill Gates's stranglehold on the computer software market. "It has been very successful because since that time the only case where there have been differences of opinion is GE/Honeywell," said van Miert. "In many o

ther cases, even if at the beginning there had been differences in the analysis and how to approach things, both sides learned to cooperate in a very intensive way."

The former Commissioner, now the dean of Nyenrode University in the Netherlands, believes the GE-Honeywell controversy need not stop the two sides talking overnight. "I am not convinced that after what happened with GE, cooperation will lessen or derail. It might well be that even more increased efforts are made to get things done in
a more co
herent way."

Rules or methodology are unlikely to be harmonised. But the World Trade Organisation could be used as a forum for ensuring countries sing from the same hymn-sheet - a move thus far greeted with little support in Washington. "We always felt that the best available place was the WTO. It is not ideal; perhaps one should look for a different forum, but for the time being it is the best one, and a global one," says van Miert.
But he fears President Bush and his new administration might still scup

per the entente cordiale if their enthusiasm wanes - which it might if Brussels steps in to tamper with a forthcoming large US merger. "The big question in my mind is what the new administration is really going to do [about cooperation]."

If they don't want to cooperate, he says "...that might complicate the situation. But the GE case as such can't be the reason for derailing cooperation".
Although Monti has issued a draft report blocking the merger, the final deadline for a decision on the deal is 12 Jul y.

EU Commission - No Comment on US Criticism on GE, Competition.

BRUSSELS (MktNews) - The  EU Commission Thursday declined to comment on criticsm of its  competition policy by US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, and Brussels said it won't alter its deadline for the controversial investigation into the  General Electric-Honeywell merger.

Amelia Torres, spokeswoman for  competition policy, said she would comment on neither the U.S. official's criticisms, nor reports that  GE has offered to divest part of its financing arm in order to win  approval.
"I will make no comment on the substance" of the talks, she said.
She said the July 12 deadline for the EU's review cannot be altered as its is "legally binding."

Competition law has "nothing to do with politics and trade relations," she said, adding EU and US competition authorities have a good track record of cooperation.
"I'm confident this cooperation is solid enough to continue in future," she said.

GE tries to save merger

BRUSSELS, Belgium - General Electric  Co. representatives held talks with  European Union antitrust officials Wednesday that reportedly resulted in GE offering a last-ditch concession to save the company's $41 billion bid for Honeywell  International Inc.

GE proposed selling a minority stake of its aviation-financing unit,  GE Capital Aviation Services, the Wall Street
Journal reported on its Web site Wednesday evening, citing people familiar with the situation.

The revised proposal would be contingent upon the divestiture of fewer Honeywell avionics businesses than what GE had previously offered, which had combined sales of about $2.2 billion, the sources said. It also would not require that the stake be held by competitors, the Journal said.
The GECAS board would add outside directors proportionate to the stake, they said.

EU antitrust officials had expressed concern that GECAS, one of the world's top purchasers of aircraft, will promote GE-Honeywell equipment to the detriment of competitors.
Earlier, a source confirmed GE was engaged in talks with regulators on the deal.

"There is one last prod to see if there is anything there, then GE will walk away," a source close to the deal told the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. "I'm not very hopeful."

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said Wednesday the company's outside advisers have had informal discussions with European Commission staff.

In that proposal, GE offered to sell Honeywell units with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion and offered to introduce separate management for its aircraft leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services.

Today is the last chance for GE to change its proposal because any substantial changes must be passed on for review by EU member states, which need time to evaluate them before Tuesday's full-Commission vote.

GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.: Talks continuing with EU over Honeywell merger

General Electric  Co. representatives held talks Wednesday with  European Union antitrust officials about the company's $41 billion bid for  Honeywell  International Inc., though there was little optimism the deal could be saved.

"There is one last prod to see if there is anything there, then  GE will walk away," a source close to the deal said on condition of anonymity. "I'm not very hopeful."
An EU Commission source confirmed that GE is holding technical talks, but declined to elaborate. A final EU
ruling on the deal is expected Tuesday.
A GE spokesman confirmed that advisers in Europe had met with commission officials.

In what GE called its final proposal to the Commission earlier this month, it offered to sell Honeywell units with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion and offered to introduce separate management for its aircraft leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services.

The Commission fears GECAS, one of the world's top purchasers of aircraft, will promote GE-Honeywell equipment to the detriment of competitors.

Separately, in an appearance at the Economic Club of Detroit, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said it would be "off the wall" for the Commission to block the deal.

O'Neill said European regulators are "not elected, they're not subject to judicial review. They are the closest thing you can find to an autocratic organization that can successfully impose their will on things that one would think
are outside their scope of attention."

BRUSSELS, June 28 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Thursday that it was holding discussions with General Electric  Co and Honeywell  International about their planned  merger but declined to comment on the substance of the talks.

"Discussions are going on with the parties. I will draw your attention to the late stage in the review procedure on this merger and I will make no comment on the substance of the discussions,"  Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres told the  Commission's daily news briefing.

Sources close to the talks said GE had made an eleventh-hour effort to win European Union approval for the proposed $41.2 billion takeover of Honeywell and was ready to divest 19.9 percent of its aircraft leasing arm.

Under Commission rules, companies usually have until one month before the final deadline to make concessions to win EU approval. In this case, the deadline for concessions was June 14. Late concessions can only be accepted under certain circumstances.

Torres said the Commission was "in all likelihood", expected to take a decision on the case at its July 3 meeting, ahead of a final July 12 deadline for ruling on the case.
Asked if there was any flexibility about the July 12 deadline, Torres replied that the timetable to review mergers in
Europe was legally binding and the deadline could not be extended.

US official says US, EU should  talk on antitrust.

BRUSSELS, June 28 (Reuters) - European Union and U.S. regulators should hold talks to resolve  competition policy differences highlighted by the General Electric-Honeywell merger case, a senior U.S. official said on Thursday.

Grant Aldonas, U.S. Under-Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said he did not, however, expect U.S.-EU relations to suffer if the  European Commission blocked GE's proposed $41.2 billion acquisition of Honeywell  International .

The Commission was making judgments according to its policy, but there were differences in the EU and U.S. approaches to competition regulation, he said.

"If we want to resolve those differences we are going to have to sit down and have a discussion between our antitrust and competition policy authorities. That may be the route out from any potential future conflicts," he said.

Aldonas told a news conference during a Brussels visit he "supposed" there was still a chance the GE-Honeywell merger could win EU approval.

"My sense is certainly there is a still a dialogue going on about it. We're satisfied there's been a relatively open door in terms of getting proposals in front of the the Commission," he said.

GE's huge bid for Honeywell had seemed doomed since GE two weeks ago made concessions which fell short of the European Commission's demands. But it emerged on Thursday that GE was ready to divest 19.9 percent of
its aircraft-leasing arm in a last-ditch bid for EU approval.
The merger has already won U.S. regulatory approval. NO DAMAGE TO RELATIONSHIP
"I don't expect to see our relations suffer as a result of that... I don't see that at all, frankly," Aldonas said, when asked what the impact of an EU rejection of the merger would be.

Aldonas took a much more conciliatory line towards the European Commission than some other U.S. officials and members of Congress, who have attacked the EU competition watchdog over its objections to the GE-Honeywell deal.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said on Wednesday it would be "off the wall" if the Commission blocked the takeover.
Aldonas said that the Europeans had often complained about the "extraterritorial" reach of U.S. laws. In the
GE-Honeywell case, "the shoe is on the other foot," he said.

But he added: "I don't feel that the Commission is subject to any criticism about not hearing the parties out. There has been plenty of access and certainly an opportunity to be heard, but there may just be a different perspective on the substance at the end of the day."
The EU and the United States had an "ongoing dialogue" on competition policy, Aldonas said.

This provided a forum in which Charles James, head of the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division, and EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti could talk about competition issues, he said.
"In these things it's always good to have examples (of merger reviews) that point out the differences," he said. "This is an opportunity to figure out where we differ and what we might do down the road, but to my knowledge
there aren't those discussions at this stage of the game," he said.

In Europe, G.E. and Honeywell  ran afoul of 19th-century thinking.

THE European Union's recent recommendation to block the proposed $45 billion  merger of General Electric and Honeywell  International was based, in part, on an analysis by a noted French economist -- who has been dead for 124 years.

The economist is Antoine Augustin Cournot (1801-1877), the first scholar to apply mathematics to economics in a serious way. His book ''Researches Into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth'' was published in
1838. Remarkably, it is still cited today for its astute analysis of  competition and monopoly.

In one chapter, Cournot analyzed the strategic interactions between producers of complementary products, considering a market with two companies: a monopoly zinc producer and a monopoly copper producer. These
two supplied a large number of other companies that combined the metals to produce brass. Cournot asked what would happen to the price of brass if the copper and zinc producers merged.

In the G.E.-Honeywell example, G.E. produces airplane engines and Honeywell produces navigation equipment, communications equipment, landing gear and a number of related products. Both sell their products to aircraft manufacturers like Boeing or Airbus. Like the copper and zinc producers, G.E. and Honeywell produce complementary products, and the European Union's merger task force naturally considered Cournot's 1838 analysis of ''mergers of complementors'' in preparing its report.

The standard economic analysis of mergers of complementors looks at two extreme cases: what happens if the industries are highly competitive, and what happens if the industries are highly concentrated?

If a company's complementary products are supplied in a highly competitive market, mergers with complementors are usually a bad idea from the viewpoint of profitability. Microsoft is happy to see a competitive market for PC components, since this intense competition pushes the price of PC's down, increasing sales for Microsoft. Microsoft clearly understands that selling a proprietary product that is complementary to a competitively supplied product is a great business to be in.
But what happens when there are a small number of providers of complementary products, as in the
G.E.-Honeywell case? Only a handful of companies make airplane engines, and only a handful of customers buy
them.

To examine what happens with only a few price-setting complementors, let us examine Cournot's case of the zinc and copper producers. If the copper producer cuts its price, brass producers will buy more zinc, thereby
increasing the profits of the zinc producer. But the zinc producer's additional profits are irrelevant to the copper producer, making it reluctant to cut its price too much. The result is that the copper producer sets a price that is higher than the price that would maximize joint profits.

If, however, the copper and zinc producers merged, the merged entity would take into account that the price of copper affected the demand for zinc and set a lower price for both copper and zinc than independent producers would.

This is why a merger of complementors is normally considered a good thing: the combined company makes more profits than the premerger companies and prices are lower, making consumers better off.


Page 101 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So why did the European Commission recommend blocking the G.E.-Honeywell merger? They acknowledged that the ''Cournot effect'' would tend to lead to lower prices. But they then concluded that those low prices from the merged entity would make things a lot tougher for other producers of airplane equipment, like Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, Rockwell Collins and Thales. They may be right, but that is what competition is all about: make companies compete to push prices down and benefit the end consumers.

Furthermore, there is some question about how well the Cournot analysis applies in this case. Cournot looked at a model in which the copper and zinc producers each set a single price. In the airplane industry, Boeing and Airbus are not passive customers like Cournot's brass producers, but generally negotiate prices, and choose
best-of-breed components rather than a prepackaged bundle. Indeed, the European Union's merger task force had a hard time coming up with examples of discounts for bundles in the avionics industry.

When evaluating a merger, United States antitrust officials tend to focus on the benefits to consumers, while European regulators give substantial weight to the impact on competitors, especially if they are ''national champions.''

These considerations strike American economists as perverse. Indeed, several notable antitrust experts, like Carl Shapiro of the University of California at Berkeley and Barry Nalebuff of Yale, testified at the recent hearing held by the European Commission that the G.E.-Honeywell merger was likely to be beneficial to consumers.

It is important that antitrust authorities and regulators understand the peculiar economics of complements since they are especially prevalent in high-technology industries, like avionics and computer equipment. Hardware is useless without software, operating systems are useless without applications, and distribution networks are useless without content to distribute.

It's tempting for companies to want to acquire complementary producers, for the reasons described above. But as we've seen, it isn't always a good idea from the viewpoint of profitability.

What could be more complementary than movies and VCR's, or music and CD players? Sony recognized this and acquired the Columbia and TriStar film studios in 1989 for $3.4 billion. Five years later it had to write off $3.2
billion in losses associated with these acquisitions. The lesson? Expertise in consumer electronics is of little use in the content industry; the basic production processes are just too different.

When companies' core competencies are very different, it usually makes more sense to work out other ways of coordinating pricing and interoperability standards.

Of course, antitrust authorities rightly frown on companies' coming together to set prices, since the effect is often anticompetitive. On the other hand, if the products are highly complementary and are produced in highly concentrated industries, producers left to their own devices may set prices too high because of the ''Cournot effect.'' Economic analysis offers significant insights, but there is still a judgment call about which models fit the facts best in a particular case.

EU, GE still in Honeywell  discussions: EU Commission

ATTENTION - ADDS quotes, details

BRUSSELS, June 28 (AFP) - The European Commission said Thursday it is still engaged in closed-door talks with General Electric  regarding GE's proposed merger with Honeywell  International.
"Discussions are going on with the party," said Amelia Torres, spokeswoman for EU Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti, who looks poised to snuff the 45-billion-dollar (52-billion-euro) merger by a July 12
deadline.

"We draw your attention to the late stage of the review procedure of this merger," Torres told reporters. "I will not comment on the substance of the discussions."

GE, the world's biggest conglomerate, with interests ranging from aerospace to finance and media, announced its plans to purchase Honeywell last October and unify the two companies' aerospace activities.
US officials have already given a green light the deal, leaving the EU as the last hurdle.

But the commission -- which enforces anti-trust laws for the 15 EU member states -- is widely expected to announce that it is blocking the GE-Honeywell deal, after GE's refusal to make concessions demanded by Brussels.

On Wednesday, GE said its advisors had held informal discussions with European Commission staff earlier in the day, to "explore options or ideas that are within the financial parameters of our June 14 proposal."

A GE spokesman declined to comment on a Financial Times report that GE has made a new offer in an effort to gain European approval for the deal merging the two industrial conglomerates.

The newspaper said details of the new offer are not clear but are believed to include the sale of a minority stake in GECAS, GE's aircraft leasing unit, whose strong market position is the European Commission's main concern.

On June 14, GE said it was prepared to "ring-fence" GECAS from the rest of the group's aerospace businesses in order to ease European competition concerns.

GE and Honeywell  Continue  Talks With EU Officials --- Investors Optimistic Despite Slim Chances of
Compromise

BRUSSELS -- Trying to salvage their imperiled $42 billion merger plan, General Electric  Co. and Honeywell
International Inc. resumed negotiations with the European antitrust officials.

Investors greeted the talks with optimism, pushing shares of  Honeywell  up by 1.6%. Paradoxically, however, while odds of reaching an agreement seemed better by the very fact that discussions were taking place, the chance of finding a compromise that satisfied all players appeared slim, said people familiar with the situation.

While hopeful Honeywell executives are pushing GE to get a deal done, GE, which termed its package of concessions two weeks ago its "final offer," is more pessimistic that it can forge a proposal that fully addresses the European Commission's objections, these people say.

Advisers for GE and Honeywell and staffers at the commission's merger task force in Brussels were engaged in intense talks to see if the wide differences separating the companies and regulators could be breached, the parties acknowledged. The brainstorming is expected to continue today, with the deadline for a final ruling by the EU nearing.

The main stumbling block continues to be GE Capital Aviation Services, the aircraft-finance unit and large purchaser of aircraft that the commission claims unfairly pressures aircraft makers to buy GE products. In its final offer two weeks ago, GE proposed keeping the unit at arm's length from the avionics products it would acquire with Honeywell.

But the company continues to balk at the commission's suggestions that it spin off a piece of the unit to independent investors. The commission has been equally adamant that GE seeks some structural change in its operations that would level the playing field in regulators` eyes.

Though a compromise is possible, GE seems unlikely to accept any structural change that would see a partial flotation of Gecas, one of the largest and most profitable businesses in GE Capital and a key vehicle for generating earnings for the entire company.

EU Declines Comment on GE/Honeywell  Deal.

BRUSSELS, June 28 (Xinhua) - The European Commission on Thursday declined to comment on the latest talks on the planned merger of General Electric  (GE) and Honeywell  International that was opposed by the European Union (EU) over competition concerns.

The commission's competition spokesperson Amelia Torres said she had no immediate comment to make on the proposal by GE to divest 19.9 percent of its aircraft leasing arm in a renewed bid to win  EU approval  for its proposed 41.2 billion dollar takeover of  Honeywell.
The talks on Wednesday that included the divestiture proposal were seen as a new impetus for the merger deal. The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation EU, is scheduled to vote on the deal on July 3.
Under commission rules, merging companies usually have until one month before the final deadline to make concessions to win EU approval. In GE's case, the deadline for concessions was June 14 and the commission must make its final ruling by July 12.

In its offer submitted on June 14, GE proposed introducing separate management but refused to consider selling a minority share.
Torres said the commission had never missed a deadline while dealing with more than 7,000 merger deals so far. When asked to comment on whether a refusal by the EU would otherwise affect EU-U.S. political and economic
ties, Torres said a refusal would only be an enforcement of the EU competition law. "It had nothing to do with
politics or trade policies," she stressed.

General Electric  Co. representatives held talks with  European Union antitrust officials Wednesday that reportedly resulted in  GE offering a last-ditch concession to save the company's $41 billion bid for  Honeywell International Inc.

GE proposed selling a minority stake of its aviation-financing unit,  GE Capital Aviation Services, The Wall Street
Journal reported on its Web site Wednesday evening, citing people familiar with the situation.

The revised proposal would be contingent upon the divestiture of fewer Honeywell avionics businesses than what GE had previously offered, which had combined sales of about $2.2 billion, the sources said. It also would not require that the stake be held by competitors, the Journal said.
The GECAS board would add outside directors proportionate to the stake, they said.

EU antitrust officials had expressed concern that GECAS, one of the world's top purchasers of aircraft, will promote GE-Honeywell equipment to the detriment of competitors.
Earlier, a source confirmed GE was engaged in talks with regulators on the deal.

``There is one last prod to see if there is anything there, then GE will walk away,'' a source close to the deal told the AP on condition of anonymity. ``I'm not very hopeful.''

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said Wednesday the company's outside advisers have had informal discussions with European Commission staff. He would not comment on details of the talks.
A final EU ruling on the deal is expected Tuesday. Document KRTLB00020101018dx6s00hey

European Commission Kills  GE-Honeywell Merger
620 words
28 June 2001
Helicopter News
HLNW
[NOC]:
English
(c) 2001 Phillips Business Information, Inc.
GE and Honeywell  will not be exiting the military helicopter business after all, now that the  European                   Commission has spurned their merger petition.

The merger had been approved  by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in May, provided the combined company divested itself of Honeywell's  helicopter engine units. DOJ also required  GE to authorize a new service provider for the maintenance, repair and overhaul of certain aircraft engines and auxiliary power units (APUs).

GE readily agreed to these requirements, but said the European Commission was demanding that it divest itself of "virtually all of Honeywell's avionics business and its APU business." Such a massive divestiture would negate the very reason for the merger, GE officials argued. Consequently, they walked away from the deal.

"Jeff Immelt and I wanted to complete the transaction, but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal," said GE's Chairman and CEO, Jack Welch in a June 14 statement. "The Commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point... The[y] exceeded anything I or our European advisors imagined, and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the U.S. and Canada.

For its part, the Commission said that, in lieu of further divestments, it proposed an alternative solution that would have required "structural commitments to modify the commercial behavior of GECAS [GE Capital Aviation Services]. We regret that this avenue has not been pursued," said European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.
Conflicting Standards

At issue, analysts say, are conflicting standards of antitrust enforcement. In general, European regulators work to prevent market "dominance," whereas American officials focus on increasing "competition." This means that U.S. officials are more willing to countenance large-scale mergers, they say.

The European Commission, by contrast, harbors greater concern about the potential anti-competitive effects of marketplace dominance. Specifically, as it concerns the GE-Honeywell merger, the Commission was worried that the combined company might "bundle" avionics, engine and aircraft products so as to preclude competition and drive competitors out of business.

GE officials say the "bundling" and "dominance" theories have no basis in empirical reality. However, the Commission's demands were supported -- and actively pushed -- by several of GE's corporate rivals, among them: Rolls-Royce, Thales, and United Technologies, which owns Sikorsky [UTX].

"In our increasingly globalized marketplace, the European Commission's antitrust theories are dangerous," wrote George L. Priest and Franco Romani in the Wall Street Journal last week. Priest is a professor of law at Yale University. Romani was chairman of the commission that created Italy's antitrust law and a member of the first Italian antitrust commission in 1991

"There is every reason to believe that in international markets, firm size and scope will necessarily have to increase in order to provide consumer benefits more broadly," they wrote. "Smaller and more specialized firms such as Rolls-Royce and Thales will be at a disadvantage unless they expand their offerings."

"Their call to 'level the playing field,' therefore, reflects their desire to hobble the more ambitious and aggressive firms that will otherwise capture their customers by providing superior products or services."
Implications

The Commission's ruling has far-reaching implications for the rotorcraft industry, which needs to consolidate to reduce overcapacity. "Progress has been slow, but the broad outlines of a successful transformation are becoming clear," says aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia.

"Unfortunately, helicopters elicit a fairly passionate level of techno- nationalism in Europe, which leads to serious international squabbles on the road towards consolidation. And in the U.S., the antitrust regulatory environment has cast a shadow over any big moves."

GE Makes Bid to Save Honeywell  Deal --- Company Presents Proposal  To Sell Minority Stake In
Aviation-Finance Unit

General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc., in an 11th-hour effort to dissuade  European regulators from rejecting their proposed $42 billion  merger, offered to sell a minority stake of  GE's aviation-financing unit to noncompetitors in exchange for fewer divestitures of  Honeywell's  avionics businesses, according to people familiar with the situation.

On its surface, the proposal was crafted to appease some of the European Commission's expressed concerns regarding the deal, particularly about  GE Capital Aviation Services. The commission has argued that the
aircraft-finance unit, a large purchaser of airplanes, unfairly pressures manufacturers to buy  GE products. In earlier negotiations, the  commission had urged a structural change to the unit, such as selling a 20% stake to the public, or even selling a stake to competitors, ideas at which  GE balked.

The question is whether the latest offer is a satisfying enough change for the European Union competition officials. The new proposal, which was presented during meetings between GE and Honeywell lawyers and staffers of the commission's Merger Task Force in Brussels, would fall short of a public sale of a stake in the unit.

It also wouldn't involve GE competitors as stakeholders, people familiar with the proposal said. Likely holders of the stake GE proposed selling might include financial institutions, as an example, these people said. In addition, the board of the unit would add outside directors proportionate to the stake, they said.

The revised GE offer, the fruit of several days of discussions between the companies, also would be contingent on fewer divestitures of Honeywell avionics businesses than the ones GE previously had proposed selling off, which had combined annual sales of about $2.2 billion, these people said. Honeywell's total annual sales are around $25 billion, with its aerospace units accounting for about 40% of that.

Staffers from the commission are expected to get back to GE and Honeywell on the proposal today. The commission could outright reject the offer or ask for more time to study it. The commission has until July 12 to rule on the deal, but had been expected to reach a decision as soon as next Tuesday.
As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Honeywell shares were up 80 cents at
$37, while GE shares were down 53 cents at $48.26. In after-hours trading, Honeywell shares rose $2.15 to
$39.15, while GE shares fell 96 cents to $47.30. Both movements suggested that the market sees better
prospects for the deal to be completed.

While the odds of reaching an agreement seemed improved by the very fact that discussions were taking place, the chance of finding a compromise that satisfied all players still seemed slim to many of the parties, said people familiar with the situation.

While Honeywell executives, who played a large role in shaping the settlement, are pushing it hard, GE is more pessimistic about the proposal fully addressing commission objections, these people said. At the time GE submitted what it called its "final offer" to the EU on June 14, GE Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Welch Jr. said the commission's demands were far beyond the point to which GE was willing to go. A few days later, GE President and Chairman-Elect Jeffrey Immelt, in an interview with French newspaper Le Monde, put the chances of the deal succeeding at "nil."

At that time, GE's offer was to sell assets that generate $2.2 billion in revenue annually. The commission at that time had been pushing the companies to divest itself of assets that generate more than $6 billion in revenue.

The new offer does represent some movement by GE from that proposal, in which it also said it would keep GE Capital Aviation Services at arm's length from the avionics products it would acquire with Honeywell, but rejected the notion of spinning off any piece of the unit.

GE is reluctant to give up any control of the unit or allow competitors to get involved in one of the largest parts of the GE Capital unit and an important contributor to earnings and generator of cash for the company.

In part, the revamped proposal also seems aimed squarely at fulfilling general conditions laid out by European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in a letter sent this week to Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D., W.Va.), chairman of the aviation subcommittee, in response to an earlier letter to the EU complaining about its opposition to the deal.

In that letter, Mr. Monti wrote that in its earlier statements on the talks, "GE failed to explain that the commission was willing to settle the case with a remedy proposal that would have limited the divestiture of Honeywell aerospace products to below what GE has actually formally proposed."

"The only condition would have been to combine these limited aerospace divestitures with the implementation of a structural undertaking on Gecas [the aviation-finance unit], without putting in question the control by GE," Mr. Monti wrote.

Late yesterday, a GE spokesman said, "Our outside European advisers have had informal discussions with commission staff on options that are within the financial parameters of GE's June 14 proposal," referring to the package of concessions GE presented to the commission on that date. But he declined to comment on the substance of the discussions.
A Honeywell spokesman also declined to comment, as did a commission spokesman.

Earlier this week, the commission received the backing of most European member states for its opposition to the proposed merger, though some urged it to seek a compromise that could revive the stalled deal.

But the EU's stance has been criticized by U.S. lawmakers and officials. In the latest such criticism, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said yesterday that it would be "off the wall" for European antitrust enforcers to block the bid.

Noting that these officials are unelected and not subject to the same judicial review as U.S. antitrust enforcers, Mr. O'Neill called them "the closest thing you can find to an autocratic organization that can successfully impose their will on things that one would think are outside their scope of attention."
Mr. O'Neill's remarks came in response to a question after he gave a speech on international finance issues at
the Detroit Economic Club. The secretary has a reputation for speaking his mind, and the comments didn't appear
to signal a renewed effort by the Bush administration to pressure the Europeans.

REPORTS: NEW OFFER REJECTED BY EUGE HAD REVISED MERGER PROPOSAL

European regulators reportedly have rejected an 11th-hour offer from  General Electric  in its bid to win
approval  for a $42 billion takeover of Honeywell  International.
Late Thursday, Dow Jones Newswire, quoting unnamed sources, said  GE had received official word from the
European Union that its new offer would not be accepted.

The Associated Press, also citing an unnamed source, reported that the offer was rejected on its substance, not because it came too late.

Earlier Thursday, GE representatives reportedly met with European officials in Brussels to change what they had said was their final offer. The new proposal appeared to address what has been one of the European antitrust regulators' top concerns.

GE officials, who had called the deal almost dead two weeks ago, appear to be running out of time to make an offer the Europeans will accept. The EU faces a July 12 deadline to act on the merger.

GE offered to sell about 20 percent of its aircraft-leasing arm -- GE Capital Aviation Services, or GECAS -- to an outside financial company. That was a response to European concerns that GE would use GECAS's clout to force aircraft purchasers to buy only GE engines and Honeywell avionics, to the detriment of competitors such as East Hartford-based Pratt & Whitney.

But GE also reportedly wanted to reduce the amount of Honeywell products it had offered to divest itself of to win European approval for the deal. American regulators already have given their support to the merger, and American politicians have been highly critical of the European reservations.

European Competition Commission Mario Monti had planned to block the deal next Tuesday because of concerns that GE would dominate the market for jet engines and airplane electronics.

Monti initially wanted GE to sell a stake in GECAS to its competitors or the public. Apparently, GE's proposal did not go far enough.

Earlier Thursday, analysts had said the new offer appeared to keep the door open toward finding an agreement. It was unclear late Thursday whether that door is now shut.
"There has to be good faith on both sides," said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace industry analyst with the Teal
Group in Fairfax, Va.
Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I., doubted that the GE concession would satisfy the
EU, but he said it still could provide an opening for agreement.

"In a sticky situation, they've got a way of getting out and saving face at the same time," said Nisbet, adding that the EU had seemed open to negotiations all along. "They certainly haven't been the ones saying there is zero chance of this happening."

Competitors of both GE and Honeywell -- on both sides of the Atlantic -- are watching this final act closely. Among those with the most intense interest will be Hartford-based United Technologies Corp., which is widely expected
to make its own bid for Honeywell if the deal does not go through.
UTC is Pratt's parent company.

EU Spurns GE's Plan to Save Honeywell  Bid

BRUSSELS --  General Electric  Co.'s last-minute proposal to Europeanregulators to win approval  of the company's $46-billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. was rejected, sources familiar with the situation said Thursday.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is poised to scuttle the transaction when the commission meets next week, a move that would mark the first time the  European Union has acted alone to kill a merger. A rejection would be a blow to  General Electric  Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch, who delayed retirement to oversee the company's largest-ever acquisition.

Welch, who balked two weeks ago at making more concessions, had proposed selling a stake of about 20% in GE's plane-leasing unit to a financial services firm, sources familiar with the offer had said. An earlier offer to divest aerospace businesses with $2.2 billion in sales was scaled back as part of the latest proposal, the sources had said.

"Sounds like it's over," said Tim Ghriskey, a money manager at Dreyfus Corp., which holds shares in both companies.

The EU has said it plans to block the purchase because of concern General Electric would dominate the market for jet engines and airplane electronics. Although the modified offer addressed some of the EU's concerns, including how plane-leasing unit GE Capital Aviation Services is managed, antitrust experts and analysts said the offer by the largest company by market value didn't go far enough.
The purchase has received tentative approval from U.S. and Canadian regulators. Document latm000020010712dx6t01125

TRADE DANGER IN MONTI'S STAND OVER GE-HONEYWELL.
By ANTHONY HILTON.
402 words
29 June 2001
The Evening Standard
NS
English
(c) 2001
Brussels announced yesterday that it backed Competition Commissioner Mario Monti's stand against the proposed merger of American giants GE and Honeywell,  and in doing so raised the spectre of a full-scale trade row between America and the European Union.

Americans cannot understand how a  European body can block what they see as a domestic combination of two US businesses. They are largely unaware that there is a precedent for such action - the US authorities blocked a proposed merger between two Swedish pharmaceutical companies not long ago.

They wonder whether Monti is simply a loose cannon or whether there is some darker political agenda. The answer is a bit of both. Monti is probably the most able of the current crop of commissioners but his academic background can make him a purist - prone to too much rigorous logic and not enough pragmatism. But that makes it very unlikely that he would make a decision like this on political lines. However, many in Europe feel strongly that the Continent needs to bolster its defences against American business and cultural imperialism and they welcome Monti's stand.

Some political and business leaders are quietly enjoying the derailment of the American boom. It vindicates to some extent the slower, more restrained approach to growth of the euro-zone and has brought at least temporary respite from Americans telling them to liberalise their markets and get more like the US. And there is little inclination to help President Bush following his rejection of the Kyoto protocol on global warming.

But the real reason this deal has run into trouble is that US and European competition policies have a different focus. The Americans judged the merger on the effect it would have on the consumer while Monti considered the effect on competing businesses. The deal could be damaging to businesses like Rolls-Royce, which competes with GE in aero engines.

The danger is that reasonable objections will lead to unreasonable actions. The Europeans look unlikely to back down and so does GE's Jack Welch. The deal could well fail, with a consequent souring of trade relations between the two blocs. That is bad news at any time but doubly so in times of economic slowdown. This far away merger of which we know little could yet have a bad effect on us all.

GE Still Has To July 3 To Improve EU Offer On Deal -Source

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)-  General Electric  Co. (GE) still has the opportunity to save its  merger with Honeywell International Inc. (HON) but it must substantially change its proposal regarding its financing and leasing arm, Gecas, by July 3, a source said.

However, sources close to the deal are doubtful that  GE will improve its offer on Gecas. They say it's extremely likely the full 20-member  Commission will reject the deal on Tuesday.
"It is set to be blocked on Tuesday," an E.U. Commission competition source familiar with the case said Friday. On Thursday, E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told GE officials that he has rejected GE's latest
proposal to gain regulatory approval, saying the offer fell substantially short of the E.U.'s demands regarding GE's
powerful financing and leasing arm, Gecas, the Commission source said.
Monti's rejection paves the way for the Commission's formal blocking of the deal on Tuesday, the source said. While the E.U.'s legal deadline to make a decision is July 12, the Commission is set to decide on July 3 to block
the deal, the source said.

E.U. Competition spokeswoman Amelia Torres said that the Commission still hasn't decided whether a decision will be taken on July 3.

By taking a decision on July 3, the Commission gains a "safety net" so a last-minute decision doesn't have to be made at the Commission's July 11 meeting before the July 12 legal deadline, she said.

Torres said that if the Commission doesn't issue a decision on July 12, the deal would be automatically deemed as accepted. The Commission has never missed a deadline in more than 10 years of merger reviews, she said.

The chances of GE devising a new proposal are remote, but GE still has time to salvage the deal under the E.U.'s merger control rules, the Commission source said.
"(GE) has the right to submit (remedies) as long as it solves all the issues in a clear-cut manner," the source said. GE could still present the Commission with "clear-cut remedies that address the Commission's concerns and that
don't need to be market tested," the Commission source said.

The problem with GE's offer late Wednesday for a private placement of 19.9% of Gecas - which appeared to meet the Commission's demands - was that it wasn't a "clear-cut remedy," the source said.


The offer fell short because it didn't change the structure of GE's control of Gecas's purchasing policy, the source said.
- - 29/06/01 12-00G

Following the expected blocking of the deal by the Commission on July 3, GE won't be allowed to present any other proposals, the Commission source said.

Torres said that after mergers have been blocked by the Commission, the only way to salvage a deal would be to refile the merger notification, which means the entire process would be restarted. Another possibility is that the parties could go to court and challenge the Commission's decision.


Page 124 of 159 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"It's possible that they could refile," the Commission source said. "But we have not been informed that it's a likely outcome."

The closest the E.U. has come to blocking a U.S. deal that had been approved by the U.S. was in 1997 under Monti's predecessor, Karel van Miert, who risked a trade war with the U.S. by holding up Boeing Co.'s $15 billion takeover of McDonnell Douglas.

While former U.S. President Bill Clinton lobbied on behalf of the U.S. companies, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution declaring that E.U. rejection would be unwarranted interference in a U.S. business transaction.

The day before the Commission met to vote, Boeing made a new offer that included an agreement to loosen its exclusive contracts to sell planes to three major U.S. airlines - enough to secure tentative E.U. approval.

Antitrust experts from the 15 E.U. nations later reviewed the new concession and the formal green light was delivered at the Commission's meeting the following Wednesday.

Torres said that the Boeing case was "unique," but she didn't rule out the possibility that a similar situation could arise.

Under the E.U.'s merger rules, any new proposal introduced by GE after the June 14 deadline must be substantial and clearly resolve competition concerns.

If GE does present such a proposal and it is approved by the Commission's merger task force, it would then be forwarded to an advisory committee made up of E.U. member state national competition authorities for review.

Since GE's latest proposal didn't meet the demands of the merger task force, it won't be passed to the national competition authorities, the Commission source said.

The advisory committee doesn't have the authority to overrule the Commission. Its function is to give the Commission political backing in big merger cases. Competition lawyers don't recall a single case in which the committee has criticized the Commission's merger review to such an extent that the Commission has reversed its opinion.


After GE's June 14 proposal, the committee met on June 25 and almost unanimously endorsed the Commission's view that the GE deal should be blocked.
- - 29/06/01 13-44G

On Thursday, the Commission told GE that its structural changes for Gecas didn't meet its demands. Another problem was that the Commission continued to demand substantial divestments of Honeywell avionics products, while GE removed the majority of the avionics divestments and retained some prized products such as Honeywell's ground proximity warning devices.

Honeywell said in a statement Friday that those divestments were worth $1.1 billion, compared with GE's offer to sell businesses with annual sales of about $2.2 billion in its proposal on June 14.
The Commission source said the avionics offer fell short of the E.U.'s demands, but he didn't specify what the
E.U. was seeking.

EU Commission Source:GE Should Respond To Honeywell  Offer
704 words
29 June 2001
16:43
Dow Jones International News
DJI
English
(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission Friday said it is up to  General Electric  Co. (GE) to respond to  Honeywell  International Inc.'s (HON) latest push to gain E.U.  approval  for their $41 billion merger plan.
"The ball is in (GE Chairman and CEO) Jack Welch's court," said a  Commission source.

The source declined to discuss the Honeywell plan, saying it is up to E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti to evaluate any new proposal from GE and Honeywell.
Michael Tscherny, an E.U. competition spokesman, said "it's not up to the Commission to comment" on
Honeywell's proposal.

"The letter is addressed to GE," he said. "We won't comment on discussion between the Commission and the merging parties."

Honeywell said in a statement that it would reduce the merger's exchange ratio to 1.01 shares of GE for every Honeywell share from 1.055 shares, in a bid to convince GE to resubmit a proposal to the E.U. to receive regulatory approval.

The reduction in the ratio is worth about $1.5 billion, according to a New York-based arbitrageur. This would compensate GE for a loss of value for selling a minority stake in GE's financing and leasing arm, Gecas.


On Wednesday, GE offered to sell a 19.9% stake in Gecas to private institutional investors. On Thursday, the Commission told GE that its structural changes for Gecas didn't meet its demands.
- - 29/06/01 14-43G

On Thursday, E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told GE and Honeywell officials that he rejected GE's latest proposal to gain regulatory approval, saying the offer fell substantially short of the E.U.'s demands regarding Gecas.

The offer also included divestments of Honeywell avionics products worth $1.1 billion, according to Honeywell, down from GE's June 14 offer to sell businesses with annual sales of $2.2 billion.

A Commission source close to the deal said the problem with GE's offer wasn't the percentage divestment on GE. Instead, the Commission was pushing for an additional structural change that would ensure that Gecas couldn't promote GE's equipment to the detriment of competitors.

"The Commission wanted to make sure this bias wouldn't apply anymore," the source said. "It wasn't the percentage divestment, it was a change in the structure of GE's control of Gecas' purchasing policy."

The source said the Commission wanted more structural changes at Gecas - such as a change in the company's bylaws - that would make it difficult to unfairly bundle financing with product sales. The Commission wasn't satisfied with solutions that would mean competitors could complain only after the fact.

The source wouldn't reveal what precise mechanism the Commission was seeking to prevent Gecas from bundling services unfairly.

GE's Gecas offer meant that the 19.9% stake was to be placed with a large investor, who would receive in return one seat on the board of the aviation-finance unit, according to a source close to the deal.

GE's latest divestment proposal for Gecas was in addition to a previous GE offer, which involved setting up a compliance committee for Gecas to ensure the company doesn't bundle its avionics products sales with Gecas financing.

GE would also allow an independent expert to supervise Gecas' operations and to report to competitors. The plan calls for an arbitration mechanism in which GE's competitors could take civil action against GE if it was
determined that GE unfairly bundled its products with Gecas financing, according to the source close to the deal.
The Commission source said these solutions "weren't satisfactory" and were considered superficial changes. The source said the E.U.'s demand for a change in Gecas' purchasing policy structure struck "at the heart of the
case." GE probably refused to give in on the issue because it wanted to maintain de facto control of its financing
arm, he said.

Honeywell  sweetens GE merger deal

NEW YORK --  Honeywell  International Inc. on Friday proposed reducing the price of General Electric  Co.'s takeover offer to salvage a deal on the verge of collapse because of  European Union antitrust concerns.

Honeywell  made the offer because  EU regulators wanted GE to make divestitures that  GE viewed as financially unattractive, the company said in a statement.

The company offered to reduce the amount of stock GE would pay for Honeywell, effectively decreasing the value of the deal from $41.7 billion to $39.5 billion.

In return, under the Honeywell proposal, GE would make $2.1 billion of divestitures it originally offered to satisfy regulators but reduced to $1.1 billion after coming up with a plan to spin off part of GE's powerful aircraft-financing and leasing unit.
The new proposal to EU regulators would include both the $2.1 billion in divestitures and the partial spinoff. If GE accepts the offer, it would have to be approved by Honeywell shareholders.
"Honeywell's proposal satisfies all of the competition concerns and serves the best interests of all stakeholders," said Michael Bonsignore, Honeywell's chairman and chief executive. "It provides GE with better economics for the deal, and it satisfies the European Commission's divestiture requirements."

GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said the company could not immediately comment on the proposal because company officials had just received it.
The new proposal must be submitted to EU officials no later than Monday morning, Bonsignore said. European Union antitrust regulators wanted a better offer from GE, sources said Friday.
Before Honeywell made its new offer, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti turned down GE's latest proposal regarding the aircraft-financing and leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, late Thursday, according to sources close to the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity.

In a letter to GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch outlining the proposal, Bonsignore cited a conversation the two had with Monti Thursday as the reason for the new offer.

The spinoff and original divestiture offer "specifically address the concerns expressed by Commissioner Monti yesterday," Bonsignore wrote.
GE's offer to sell a minority stake in GECAS fell short because it didn't change the structure of its control of
GECAS' purchasing policy, said one source in the EU Commission.

Monti's office fears GECAS, one of the world's top purchasers of aircraft, would promote GE-Honeywell equipment to the detriment of competitors, leading eventually to higher prices.

Despite the rejection, EU officials said it was still possible that GE could try again before the next meeting of the full Commission on Tuesday.

Monti has said the Commission would likely vote on the deal at that meeting, although his spokeswoman, Amelia
Torres, stressed Friday that the final agenda had not yet been adopted.

The deal won conditional antitrust clearance in Washington in May, but its tortured path in Europe has raised concern among Bush administration officials. Some in Congress have even accused the EU of protectionism and threatened retaliation.
The 15-nation European Union must approve the deal between the U.S. companies, just as regulators in the
United States regularly have to approve mergers between European companies.

City - GE to allay EU fears on Honeywell merger.
By Simon English.

in New York

GENERAL Electric  is pursuing a new strategy with the  European Union which could see it sell off a chunk of its aircraft leasing arm in an attempt to secure  approval  for the $42 billion ( #30 billion)  merger with Honeywell.

GE earlier offered to sell off businesses with revenues of $2.2 billion to allay fears the deal will create a monopoly, but EU competition commissioner Mario Monti has indicated that a bigger concern is the stranglehold he thinks
the combined business would have on parts of the aviation industry.

Sources close to the company confirm it has offered to sell 20pc of Gecas, its aircraft leasing arm, but insists the offer is within the "financial parameters" of the previous terms.

This means it would make less divestitures in return for the Gecas sell-off. GE is now waiting for a response from the EU before a meeting of commissioners on July 3 in Strasbourg.

The EU is coming under fierce pressure from politicians to reconsider its decision to block the deal. On Wednesday, US treasury secretary Paul O'Neill said of the commission: "They are the closest thing to an autocratic organisation that can successfully impose their will on things that one would think are outside their scope of attention." He added EU regulators were "off the wall" if they thought they could block the proposed takeover.

European Union regulators rejected General Electric  Co.'s last- minute concession Thursday to try to save its
$41 billion bid for Honeywell  International, a source close to the deal said.

The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to give specifics on the  European Commission's reasoning, but said the revised offer was  rejected on its substance, not because it came too late.
GE spokeswoman Louise Binns declined to comment.

The rejection would clear the way for the Commission to formally block the deal Tuesday at its next meeting. The deadline for a decision is July 12.
Deere offering early retirement

Deere & Co. announced plans Thursday to cut 1,250 jobs by offering a voluntary early retirement program, a move the machinery maker says will save $90 million annually.
Moline, Ill.-based Deere said the early retirement option -- which will reduce its work force by about 8 percent --
will be offered to about 2,500 salaried employees. Those who accept will leave the company between Oct. 31 and
Dec. 31.
Software case settled in Lauderdale

The Business Software Alliance, a Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, recently collected $120,000 from Dayton Granger Inc., a Fort Lauderdale-based aviation manufacturing group, to settle claims relating to the use of unlicensed software products. The company agreed to delete any unlicensed copies, purchase replacement software and improve its software management policies.
New bank coming to South Florida

Atlantic States Bank plans to open a Fort Lauderdale office in July. Atlantic States, a subsidiary of Raleigh, N.C.-based First Citizens BancShares Inc., has 43 locations stretching from southwest Florida to Atlanta. The southeast Florida network will be headed by Steve Hickman, who used to work for Barnett Banks and BankAtlantic.
Big Daddy to offer ice cream deals

In an attempt to placate disappointed consumers, the distributors of Big Daddy lowfat ice cream said on Thursday they would be offering discount coupons that could include free containers.

"We think that's the very best way to make up for the mistake unless someone comes up with a better idea," attorney Mike Mosca said.
Big Daddy had become popular with dieters who believed the label that claimed 12 ounces of ice cream had only
100 calories. Tests by the Sun-Sentinel showed the real figure to be triple that.

DeConna Ice Cream Co., the distributor, said that in addition to the coupon offer new accurate labels would soon be placed on the ice cream.

AOL plans investment strategy

AOL Time Warner Inc., the largest media and Internet company, plans to invest about $100 million for three years in companies owned or managed by minorities and women.

The AOL Time Warner Opportunity Investment Fund will invest in companies with senior managers representing minority groups, companies that target under-served markets and firms whose businesses fit with those of AOL Time Warner, spokesman Ed Adler said.
Nokia plans to cut 1,000 jobs

Showing vulnerability amid a weakening global economy, Finland- based mobile phone maker Nokia Oyj plans to cut up to 1,000 jobs to improve its competitiveness.

The job cuts, mainly in marketing, sales and administration in the network operations business, are expected to be completed by the end of the year, Nokia said Thursday.
Nurses to affiliate with AFL-CIO

Representatives of the 100,000 members of United American Nurses voted unanimously Thursday to affiliate with the AFL-CIO in a quest for better pay and working conditions.

"You have not misplaced your trust and we're going to be even better together," John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, said in a welcoming speech.

The union is the collective bargaining arm of the American Nursing Association and represents nurses in 23 states and the District of Columbia.
Yahoo! spreads its musical wings

Yahoo! Inc. broadened its music offerings Thursday with the $12 million acquisition of Launch Media Inc., which runs a site that lets users watch videos, hear and download songs and read reviews.

Yahoo's purchase of Santa Monica-based Launch comes as it prepares to offer pressplay, a song-streaming service from Sony and Universal, sometime this summer.
SunTrust plans merger meetings

SunTrust Banks Inc. will hold a dozen or more "town hall meetings" in July to urge Wachovia Corp. shareholders to vote against Wachovia's proposed sale to First Union Corp. for $14.3 billion, Chief Executive L. Phillip Humann said.

"Between now and August 3, we are going to be talking to many, many -- probably thousands -- of Wachovia individual shareholders," Humann said.
No meetings are scheduled for South Florida. Document flss000020010711dx6t00s1u

GE chief executive  says new Honeywell merger offer "makes no sense"

NEW YORK (AP) - General Electric  Co. said last minute concessions proposed by Honeywell  International to save their multibillion dollar merger would not be enough to save the deal from rejection by Europeanregulators.

Honeywell  offered Friday to reduce GE's takeover price by $1 billion to offset the sale of operations it said would satisfy antitrust concerns by the European Commission that threatened to derail the deal.
But GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said the offer falls short of what regulators want.

"What the Commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," he responded in a letter to Honeywell's CEO. "The new deal you propose, in response to the Commission, makes no sense for our share owners, for the same strategic reasons."
Honeywell officials were "clearly disappointed in GE's decision to reject our proposed solution," said spokesman
Tom Crane.

An earlier proposal criticized by EU regulators is expected to be considered by the Commission next week, but analysts predicted it would be turned down.

"We thought it was dead. It still looks dead," said Kent Newcomb, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said GE has no plans to make any further proposals to the European
Commission.
"We're not optimistic of approval," Binns said.

Honeywell's new offer reduced the amount of stock GE would pay for Honeywell, decreasing the value of the deal from $41.7 billion to $39.5 billion.

GE would then make $2.1 billion of divestitures it originally offered to satisfy regulators, an amount it had reduced to $1.1 billion after coming up with a plan to spin off part of GE's powerful aircraft-financing and leasing unit.

The new Honeywell proposal to EU regulators would include both the $2.1 billion in divestitures and the partial spinoff.

"Honeywell's proposal satisfies all of the competition concerns and serves the best interests of all stakeholders," Honeywell chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore, said in a letter to Welch outlining the offer. "It provides GE with better economics for the deal, and it satisfies the European Commission's divestiture requirements."
EU Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny declined to comment on the letter.
Before Honeywell made its new offer, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti late Thursday turned down
GE's latest proposal regarding the aircraft-financing and leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, sources close
to the deal said Friday.

GE's offer to sell a minority stake in GECAS fell short because it didn't change the structure of its control of
GECAS' purchasing policy, said an EU commission source who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Monti's office fears GECAS, one of the world's top purchasers of aircraft, would promote GE-Honeywell equipment to the detriment of competitors, leading eventually to higher prices.

Monti has said the Commission would likely vote on the deal at a meeting Tuesday, although his spokeswoman, Amelia Torres, said Friday that the final agenda had not yet been adopted. The commission must act before July
12 or the deal is automatically approved.

The deal won conditional antitrust clearance in Washington in May, but its tortured path in Europe has raised concern among Bush administration officials. Some in Congress have even accused the EU of protectionism and threatened retaliation.

If the merger were to be officially rejected Tuesday, GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again, Torres said.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

The closest the EU ever came to blocking a U.S. deal that had been approved in Washington was in 1997 under Monti's predecessor, Karel van Miert, who risked a trade war with the United States by holding up Boeing's $15 billion takeover of McDonnell Douglas.

While President Bill Clinton and top aides worked the phones, the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution declaring that EU disapproval would be unwarranted interference in an American business transaction.

The day before the Commission met to vote, Boeing made a new offer that included an agreement to loosen its exclusive contracts to sell planes to three major U.S. airlines - enough to secure tentative EU approval at the meeting. The full Commission approved it the following week.
Honeywell produces engines, avionics and navigational systems at centers in Phoenix, Tempe and Tucson. In Friday afternoon trading, GE shares rose 91 cents to $49.78 on the New York Stock Exchange. Honeywell
shares were down $2.30, or 6 percent, to $36.65.

NEW YORK (AP) - Technical problems caused by a worker's error disrupted the Nasdaq Stock Market Friday, delaying final prices and the compilation of Wall Street's major indexes.

The problems with two key trading systems forced the Nasdaq to extend its regular trading session by an hour for the first time ever and cancel the late trading session it regularly holds.

Officials of the computerized stock market said an error by a Worldcom Inc. technician was to blame. They hoped to have both systems working by Monday.
It was the second straight day of trading problems for the Nasdaq, but officials said the glitches were unrelated.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Freed at least temporarily from a court-ordered breakup, Microsoft declared Friday it would not accept any settlement with the government that made changes to the company's structure.

The statement - one day after a federal appeals court voided the ordered breakup of Microsoft - puts the company on a collision with attorneys general from the 19 states that brought the antitrust suit against the software maker.

The states don't want any precondition on settlement talks and believe structural changes, up to and including a breakup, must remain on the table, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. economy barely inched forward in the first three months of the year and
President Bush's chief economist said that growth in the current quarter was likely even worse.

The Commerce Department reported Friday that gross domestic product - the country's total output of goods and services - grew at an annual rate of 1.2 percent from January to March, slightly slower than the government previously thought.

Lawrence Lindsey, the president's top economist, told reporters Friday he believed the economy was growing at an even weaker 0.6 percent rate in the current April-June quarter, based on his review of economic data that has been released so far.

That view is in line with many private economists, who have put growth at around 0.5 percent for the second quarter.

DETROIT (AP) - U.S. auto sales are shaping up to finish the year slightly ahead of expectations, a General
Motors Corp. executive said Friday.

The industry should end 2001 with total sales in the high 16 million range, said Paul Ballew, the executive director of global market and industry analysis for the world's largest automaker.

That is down from the 17.4 million that were sold last year, but the estimated sales still will likely come in ahead of what the industry has been expecting given the cooling down of the U.S. economy.
"We're probably a good reflection of an economy that's become sluggish but is still growing," Ballew said.

Gas stations are taking advantage of changing market conditions to rake in heftier profits margins during the busiest driving season.

Wholesale gasoline prices have plummeted by nearly 25 percent in recent weeks, but retailers haven't passed along those savings to consumers nearly as quickly, according to government data.

"There is some avarice at work, as there is everywhere in our economy," said Peter Beutel, publisher of the newsletter Daily Energy Hedger. "They figure the consumer is used to the high price."

Industry watchers expect intense retail competition and steeper prices cuts after July 4, typically a heavy day for travel. The average retail price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas is around $1.45 nationwide, down 14.5 percent from this year's high of $1.66 on May 14, according to federal Energy Department statistics.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Agere Systems, the semiconductor business recently spun off from Lucent Technologies, announced Friday that it would slash an additional 4,000 jobs to cope with a downturn in the communications market.

The move comes on top of the 2,000 jobs the company said in April it would eliminate. After the job cuts are complete, the company's total work force will be about 12,500 employees.

The company expects to take a charge of up to $900 million to cover costs of the restructuring, with $725 million of it taken in this quarter.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) - The first smoker ever to collect on a verdict against the tobacco industry saw his victory sealed Friday when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal from one of the nation's biggest cigarette makers.
"I hope this encourages anyone who has a case to file a lawsuit against a tobacco company," said 70-year-old
Grady Carter, who lost a lung to cancer.
Carter collected nearly $1.1 million from Brown & Williamson in March after winning a lawsuit against the nation's
No. 3 tobacco company in 1995.

The Supreme Court, without comment, declined to hear Brown & Williamson's case that the Florida courts should not have allowed Carter to argue that warnings on cigarette packages were deficient.
The cigarette maker had argued that a 1969 federal cigarette advertising law barred state lawsuits on that point.

DALLAS (AP) - Lawyers for a Texas woman who died last week are suing J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and Dutch insurer Aegon, charging that she unknowingly paid insurance premiums for six years and was denied compensation for a claim after a car accident.

The lawyers hope to turn the case into a $4.4 billion class-action lawsuit.

According to the lawsuit, Marguerite York was knocked to the ground and suffered a brain injury when her hired driver backed the car up while York was climbing in. She died last week at age 81 of the injuries from the 1999 accident, said one of her attorneys.

York's son discovered after the accident that she had been paying premiums for a $100,000 Penney's insurance policy since 1993 on her credit card, according to the lawsuit, which was filed late Thursday in state district court in Corpus Christi, Texas.

Technology stocks advanced again Friday, handing the Nasdaq composite index a five-session winning streak. The Nasdaq composite rose 35.08 to 2,160.54. For the week, the Nasdaq gained 125.70, an increase of 6.2

Stocks mixed in early trading

NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks were mixed in early trading Friday as investors locked in blue-chip profits and again bid tech shares higher following a federal court victory for Microsoft.

The market was also waiting to see if General Electric  and Honeywell  could salvage their  merger deal. The companies have yet to win  approval  from the European Union, which believes the deal could create a monopoly in aircraft-financing and leasing.
In the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 14.60 at 10,551.61.
But the market's broader indicators were higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 18.40 to 2,143.86, while the
Standard & Poor's 500 index inched up 0.50 to 1,226.70.

Analysts said some of the selling could be attributed to investors locking in profits ahead the July 4 holiday week. The market will close early Tuesday and remain closed Wednesday for Independence Day.

Some of the Dow's loss came from Honeywell, down 45 cents at $37.75, which on Friday proposed reducing the price of GE's takeover offer from $41.7 billion to $39.5 billion to save the merger. GE rose 23 cents to $49.10.
Blue chips' losses were widespread across many sectors. Banker J.P. Morgan Chase was down 35 cents at
$44.65, while Gap fell 46 cents to $29.24. Oil services company Halliburton fell $1.83 to $35.34 after its stock was
downgraded by Goldman Sachs.

Technology stocks fared better, continuing to benefit by association with Microsoft. The software maker, a Dow stock, inched up 6 cents to $72.80. A federal court ruling Thursday reversed a lower court ruling ordering the breakup of Microsoft.
Other tech gainers included Intel, up 56 cents at $30.20, and Oracle, which rose 57 cents to $19.75.

The mixed action on Friday was in keeping with investors' recent mood. Investors have been alternately skittish about earnings and the economy and hopeful that business will improve in the second half of the year. Investors were particularly hopeful on Thursday, sending the Dow up 131 points, in a delayed approval of the Federal Reserve's sixth interest rate cut of the year. The Fed on Wednesday lowered interest rates by a quarter point.

An economic report issued early Friday reminded Wall Street how dismal business has been this year. Gross domestic product - the country's total output of goods and services - grew at an annual rate of 1.2 percent from January to March, according to revised figures released by the Commerce Department.
The Russell 2000, which measures the performance of smaller company stocks, index rose 2.47 to 505.46. Overseas markets were mostly higher. Japan's Nikkei stock average ended Friday up 2.3 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index and France's CAC-40 each rose 0.6 percent, but Britain's FT-SE 100 slipped 0.1
percent.

GE chief executive  says new Honeywell merger offer "makes no sense"

NEW YORK (AP) -  General Electric  Co. rejected Honeywell  International's proposal to shave $1 billion off the price of GE's takeover offer and make major divestitures, saying it "makes no sense" for shareholders and falls short of European regulators' demands.

Honeywell - Arizona's largest employer - offered to cut the price early Friday because European Commission  
regulators wanted GE to sell off some operations in a move that  GE viewed as financially unattractive.

Within hours, GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch responded in a letter that said the proposal still falls short of what regulators will accept.

"What the Commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," he wrote. "The new deal you propose, in response to the Commission, makes no sense for our share owners, for the same strategic reasons."

Honeywell offered to reduce the amount of stock GE would pay for Honeywell, effectively decreasing the value of the deal from $41.7 billion to $39.5 billion.

In return, under the Honeywell proposal, GE would make $2.1 billion of divestitures it originally offered to satisfy European Commission regulators but reduced to $1.1 billion after coming up with a plan to spin off part of GE's powerful aircraft-financing and leasing unit.

The new Honeywell proposal to EU regulators would include both the $2.1 billion in divestitures and the partial spinoff.

"Honeywell's proposal satisfies all of the competition concerns and serves the best interests of all stakeholders," Honeywell chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore, said in a letter to Welch outlining the offer. "It provides GE with better economics for the deal, and it satisfies the European Commission's divestiture requirements."
GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said GE has no plans to make any further proposals to the European
Commission before its vote on the merger, expected Tuesday. She would not declare the deal dead.
GE does not plan to withdraw its existing proposal, Binns said, but added, "We're not optimistic of approval." Before Honeywell made its new offer, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti turned down GE's latest
proposal regarding the aircraft-financing and leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, late Thursday, according
to sources close to the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity.

In his letter to Welch, Bonsignore cited a conversation the two had with Monti Thursday as the reason for the new offer.

The spinoff and original divestiture offer "specifically address the concerns expressed by Commissioner Monti yesterday," Bonsignore wrote.
EU Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny declined to comment on the letter.

GE's offer to sell a minority stake in GECAS fell short because it didn't change the structure of its control of
GECAS' purchasing policy, said one source in the EU Commission.

Monti's office fears GECAS, one of the world's top purchasers of aircraft, would promote GE-Honeywell equipment to the detriment of competitors, leading eventually to higher prices.

Despite the rejection, EU officials said it was still possible that GE could try again before the next meeting of the full Commission on Tuesday.
Monti has said the Commission would likely vote on the deal at that meeting, although his spokeswoman, Amelia
Torres, stressed Friday that the final agenda had not yet been adopted.

The deal won conditional antitrust clearance in Washington in May, but its tortured path in Europe has raised concern among Bush administration officials. Some in Congress have even accused the EU of protectionism and threatened retaliation.

If the merger were to be officially rejected Tuesday, GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again, Torres said.
The 15-nation European Union must approve the deal between the U.S. companies, just as regulators in the
United States regularly have to approve mergers between European companies.
Honeywell produces engines, avionics and navigational systems at centers in Phoenix, Tempe and Tucson. In Friday afternoon trading, Honeywell shares fell $3.37, or 10 percent, to $34.33 on the New York Stock
Exchange. GE shares rose $1.51, or 3 percent, to $50.38.

NEW YORK (AP) _  Honeywell  International's proposal to shave $1 billion US off the price of  General Electric Co.'s takeover offer and salvage a  merger ``makes no sense,''  GE's chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said Friday.

Honeywell  offered to cut the price because  EU regulators wanted GE to make divestitures that  GE viewed as financially unattractive.

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the  General Electric-Honeywell merger is dead, at least for now. European Union regulators have rejected GE's last-minute attempt to save the $41 billion deal by selling its aircraft financing unit.

GE-Honeywell merger appears doomed after firms split on EU concessions

ATTENTION - RECASTS, ADDS stock prices

NEW YORK, June 29 (AFP) - The blockbuster  GE-Honeywell  merger appeared dead in the water after the two companies publicly split Friday over concessions to be made to gain approval  of Europeanregulators.

Honeywell  made an unusual appeal to  General Electric  early Friday to make additional concessions to the
European Commission -- even offering to cut the acquisition price -- but  GE quickly rejected the proposal.

With the two industrial conglomerates apparently deadlocked over how to proceed, the European Commission was poised to officially block the merger as early as Monday.

The extraordinary public plea by Honeywell suggested it was desperately seeking to salvage the merger, which EU regulators have been opposing because of concerns the merged company would be too dominant in aerospace activities.

Honeywell said it offered to drop its bid price in the deal to 1.01 Honeywell shares for each GE Honeywell share, down from a prior ratio of 1.055 Honeywell shares.

The offer would cut the acquisition price by about 1.5 billion dollars, making the deal worth some 40 billion dollars at current market prices.

Honeywell said the offer would be made if GE were to make additional divestitures of assets to satisfy concerns of the European Commission.

Honeywell said the concessions it asked GE to make included the divestiture sought by the EU of 2.2 billion dollars in GE holdings, as well as the sale of a 19.9 percent stake in GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS).

The strong market position of GECAS, GE's aircraft leasing unit, has been the European Commission's main concern. Critics of the merger say it could force buyers of aircraft to equip them with GE engines and Honeywell electronics.

GE had been initially been willing to sell off assets worth 2.2 billion dollars, but when it revised its proposal to sell a stake in GECAS, it reduced its proposed divestitures to 1.1 billion dollars.

Honeywell chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore, in an open letter to GE chairman Jack Welch, said that "I see no choice now but to return to the 2.2 billion dollars of divestitures" in a June 14 proposal.
He said the new offer had to be completed quickly -- within 24 hours -- to have any likelihood of getting EU
approval.

"We must amend the merger agreement and announce any change in the exchange ratio no later than Saturday," Bonsignore said.

But Welch replied in his own public letter that the Honeywell proposal makes "no sense" for shareholders of both companies, posing the same difficulties as the proposals by EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.
"What the Commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," Welch said.

"The new deal you propose, in response to the Commission, makes no sense for our share owners, for the same strategic reasons."

GE, the world's biggest conglomerate, with interests ranging from aerospace to finance and media, announced its plans to purchase Honeywell last October and unify the two companies' aerospace activities.
US officials have already given a green light the deal, leaving the EU as the last hurdle.

But the commission -- which enforces antitrust laws for the 15 EU member states -- is widely expected to announce that it is blocking the deal, after GE's refusal to make concessions demanded by Brussels.
Honeywell shares tumbled 8.64 percent to 34.90 while GE shares rose 0.27 percent to 49 dollars on the news. bur-rl/ch

Stocks mixed amid concerns over GE-Honeywell merger
382 words
29 June 2001
Agence France-Presse
AFPR
English
(Copyright 2001)
NEW YORK, June 29 (AFP) - Share prices were mixed early Friday in active trading on the final day of the fiscal quarter as traders fretted over whether the  General Electric-Honeywell merger would win EU approval.

The Dow Jones industrials edged down 1.73 points (0.02 percent) to 10,564. 48 at 1545 GMT while the Nasdaq gained 25.11 points (1.18 percent) to 2,150.57.
The Standard and Poor's 500 gained 4.41 points (0.36 percent) to 1,230.61.
Dealers said the Dow opened lower, pressured in part by sales of Honeywell and GE due to concerns about
Honeywell's last-minute effort to revive its proposed merger with its fellow Dow component.

The index moved in and out of positive territory as fund managers sought to push it to stronger ground on the final trading session of the first half.

The Nasdaq also benefited from the final second-quarter portfolio revisions and a carryover of the optimistic tone that followed Thursday's US Appeals court move to throw out a ruling that would have split Microsoft into two companies.

However, they noted that some investors were concerned because the Federal Appeals court upheld that the company had committed certain antitrust violations, a fact which should pose further problems for the software maker.
Microsoft fell 25 cents to 72.49 in volatile trade, after previously posting gains.

Other technology stocks were lifted by the positive tone and late- quarter purchasing, with Dell up 1.15 at 27.57, Oracle up 65 cents at 19.83 and Applied Materials up 2.44 at 52.01.
PMC Sierra managed to trade up 1.74 at 30.89 despite a new profit warning.
GE rose 33 cents to 49.20 in volatile trade while Honeywell was down 70 cents at 37.50 after Honeywell CEO
offered to drop the bid price for his company in return for GE offering increased divestiture to the EU.
On the bond market, the yield on the 10-year bond rose to 5.360 percent from 5.328 percent Thursday and on the
30-year bond to 5.711 percent against 5. 681 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.
