UPDATE 3-GE, Honeywell  pessimistic on gaining  EC approval.

(Recasts first two paragraphs, adds  EU comment and U.S. official in paragraphs 8 and 11, updates stock price)

BRUSSELS/NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Corp. said on Thursday they were not optimistic about gaining European regulatory approval  for their proposed $42.3 billion merger despite a last-ditch bid to salvage the deal by offering to sell $2.2 billion in assets.
GE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch, who postponed his retirement to help shepherd the
Honeywell transaction to completion, said the companies' divestiture offer was final.
European antitrust officials have demanded additional concessions totaling more than double those proposed by
GE and Honeywell.

"We're in a poker game here and the game is far from over," said Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with SG Cowen Securities. "I don't know whether Europe is going to want to be seen as submarining a big U.S. deal, but it has looked over time that the EU was going to take a hard look at this."
SHARES DROP IN NEW YORK

The news sent Honeywell shares plummeting in early trading, a sign investors are growing increasingly worried that the deal would be blocked. Honeywell shares shed as much as 15 percent of their value in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, before recovering slightly to trade down $3.34, or 7.9 percent, to $38.92 in late morning trading. GE gained $1.65 to $49.50.

GE and Honeywell officials said in a prepared statement that the divestiture package submitted to the EC in Brussels, just hours before a midnight deadline there (6 p.m. EDT), fell well short of the demands made by European antitrust authorities in recent weeks.

Welch, in a prepared statement, voiced dismay at the EC demands: "(GE Chairman-elect and President) Jeff Immelt and I wanted to complete the transaction, but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal. The commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point.

"In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined, and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the U.S. and Canada."

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a prepared statement that his agency would continue to review the proposed merger unless it was formally withdrawn.

Analysts said while the two sides appear to have reached a stalemate, the commission - which is the executive arm of the European Union - still has nearly a month to work out a compromise with the two U.S. firms.

But a senior U.S. official, speaking in Gothenburg, Sweden, where President George W. Bush was attending a summit, said the EU apparently had decided against the deal.
"We don't know what else can be done. The EU has apparently made up its mind," the U.S. official said. TENSE NEGOTIATIONS


Page 5 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Honeywell acquisition has already won approval from the U.S. Justice Department, which in recent days has sent at least one high-ranking official to Brussels to work with European regulators on the review.

GE and Honeywell officials have been locked in tense negotiations with European regulators the last few weeks, trying to broker a compromise that might allow their proposed union to go through. Monti and Welch also met twice Wednesday to personally try and resolve the impasse.
The companies' offer on Thursday does not stray much from their previous proposals. GE and Honeywell said
they would divest several divisions within Honeywell's aerospace unit and set up GE Aviation Services (Gecas) as
a separate entity that would deal at arm's length with Honeywell's avionics and non-avionics products but still be
100 percent owned and managed by GE.

The commission said Gecas gave an unfair advantage to GE by permitting it to offer bargain packages to airlines, including financing.

GE offered to make Gecas' financial arm a separate entity to deal at arms length with Honeywell avionics and non-avionics products, but the commission found that unacceptable.

"We have explored with the parties commitments which would not have entailed further divestments in the aerospace industry but rather a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior of Gecas," Monti said. "We regret this avenue has not been pursued.
GE has said the commission's demands would cost it billions in revenue and significantly hinder the
GE-Honeywell strategy for merging in the first place.

Instead, the companies proposed Thursday to divest several small Honeywell units, including regional jet engines, air turbine starters, and certain avionics and non-avionics products.

That proposal, if accepted, would reduce the companies' combined revenues by about 1.5 percent while lowering their expected earnings per share growth in the first full year to 9 cents from 11 cents, GE and Honeywell said. The companies' projected merger synergies of $3 billion would remain largely in tact, they said.

At one point it seemed that political intervention was possible. Before GE's statement, a White House spokesman had said that U.S. officials might raise questions about the commission's review of the deal at the European
Union-U.S. summit taking place Thursday in Gothenburg, Sweden. But a U.S. official later said, "It didn't come up."

NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Stocks fell in early morning trading on Thursday as the prospect of a failed merger between heavyweights  General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Corp. further spooked investors already on edge over corporate profit warnings.

The two Dow components proposed divestitures worth $2.2 billion to win European Commission approval  for their planned merger, but said they were not optimistic that the proposal would be accepted. Honeywell  dropped more than 8 percent and accounted for about a quarter of the Dow's loss.

The news comes as Wall Street battles a bevy of profit warnings as the second quarter comes to a close. Ketchup giant H.J. Heinz Co., computer memory firm Silicon Storage Technology Inc. and electronic parts maker CTS Corp. warned results will land shy Wall Street estimates.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 102.05 points, or 0.94 percent, to 10,769.57, after falling 1 percent earlier. GE perked 45 cents to $48.30, while Honeywell dropped $3.66 to $38.60.

The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 33.95 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,087.71. Software maker Micromuse Inc. helped push the tech-laden index lower with a $9.45 drop to $24.80, adding to the stock's 16 percent plunge a day ago on fears it would not meet expectations.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 9.13 points, or 0.74 percent, at 1,232.47. Document lba0000020010712dx6e01ko9

NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) -  General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Corp. on Thursday proposed divesting businesses with annual revenue of $2.2 billion to gain European Commission approval  for the companies' planned  merger, but they said they were not optimistic the offer would be accepted.

GE and Honeywell officials said in a prepared statement that the package submitted to the EC in Brussels, just hours before a midnight deadline there (6 p.m. EDT), fell well short of the demands made by European antitrust authorities.

The news sent Honeywell shares plummeting shortly after the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares shed $4.76, or 11.3 percent, to $37.50 in early trading. GE gained 75 cents to $48.60.
GE's proposed $42 billion acquisition of Honeywell has already won approval from U.S. antitrust officials.

GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch, in a prepared statement, voiced dismay at the EC demands: "(GE Chairman-elect and President) Jeff Immelt and I wanted to complete the transaction, but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal. The commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point. This shows you are never too old to get surprised.

"In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined, and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the U.S. and Canada."
The European Union had no immediate reaction to the companies' statement.
GE and Honeywell said they had offered to divest several divisions within Honeywell's aerospace unit and set up
GE Aviation Services as a separate entity that would deal at arm's length with Honeywell's avionics and
non-avionics products.

GE and Honeywell officials have been locked in feverish negotiations with European regulators in the last few weeks, trying to broker a compromise that might allow their proposed union to go through.

But EC officials have insisted on certain divestitures, including the spin-off of GE's Aviation Services unit, that they companies have resisted.

GE has said the EC demands would cost it billions in revenue and significantly hinder the GE-Honeywell strategy for merging in the first place.

Among the proposed divestitures within Honeywell's aerospace business are regional jet engines, air turbine starters, and certain avionics and non-avionics products.

U.S. stocks  fall on profit  warnings, Honeywell.

NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Stocks spiraled lower in late morning trading on Thursday as the prospect of a failed merger between heavyweights  General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Corp. further spooked investors already on edge over corporate profit warnings.

The two Dow components proposed divestitures worth $2.2 billion to win European Commission approval  for their planned merger, but said they were not optimistic that the proposal would be accepted. Honeywell  dropped about 7 percent and accounted for roughly a fifth of the blue-chip index's loss.

The news comes as Wall Street battles a bevy of profit warnings as the second quarter comes to a close. Ketchup giant H.J. Heinz Co., computer memory firm Silicon Storage Technology Inc. and electronic parts maker CTS Corp. warned results will land shy Wall Street estimates.

"It feels like an absence of buyers, I don't see any panic selling," said Ted Oberhaus, manager of equity trading Lord Abbett & Co. "I guess the feeling is the economic recovery is not imminent in the third or fourth quarter. When you hear the European Central Bank is lowering growth forecasts and the Japanese economy is deteriorating - that doesn't bode well over here in the states."

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 143.11 points, or 1.32 percent, to 10,728.51. GE rose $1.55 to $49.40, while Honeywell dropped $3.06 to $39.20.

The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 55.26 points, or 2.6 percent, to 2,066.40. Software maker Micromuse Inc. helped push the tech-laden index lower with a $8.25 drop to $27, adding to the stock's 16 percent plunge a day ago on fears it would not meet expectations.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 15.49 points, or 1.25 percent, at 1,226.11.

Fiber optic cable maker Corning Inc. fell $1.05 to $16.30 after Wall Street house Merrill Lynch said on Thursday it had lowered its intermediate-term rating, saying sales may be weak over the next few quarters.

Ketchup giant H.J Heinz Co. lost 18 cents to $42.25, saying its core profits dropped 18 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter and warnings in the current quarter would fall short of Wall Street estimates.

Texas Instruments Inc. fell $1.77 to $32.25. The semiconductor maker reiterated the company's financial outlook for the second quarter, saying revenues would fall 20 percent from the first quarter amid industry weakness.

Siebel Systems Inc fell $4.71 to $40.39 after German software rival SAP AG unveiled big partnerships and high-profile deals with customers show off its shift into Internet-based computing.

Food giant Kraft Foods Inc. dropped $1.70 to $29.55 one day after its market debut. Kraft fell below its initial public offering price of $31 per share.

Investors shrugged off a report that showed U.S. inflation at the wholesale level was tame in May. The producer price index, measuring prices paid to business for ready-to-sell goods such as clothing and goods, inched up to
0.1 percent from a 0.3 percent rise in April.

The government report offers reassuring news for Federal Reserve policymakers who will meet later this month to consider cutting interest rates. Wall Street, however, already widely expects the Fed will slice another 25 basis points off interest rates after five steep cuts this year to lift the economy.

A separate report showed the four-week moving average of jobless claims rose to 424,500, adding to Wall Street's gray mood. That was the highest level in almost nine years and pointed to further weakening in the labor market as the world's richest economy struggles to climb out of its slowdown.

EU not swayed by political intervention in mergers.

BRUSSELS, June 14 (Reuters) - The European Commission, asked about reports the U.S. administration may intervene over its review of General Electric  Co's proposed acquisition of  Honeywell  , said on Thursday it was never impressed by political intervention in merger cases.

The Wall Street Journal  Europe reported that GE chief Jack Welch had stepped up lobbying in Washington and that the Bush administration may raise the GE-Honeywell  issue at an EU-U.S. summit in Sweden on Thursday.

"As to political intervention, that's something that can happen, has happened in the past and never really impresses the Commission," Commission competition spokeswoman Amelia Torres said.

"The Commission must review mergers and acquisitions solely based on competition grounds. That's always what the Commission has done and that's what the Commission intends to continue doing," she told the Commission's daily news briefing.

"The Commission also treats all mergers the same, based solely on competition grounds, regardless of whether the companies involved are based in Europe or elsewhere in the world," she added.

The Commission is conducting an in-depth review of GE's proposed $42 billion acquisition of Honeywell. Welch met twice with European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti on Wednesday, sweetening his offers in an effort to win approval for the purchase, sources familiar with the situation said.

UTC COULD PURSUE HONEYWELL IF GE BID FAILS EUROPE'S TOUGH STAND MAY GIVE HARTFORD
GIANT ANOTHER CHANCE AT DEAL

If European antitrust regulators derail General Electric  Co.'s $42 billion acquisition of  Honeywell  International
Inc., Hartford's United Technologies Corp. may have a rare chance to turn the tables on its longtime rival.

UTC Chairman George David, whose bid for a  merger with Honeywell  was quashed by GE eight months ago, is widely expected to make another offer for the company.  GE Chairman John F. Welch lured Honeywell  from UTC by offering shareholders a better deal -- a deal that now seems to have soured.
"I can't believe that George David isn't watching this like a hawk. I don't think he'd mind finally trumping Jack
Welch," said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I.

But industry observers cautioned that the GE-Honeywell deal is not dead yet. And they said UTC has to do a fresh analysis of Honeywell before deciding whether to bid, and how much to offer.

Europe's hard stand on the GE deal could also raise broad questions for UTC and other U.S. companies about the European Union's role in approving -- or blocking -- global consolidation in aerospace and other industries. Analysts disagreed, though, about the significance of the GE decision. Some said the case is unique and won't be a precedent for turning down other mergers.

The controversy might also increase tensions between Europe and the United States at a time when disagreements about the death penalty, global warming and missile defense are already heating up.

It is unfolding on the eve of the Paris Air Show, the aerospace industry's premier gathering this year. The event will bring together thousands from the business, from aviation buffs to top executives such as David.
The GE-Honeywell debacle, as well as a growing rivalry between America's Boeing Co. and Europe's Airbus
Industrie, are expected to dominate the show.

GE said Thursday that it offered European regulators a final package of concessions that fell "far short" of what the authorities wanted.

If the deal dies, it would be the first merger of two U.S.-based companies that the European Union blocked. The EU, the governing body for the 15-nation union, has jurisdiction because the companies operate in Europe. A final decision is due by July 12. U.S. regulators approved the deal with minor conditions.

GE's biggest obstacle in Europe was its ownership of GE Capital Aviation Services, or GECAS, which leases planes to carriers globally. GECAS is one of the world's largest owners and buyers of jet aircraft.
Regulators in Europe were afraid that GECAS would use its clout to force aircraft manufacturers to buy
GE-Honeywell components. The broad range of products under the new GE umbrella makes it much easier for
GECAS to do that, they feared.
Analysts said Thursday that the GE-Honeywell merger is unique because of GECAS.
"This is really a pretty straightforward situation," Carl Opdyke of Forecast International in Newtown said. "GECAS
caused the problem, and GE's not going to give up GECAS. Honeywell goes back to square one."



Page 12 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Mario Monti, the EC's competition commissioner, said in a statement that if GE had agreed to a "structural" change in GECAS' organization -- industry observers say Monti wanted GE to sell the leasing unit -- the deal could have been approved.

The stalemate demonstrates the different approaches to antitrust enforcement on each side of the Atlantic. U.S. regulators rarely block a merger of companies that make complementary products.

Europeans, on the other hand, are more concerned about what is known as vertical integration: a joining of companies whose range of products can be used to freeze competitors out of the marketplace.
James Brock, an economics professor at Miami University of Ohio, said the concern is real.

"Our antitrust agencies take this extraordinarily myopic view of these mergers. They look for any tiny area where the companies share a market or have an overlap," Brock said. "If they don't find that, they say, `No problem.' Or they say: `Sell this plant, and it will fly.' "
Brock said the EU is more attuned to the potential problem that a corporate giant causes.

"The bottom line for me: more power to this Monti fellow and the European Commission. They are the ones who are actually defending the competitive marketplace. Shame on our antitrust authorities for not doing that."

Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., an official in the Reagan commerce department, said the dispute demonstrates a need for the United States and the Europeans to have comprehensive talks about their economic relationships. He said
the Europeans have been calling for the negotiation of global rules on competition policy through the World Trade
Organization.

If GECAS really is the EU's main concern, UTC might have a better chance of passing muster with regulators. It does not have an aircraft-leasing operation.

But GE has to kill the deal before another suitor could step in, one industry observer said. "It has to play out," he said. "And nobody should ever count Jack Welch out. Ever."

Other analysts noted that the Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. salvaged their merger by making last-minute concessions to the EU four years ago. The same could happen here.
Edward J. Stockton, UTC's former corporate economist, said the scrappy Welch is hard to predict.

"Right now, [the deal] looks dead," he said. "But whether they're positioning, whether they're still negotiating, it's hard to tell."
Nisbet said Welch's plain-spoken statement Thursday puts tremendous pressure on the EU.

"I personally think the deal will ultimately take place, more on Jack Welch's terms than on the EU's," he said. "But that's one minority opinion."

Abreast of the Market
Investors Scramble to Limit Pain From Trades Tied to GE-Honeywell

Members of the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average -- including  General Electric,  Honeywell  International and United Technologies -- made most of the news yesterday. As a result, the average fell sharply.

Selling hit after investors burned by the apparent collapse of the  merger of GE and Honeywell  scrambled to limit their fallout from some unsuccessful trades, while traders speculated about any successive deals.  Honeywell sank $5.16 to $37.10, after opposition by Europeanregulators to the takeover by  GE appeared to scuttle any chance of a successful conclusion to the combination of the two businesses. Trading in  Honeywell  shares zoomed, with 84. 3 million shares traded, up from the average 5. 5 million.

Shares of GE, meanwhile, managed to finish higher on the session, up 1.01 to 48.86, though not for fundamental reasons. Under traditional merger arbitrage, investors buy the stock of the target company, while "shorting" -- that is, betting on the decline -- of the acquiring company; arbitrageurs make money on the spread between the
trading price of the target and the actual price the acquirer pays.

Those traders yesterday had to sell quickly their shares of Honeywell, which led to the decline, while covering their short bets on GE by buying shares of the stock.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 181.49 points, a drop of 1.67%, at 10690.13; it marked the lowest the industrial average has closed in more than a month, since it ended at 10625.20 on April 25. Weakness in shares of United Technologies, another component of the Dow industrials, contributed to the drop, as investors speculated about whether the industrial company would re-enter the bidding for Honeywell. United Technologies shed 3.16 to 77.10.
The Nasdaq Composite Index also weakened, falling 77.59, or 3.66%, to 2044.07.

"There are several ramifications to seeing this deal fall apart," Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies, said, among them a trend toward protectionist government policies, rather than free-market forces. With the sensitivity to earnings forecasts, "it's hit the Street when we don't have the stomach for any kind of pain," Mr. Hogan added.
Shares of several software developers weakened badly on the day. Micromuse, which slid 19% Wednesday, fell
11.19 to 24.06 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, and sank near a 52-week low of 23.20, set April 4. Company
officials, appearing at an investment conference Wednesday, unsettled investors with remarks about how
challenging the environment has been in the software market. Several analysts following the company reduced
earnings forecasts on the remarks.

Shares of database-software maker Oracle (Nasdaq) retreated 65 cents to 14.85, ahead of the company's release of quarterly results, slated for Monday.
PeopleSoft (Nasdaq) struggled, falling 4.21 to 38.99. The decline came despite some upbeat comments from
Dain Rauscher Wessels, which started coverage of the enterprise-software developer with a "buy" rating, showing
how challenging the environment in software proved to be yesterday.

Computer-products distributor Ingram Micro eased 1 to 13.06, after saying it expected to break even, and might post a loss, for the second quarter, amid weak demand.

Corning fell 1.35 to 16. Merrill Lynch cut its rating on shares of the maker of optical fiber, saying Corning's high-margin optical-fiber pricing and sales will fall below expectations during the next several quarters.

The earnings pessimism proved so daunting, even denials that a company's profit was at risk weren't enough to support a stock. Shares of Texas Instruments, for example, dropped 2.51 to 31.51, even though the chip and handset maker's chief operating officer insisted at a conference Wednesday that the firm would live up to forecasts.

Intel (Nasdaq) fell 1.45 to 27.61, after officials of the chip maker, at a conference in New York, said conditions in the communications market won't improve until 2002.

Affiliated Computer Services fell 3.05 to 73.50. Lehman Brothers reduced its rating on the Dallas computer-services concern, saying the stock had reached its target.

Honeywell,  GE Deal Hits EU Barrier Merger: A rejection could test the trade and political bonds between
the United States and Europe.

WASHINGTON -- The proposed merger between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. is on the verge of becoming the first all-U.S. merger to be killed by European antitrust authorities after passing muster in the United States.

GE and Honeywell  executives admitted Thursday that their $42-billion  merger was doomed because their final offer to sell a large part of  Honeywell's  aerospace operations did not meet the demands of Europeanantitrust authorities.

European Union law gives the EU's executive commission the power to block mergers of any companies that do substantial business in Europe. The EU has used that authority 14 times since 1990 to block mergers between American companies. But in all those cases, U.S. antitrust authorities also were opposed.
GE Chairman Jack Welch, who met twice Wednesday with EU antitrust officials to try to salvage the merger, said
Thursday that Europe's conditions were too tough.
"We have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal," Welch said. "The [European]
commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point."

GE and Honeywell had proposed jettisoning Honeywell's jet engine business and certain other aviation products to win approval for what would be one of the largest industrial mergers in history. GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the $2.2 billion in divestitures was a "final offer."

Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane declined comment. But in a separate statement, the company said it was considering walking away from the merger.

"While continuing to support the merger, we have a comprehensive contingency plan in place if we must move forward as an independent company," Honeywell Chairman and CEO Michael R. Bonsignore said.
The apparent end of the deal sent Honeywell stock plunging $5.16, or 12%, to $37.10 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The shares had surged as high as $55 after the deal was announced in October. GE shares rose
$1.01 to $48.86 Thursday, as some investors expressed relief the ordeal might be drawing to a close.

Mario Monti, the EU's antitrust commissioner, had given GE and Honeywell a deadline of midnight Thursday to propose sufficient divestitures, and he has until July 12 to make his final decision. He could be overruled by the EU's full panel of 22 commissioners--but that has never happened before.

Monti, who turned down a chance to be Italy's foreign minister because he wanted to remain as the EU's antitrust chief, feared the merger--without massive divestitures--would put the new American company in a dominant position in the sale of jet aircraft engines and other parts.

For Welch, who had postponed his retirement until the end of this year to oversee the merger, rejection of the deal would kill his hopes of uniting GE's aircraft engine business with Honeywell's electronic aircraft controls.

It also could test the trade and political bonds between the United States and Europe. After the EU expressed opposition to the merger of aerospace giants Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. in 1997, a trade dispute nearly erupted between the United States and European nations. That merger ultimately went ahead.

The largest merger successfully opposed by the EU was WorldCom Inc.'s plan to buy Sprint Corp. for $152 billion. The U.S. Justice Department also blocked that deal.

Honeywell has 125,000 employees around the world, including 3,300 in Southern California. GE employs 340,000 worldwide, including workers in San Rafael, Calif., and Ontario.

"The marketplaces on both sides of the Atlantic are becoming very integrated . . . and there are a lot more competitive issues that must be assessed," said Willard Berry, president of the European American Business Council, a Washington-based advocacy group on transatlantic trade issues.
European antitrust review, he added, "has become a really huge issue" for U.S. companies.

Calling the proposed merger "an important deal," U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick said he has discussed the proposed combination with European officials.

Eleanor Fox, a New York University law professor who served on a Justice Department task force on global antitrust issues, said global firms like GE and Honeywell should be better prepared for antitrust scrutiny overseas. She said she saw no sign that protectionism motivated the EU's hard line against the GE-Honeywell deal.

In addition to blocking 14 American mergers, the EU has gained significant modifications of scores of others, including the 1997 Boeing-McDonnell Douglas deal and last year's merger of America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc.

Strome Investment Plans New Risk-Arbitrage Hedge Fund
By Allison Bisbey Colter

LAKE TAHOE, Nev. -(Dow Jones)- Strome Investment Management LP, a Santa Monica, Calif., hedge-fund firm, is launching a risk-arbitrage fund targeting institutional investors.

The timing may not be ideal. Risk-arbitrage funds, which are also known as  merger-arbitrage funds, haven't been attracting much new money lately, and many closed to new investors in the first quarter. Now that one of the largest mergers in history appears to have fallen victim to European regulatory concerns, a lot of hedge funds that were betting on a narrowing of the discount in Honeywell  International (HON) share price to  General            Electric Co.'s (GE) offer are believed to be sitting on big paper losses.

But President Mark Strome told investors and managers at an industry conference Thursday that the firm's more diversified flagship fund was proving a hard sell to endowments and multi-manager hedge funds because its strategy is difficult to classify. In addition to risk arbitrage, Strome looks at distressed securities and at companies going through special situations like tobacco and asbestos litigation.

Lately, he's also been bailing out venture capital funds that are desperate to free up capital for new investments and looking at real-estate investment trusts that are being created by companies to spin off their property holdings.
Strome Investment stayed away from the GE-Honeywell deal, however.

That's too messy for many big investors who want hedge funds that fit into a well-defined strategy so they can be sure of their asset allocation. So the new fund will stick to investments in companies that are recapitalizing or involved in mergers or acquisitions.
Strome said the firm hopes to raise $150 million.

Despite the increasing demands of institutional investors for a standard classification system, there's still no equivalent in the hedge-fund industry of the well-defined "style-boxes" used by mutual-fund trackers. In fact, Strome said some investors make further distinctions between risk-arbitrage and merger-arbitrage strategies.

Since the pace of mergers and acquisitions slowed last year, these strategies have become less profitable, and some managers are taking on a lot of risk in the form of borrowed money to boost returns.

TASS Research, a unit of Tremont Advisers of Rye, N.Y., estimates event-driven funds as a group took in $1.4 billion of new money in the first quarter, but reckons that much of that went into funds that specialize in distressed debt and other special situations, rather than risk-arbitrage funds..
The CSFB/Tremont Event-Driven Hedge Fund Index is up 5.2% for the first four months of the year.

EU Denies Gecas Divestiture Demand In Honeywell  Deal

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The  European Commission is disputing reports that it would have required General Electric  Co. (GE) to sell off its aircraft financing arm,  GE Capital Aviation Services, or Gecas, as a condition of GE's proposed merger with Honeywell  International Inc. (HON).

Instead,  European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in a statement said the parties had been discussing "a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior of Gecas. We regret that this avenue has not been pursued."

The E.U. had raised concerns that Gecas, one of the world's largest purchasers of airplanes, would steer business for jet engines and other aviation equipment to GE, according to the Wall Street Journal. While GE had proposed changes in the corporate structure to insulate Gecas from GE, European Commission spokesman Willy Helin said differences remained over the degree of structural separation that would be necessary.
He declined to elaborate further.

"It is not true that what we were requesting would have meant divestitures by the extra billions of dollars," said Helin, of the European Commission Delegation's Washington office, during his weekly press briefing. "One of the options was ... a structural response to the behavior of one of the affiliate companies, Gecas. If they had done that commitment, that would not have meant further divestitures at all."

Barbary Mgr: Conv Arbitrage Is Next Hedge-Fund Disaster
By Allison Bisbey Colter

(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
LAKE TAHOE, Nev. -(Dow Jones)- Stephen Worthington, managing director of Barbary Coast Capital Management of San Francisco, thinks convertible arbitrage is the next accident waiting to happen in the hedge fund industry.

Right now it's merger arbitrage funds that are in the hot seat as  European regulatory concerns have apparently derailed General Electric  Co.'s (GE) buyout of  Honeywell  International Inc. (HON). Many hedge funds that were betting the deal would go through are sitting on big paper losses.

The size of hedge-fund losses, which The Wall Street Journal estimated could be around $1 billion, reflects too much money chasing too few deals.

While there are plenty of new issues of convertible bonds, Worthington thinks the amount of money investors are throwing at convertible-arbitrage hedge funds can only mean trouble. He is worried that managers are chasing prices so high they may be forced to take on too much risk in order to meet their targeted investment returns. Convertible bonds are hybrid instruments with fixed-income-like returns that can be converted into company
stock. If something unexpected goes wrong, like a sudden change in the direction of interest rates, or a default by an issuer, funds arbitraging these bonds could be hit hard.

"Convertible arbitrage is going to be the next disaster in hedge funds," the manager said at an industry conference here sponsored by Managed Account Reports.

Convertible arbitrage has been one of the hottest areas in the hedge-fund industry this year, attracting $1.02 billion, or nearly one-sixth of all new money in the first quarter, according to TASS Research, a unit of Tremont Advisers of Rye, N.Y.

Not surprisingly, issuance of convertible bonds is running at record levels as hedge funds put the money to work. Total issuance reached $49.9 billion in the first five months of the year compared with $61 billion for all of 2000, according to convertbond.com, a unit of Morgan Stanley. Indeed, hedge funds have picked up much of the slack in demand from securities firms that have cut back on trading convertible bonds in their proprietary accounts.

Worthington runs $40 million in a fund that primarily bets on declines in stock prices. The manager also has some leeway to dabble in various arbitrage strategies in the fund, but says he's steering clear of the convertibles market for now.

Convertible arbitrage was one of the best-performing hedge-fund strategies in the first four months of the year, with the CSFB/Tremont convertible-arbitrage hedge-fund index returning 7.6% through April. The strategy benefited from falling interest rates and from heightened market volatility, which gives portfolio managers more opportunity to exploit differences in valuations between the stock and bond elements of convertibles.

A convertible-arbitrage trade typically involves buying a convertible bond and betting on a decline in the underlying stock. But it has become harder for hedge funds to make money with this strategy since volatility declined in mid-April following a surprise rate cut by the Federal Reserve.

Worthington said he is concerned some managers may try to boost their returns by using too much leverage, or borrowed money. And he thinks managers may be too complacent about the interest-rate environment.

Senate Panel To Make Inquiries Into E.C. and GE-Honeywell

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The likely rejection by the EuropeanCommission of the proposed  merger between General Electric  Co. (GE) and Honeywell  International Inc. (HON) is raising questions from two U.S. senators overseeing antitrust issues.

"This is a complicated transaction, one upon which reasonable people might differ," said a joint statement from Sens. Herb Kohl, D-Wisc., who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's  Antitrust subcommittee, and Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, the ranking Republican.

"However, the stark difference in conclusions reached by the American and European antitrust authorities may indicate a need for further examination of the various processes and standards used by the different agencies," the senators said.

In contrast to the E.C., the Justice Department on May 2 approved the merger, subject to the relatively minor divestiture of Honeywell's $200 million helicopter engine business and related services.

"In light of these recent developments, we intend to make further inquiries into whether the divergence between American and EU opinion is evidence of a rift in coordination and legal standards or is the product of a legitimate difference in opinion," the senators said.
Other lawmakers declined to comment directly on the deal, noting that the European Commission has until July
12 to make a final decision. However, the deadline for GE to substantially address's the E.C.'s concerns passed
Thursday night with the two sides far apart.

One Capitol Hill staffer said that lawmakers are "clearly paying attention," saying the E.C.'s action "raise eyebrows, particularly since the Department of Justice cleared it."

The topic of international harmonization of antitrust law has been kicking around Washington for some time, and separately, a task force report last year outline "best practices" for the over 80 antitrust authorities around the world. Kohl and DeWine have held meetings with European Competition Commissioner Mario Monte to discus international coordination, in forums that fall just short of an on-the-record Senate hearing.
"The question is now, will this (GE-Honeywell) kick it into something bigger," one staffer said.

GE, Honeywell  Refuse More Concessions; Bush "Concerned"

BRUSSELS (AP)--The $41 billion  merger of General Electric  Co. (GE) and Honeywell  International Inc. (HON) was edging closer to collapse Friday after the companies refused a belated European Union offer to make more concessions to meet the  antitrust concerns of the 15-nation bloc.

One day after the official deadline for company concessions, E.U.  Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said Friday that both firms still have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals."

A GE spokesman said, however, that the companies won't make changes to the divestiture plan they have already submitted, which GE has said didn't come close to meeting conditions set by the Commission.
"We will not make another proposal," said the spokesman, Gary Sheffer. "Negotiations are over."

After spending two days in Brussels trying to salvage the deal, GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said the companies couldn't agree to terms laid down by E.U. regulators.

"In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined," Welch said Thursday.

Honeywell also said it still wants to merge with GE, but announced it was now considering its future as a stand-alone entity.

Asked about the GE-Honeywell talks Friday during a news conference in Poland, U.S. President George W. Bush said he was "concerned that the Europeans have rejected it" after both U.S. and Canadian regulators approved it.

In Paris, U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans urged the E.U. Commission to approve the deal, saying a successful deal would be "a positive kind of step for free trade".

"I would encourage (the E.U.) to think how constructive a merger like this would be," Evans said at a news conference at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
"I'm still hoping they will work out their differences," he said.

Meanwhile, United Technologies Corp. (UTX) officials held informal meetings Thursday about the possibility of making a bid for Honeywell, The New York Times reported Friday, citing unidentified sources. United Technologies was in such discussions last fall, but called off the talks after GE emerged as a Honeywell suitor.
The proposal submitted by GE and Honeywell to the European Commission included $2.2 billion in divestitures. GE said regulators were demanding billions more in divestitures of virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics
business and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.
Welch said his company has "always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal."

E.U. regulators will now pass along details of the GE offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission, which will issue a decision by July 12.
But GE said it wasn't optimistic that its proposal will be approved.

The E.U.'s top antitrust official, Mario Monti, expressed "regret" at the companies' position, but said his office would continue to review the deal "unless the merger notification is formally withdrawn."

GE said its proposal would reduce Honeywell's $25 billion in revenues by 9%, and that combined GE-Honeywell revenues would decline by about 1.5%. Despite the divestitures, GE said anticipated costs savings of $3 billion from the merger would remain largely intact.

Hope for GE merger dimming

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The $41 billion merger of General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International has been all but called off after the companies refused Europe's demands to cut the size of the combined company.

European Union Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said today that both companies still have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals."

A GE spokesman said today that the companies won't make changes to a divestiture plan they submitted that was rejected by EU officials.
"We will not make another proposal," said the spokesman, Gary Sheffer. "Negotiations are over."

After spending two days in Brussels trying to salvage the deal, GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said the companies could not agree to terms laid down by EU regulators.

"In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined," Welch said Thursday.

Honeywell also said it still wants to merge with GE but announced it was now considering its future as a stand-alone entity.

"We have a comprehensive contingency plan in place if we must move forward as an independent company," said Honeywell's chairman and CEO, Michael R. Bonsignore.
Asked about the GE-Honeywell talks today during a news conference in Warsaw, President Bush said he was
"concerned that the Europeans have rejected it."

United Technologies officials held informal meetings Thursday about the possibility of making a bid for Honeywell, The New York Times reported today, citing unidentified sources. United Technologies was in such discussions
last fall, but called off the talks after GE emerged as a Honeywell suitor.
A United Technologies spokesman did not immediately return a telephone message seeking comment.

The proposal submitted by GE and Honeywell to the European Commission included $2.2 billion in divestitures but did not come close to meeting conditions set by the commission, Welch said.

GE said regulators were demanding billions more in divestitures of virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.
Welch said his company has "always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal."

EU regulators will now pass along details of the GE offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation the European Commission, which will issue a decision by July 12.
But GE said it was not optimistic that its proposal will be approved.
Rejection would kill Welch's vision of combining GE's dominant aircraft engine and servicing business with
Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics for commercial jets and air traffic control systems.

It would also be a personal blow for Welch, who postponed his retirement until the end of 2001 to oversee the merger, which was approved by U.S. regulators in May.

The EU's top antitrust official, Mario Monti, expressed "regret" at the companies' position but said his office would continue to review the deal "unless the merger notification is formally withdrawn."
Sheffer said GE has no plans to withdraw the proposal.
GE said its proposal would reduce Honeywell's $25 billion in revenues by 9 percent, and that combined
GE-Honeywell revenues would decline by about 1.5 percent. Despite the divestitures, GE said anticipated costs
savings of $3 billion from the merger would remain largely intact.

In a statement late Thursday, Monti said European regulators were still "giving guidance on how best to resolve the remaining competition concerns."

But Welch left Brussels Thursday after talking with Monti for the third time in two days. To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by U.S. law to do business in America. An EU decision to block the deal could also spark a trans-Atlantic trade war.

Europe has become a tougher environment for mergers, with Monti in his two years on the job blocking or requiring substantial modifications to several high-profile deals, including a proposed deal to merge MCI WorldCom and Sprint.

In his statement, Monti said he was not necessarily seeking "further divestments in the aerospace industry but rather a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior of GECAS," GE Capital Aviation Services.
Monti's office previously cited concerns about the effect on competition of "bundling" GE jet engines with
Honeywell electronics and GECAS financing.

GECAS is one of the world's leading buyers of commercial aircraft, which it later sells or leases to airlines and other customers.
The EU is worried GE could use GECAS' financial clout to sway airlines and aircraft manufacturers to choose GE
engines over competing brands made by such companies as Rolls-Royce PLC and Pratt & Whitney.
GE said Thursday that it offered to set up GECAS as a separate "ring-fenced" entity to deal at arms length with
Honeywell.

But that apparently did not go far enough to satisfy the Commission's Merger Task Force, which initially pressed GE to spin off GECAS to the company's existing shareholders. GE negotiators had dismissed that option as unacceptable.

White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, traveling with President Bush in Sweden on Thursday, said Welch contacted White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card about the conflict between GE and European regulators.

"I know they spoke. I can't say specifically if there was a request, what it was. The United States obviously supports the merger." Asked whether Welch wanted Bush to press the matter with EU officials, Fleischer said, "I'm not prepared to say that. I don't have that information."
At the news conference Friday in Warsaw, President Bush said in response to a question about the
GE-Honeywell talks with the EU, "We brought up the proposed merger at the appropriate levels during this trip
and before the trip."

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it. The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it. That's all I've got to say on it," he said.

Newscast:  European regulators deal GE-Honeywell merger a fatal blow

NANETTE HANSEN, anchor: We begin with a deal in doubt. After months of wrangling it looks like European regulators may deal with a fatal blow to the $41 billion  GE-Honeywell merger, now all but called off. European regulators insisted that  GE, the parent of this network, comply with a list of concessions. Apparently, GE's offer wasn't good enough and the fallout may be global. CNBC's Leslie Laroche is in Brussels.
Leslie, when can we expect a final decision here? LESLIE LAROCHE reporting:
Well, hi, Nanette.

We are standing outside of the European Commission, and those talks between GE and the EU took place right around the corner up until yesterday. Now as you mentioned, GE not prepared to accept the remedies that the EU seemed to be proposing, and I say `seemed' because up until the last minute, Mario Monti, who heads the Competition Commission, said that a compromise was possible.

But here's the process ahead: There's a--a confidential memo that's being circulated amongst member regulators. They will fine-tune the EU opinion up until July 12th. We'll get a final ruing there. And very quickly, I just want to remind you that the EU has a legal obligation to vet any mergers and acquisitions involving companies that have significant revenues in Europe. That's why they're giving this deal such a hard look.
Nanette, back to you.
HANSEN: Leslie, thank you very much. Leslie Laroche in Brussels this morning. Document eart000020010711dx6f0010v

Analysis: Possible  fallout  from GE-Honeywell  deal failure

NANETTE HANSEN, anchor: If this deal does die it will be historic, the first time  regulators in Europe will have killed an American  merger already approved  by the US. CNBC's Garrett Glaser now with more on the fallout if the deal falls apart.
GARRETT GLASER reporting:

How can it be that the regulatory environment is so different across the pond? Over the last several years, chief regulator Mario Monti and others have blocked or required substantial modification in several big M&A deals, including MCI WorldCom-Sprint and Boeing-McDonnell Douglas. Are they anti-American? Not really, say
anti-trust attorneys in this country. It's just that they do business differently.

Mr. TOM KENAP (The Wall Street Journal): They really want to see that competition is there in the marketplace and as soon as they're concerned that this is not the case, and apparently they are in this thing here, they come down very hard.

GLASER: The effects of a merger are more closely scrutinized in Europe, say M&A attorneys who work there. One area studied closely is the potential for layoffs.

As to the impact of a GE decision to walk away, minimal. One fund manager in New York said, `I don't see this as a negative. GE is regarded by many as one of the best-positioned industrial giants.' Honeywell, on the other hand, faces a more uncertain future. Would it be worth as much going forward?

Mr. MATT COLLINS (Edward Jones): I think we'd probably see a lower premium, just because of the problems Honeywell's had over the last couple of quarters. They had some very disappointing results. GE did come in and really potentially gutted the company and may have left it not quite as attractive for United Technologies.

GLASER: United Technologies--the company made a nearly accepted offer for Honeywell last fall. Will it try again, and would it make sense for UTX?

Mr. SAM PEARLSTEIN (First Union): Certainly there's a lot of complimentary products there. They'd gain the avionics business that Honeywell has, which as electronics is taking on more and more importance in the plane, certainly would help benefit a lot of the other United Technologies systems.

GLASER: UTX shares fell on the session, on concern that arbitrageurs will move in to shore up the stock ahead of the game, as well as longer-term worries about integration issues and profitability. Garrett Glaser, CNBC, for EARLY TODAY.

GE balks at EU merger rules Honeywell  deal appears doomed

General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. refused to meet  Europe's demands that they pare their
$41 billion proposed merger, all but ending a bid to forge one of the world's largest industrial companies.

GE said Thursday it was "not optimistic" that European regulators would approve the deal, even though it offered to sell off businesses with $2.2 billion in revenue to satisfy antitrust concerns.

The company said its proposed divestitures fell far short of the demands of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. It said the commission wanted it to divest "billions more."

Jack Welch, GE's chairman and chief executive, said the company "wanted to complete the transaction, but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal." Welch noted that Europe's conditions "differed sharply" from those of U.S. and Canadian regulators.

Honeywell, meanwhile, indicated that it was prepared for the possibility that it might not be acquired by GE. "We have a comprehensive contingency plan in place if we must move forward as an independent company," said Chairman and CEO Michael Bonsignore.
With the acquisition increasingly in doubt, shares of Honeywell fell $5.16, to $37.10, on the New York Stock
Exchange. GE shares gained $1.01, to $48.86.

GE and Honeywell faced a Thursday deadline to submit a proposal addressing the commission's concerns that the Honeywell deal would enable it to dominate the European market for jet engines.
GE said the two companies submitted "a final, detailed package" in which they offered to divest several
Honeywell divisions, including those making business and regional jet engines.

European regulators and GE's rivals also are worried that GE Capital Aviation, the largest aircraft-leasing company, will buy only Honeywell aerospace products, just as it chiefly buys GE jet engines.
Despite the deadline, negotiating is expected to continue, with a European Commission deadline of July 12.

The EU's top antitrust official, Mario Monti, expressed "regret" at the companies' position, but said his office would continue to review the deal "unless the merger notification is formally withdrawn."

Heard On The Street
Likely Collapse Of Honeywell  Deal Hits Arbitrageurs --- Transaction Is Latest Blow To Takeover Traders
By Robin Sidel

Already hurt by a big slowdown in merger and acquisition activity, traders who invest in takeover stocks have been hurt badly by the stand-off between General Electric  Chairman John F. Welch Jr. and Mario  Monti, Europe's chief antitrust regulator.

Takeover experts estimate the arbitrage community has lost more than $1 billion (1.17 billion euros) in the past two weeks amid expectations that  Honeywell  International Corp.'s proposed acquisition by General Electric  Co. will fall apart. That is a far cry from the anticipated 30% annualized rate of return based on the price they purchased the shares.

It is the latest blow in a year that has fallen far short of the stellar results seen in recent years when the stock market was booming and the pace of mergers was blistering. Takeover experts estimate arbitrageurs own between 80 million and 100 million shares of Honeywell. Takeover traders make their money by betting on the likelihood that a proposed merger will be completed. In this deal, they snapped up Honeywell shares on the hopes that the deal would be completed on terms announced in October.
"Obviously, this has been very painful. The losses are going to be very big," said Tom Burnett, president of
Merger Insight, an institutional research service.

The growing concerns about the future of the $41 billion deal reached new heights when Mr. Welch acknowledged for the first time that it wasn't optimistic its $2.2 billion divestiture proposal would pass European regulatory muster.

Thursday, shares of Honeywell changed hands at $37.10 a share, down 12%, or $5.16 a share, while General Electric rose 2.1%, or $1.01, to $48.86. Some traders held onto their Honeywell shares yesterday on the hopes that another bidder will step in.

Mr. Monti, the European Competition Commissioner, is expected to continue the antitrust review until July 12, but many takeover experts viewed the transaction as nearly dead.

The development sent the deal's so-called spread -- the difference between Honeywell's stock price and the implied value of the GE stock shareholders would receive -- soaring to $14.45, from a spread of about $2.80 last month. They make money when the differential between the nominal price and the target's stock price goes to zero.

The widening differential between the nominal price shareholders would receive and where Honeywell is trading signals that there was a growing belief that the transaction had an increased risk of getting rejected.

The General Electric-Honeywell deal is the latest transaction that has disappointed takeover traders so far this year. In March, Tyson Foods Inc. canceled a planned $3.2 billion acquisition of IBP Inc. And traders also fretted for months over the outcome of Deutsche Telekom AG's purchase of VoiceStream Wireless Corp., although that deal has been completed.

As of May 31, the average fund managed by takeover traders rose 4.83% this year compared with an 8.98% gain for the same period last year, according to Van Hedge Fund Advisors International Inc.

"There's a lot of blood out there. People had it among their larger positions because they thought there was a large probability the deal would get done," said one takeover trader.

Indeed, it was the very words of Mr. Welch that gave many takeover traders comfort when the deal was unveiled in October -- even though some experts predicted antitrust problems. Mr. Welch, who delayed his retirement to oversee the integration of Honeywell, said he didn't anticipate any antitrust issues.

Takeover traders also were optimistic about the likely outcome of the deal because it had already received approval from the U.S. Department of Justice, which ordered only minor concessions. But the European regulatory agency has increasingly played hardball in recent months, even on transactions like this one that involves two U.S.-based firms.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Europe to GE: Go Home
822 words
15 June 2001

An epic quality has come to  GE's battle to get the Honeywell  acquisition approved  by European regulators, which after the latest meeting between Jack Welch and European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti seems all but kaput. The drama highlights the need to bring order to antitrust enforcement before it gets out of hand and undermines the global marketplace.

By nature, Europeans  seem disinclined to view the property rights of companies as any kind of inhibition against regulators doing whatever they please. In the  Honeywell  case, novel antitrust theories have been dreamed up simply because it would be unthinkable to let a large U.S. company go about its business unmolested. What might have given enforcers pause in any responsible jurisdiction is that opposition to the  GE-Honeywell merger comes almost entirely from  GE's competitors.

It would be hard to exaggerate the ludicrousness of this. When a firm's rivals complain about a deal being "anticompetitive," obviously they mean the opposite, that it would produce benefits for customers that they'd have to respond to. But the intellectual quality of the commission's deliberations was evident in the 1997
Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger, when Boeing was kneecapped into dropping exclusive contracts with two U.S. airlines. These deals were voluntary transactions on American soil, but giving them up was the price Airbus demanded for nodding the merger through.

Commissioner Monti's official challenge to the Honeywell buyout reportedly lifts passages from a brief by Rolls Royce, GE's rival in aircraft engines. What fills the competition with dread is the possibility that GE might package engines and Honeywell avionics under terms buyers would find attractive. Quelle horreur. This is called standardization, a hallmark of efficiency and industrial progress for 200 years. But we guess the idea is to block innovation because it might discomfit a competitor who prefers an unchanging world, requiring no effort to adapt. This is typical of monopolists and cartels, but seems to be the EC's ideal of "competition."

Mr. Monti's office also tried to rework GE's relationship with its aircraft-leasing arm, which commands a mere 10% of the relevant market. Gecas's business is not directly implicated in the merger, but the commission apparently saw an opportunity to take a customer away from GE engines and redistribute its business to GE's rivals.

This is foolish and, in some sense, corrupt, at least if the Commission pretends to base its positions on economic analysis. U.S. antitrust at times has also been an interest group pinata, but its silly actions are dissected by courts and lawyers, with the result that sophisticated, skeptical analysis has advanced.

The European Commission seems beyond reason at this point, with nothing to fear from judicial review and having picked a popular punching bag in GE, icon of what many continentals affect to find disturbing about "Anglo-American" capitalism. But attentive European pols and business leaders should at least be open to self-interest.

The nearest parallels to the way the Commission deliberates about antitrust are the occasional jags of the U.S. Congress, such as the one that nearly sank Deutsche Telekom's recent acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless. Alcatel lately was sniffing around Lucent. Germany's Bertelsmann, France's Vivendi and other European firms with global aspirations consider freedom to make acquisitions in the U.S. market, protected by our laws, essential to their hopes. They should be letting Mr. Monti know he's playing with fire.

We should also note that Mr. Monti's office has become a regular stopping place for U.S. firms seeking help to stymie their competitors. Microsoft's enemies are as busy in Brussels as they are in Washington. And Pratt & Whitney, outbid by GE for Honeywell, now works the hallways of the Brussels bazaar to thwart its rival.

Page 36 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Maybe it's time to revisit the basic outlines of public choice, the analytic framework that won James Buchanan the Nobel Prize. By funding these kinds of efforts, firms only increase the incentive for regulators to meddle by increasing the rewards of meddling. And where does it end?

Seventy years ago, trade warfare plunged the world into a depression and global conflagration. Nowadays, trade is still important, but the vast preponderance of international economic activity is actually the investment and marketing efforts of thousands of multinational firms -- U.S., Canadian, European, Japanese, soon to be joined by a growing horde of global companies based in what we used to think of as "developing" countries.

Nothing would roll up today's healthy, peaceful progress of the world economy faster than tit-for-tat corporate sabotage masquerading as antitrust enforcement. This is the risk Europe runs with its prolonged torture and apparent killing of the GE-Honeywell deal.

GE, Honeywell  refuse to meet European Union conditions for merger

By RAF CASERT Associated Press Writer

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union regulators suggested more bargaining Friday with General Electric  Co. on its proposed $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International, but  GE insisted the EU must take or leave the last offer.

The deal to create one of the world's largest industrial companies needs  approval  by Europe, but GE and Honeywell  reaffirmed their willingness to walk away from a  merger rather than meet EU demands that they sell off parts of their companies in the process.

The companies submitted a final proposal Thursday, the formal deadline for making concessions, and acknowledged at the time it was far from what EU regulators wanted.

On Friday, EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said both firms still have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals."

GE's response was immediate: "We will not make another proposal," said company spokesman Gary Sheffer. "Negotiations are over."

EU regulators were worried that the merger would give GE an unfair advantage over some European companies. They will now pass along details of the GE offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission, which will issue a
decision by July 12.

A decision to block the deal could damage trade relations between the United States and Europe, which were threatened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

Europe has become tougher in its review of mergers, blocking or insisting on important modifications to several high-profile deals.
GE had sought White House support for the deal, and at a news conference Friday in Warsaw, Poland, President
Bush said, "We brought up the proposed merger at the appropriate levels during this trip and before the trip."

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it. The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it," he said.

In Paris, U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans urged the EU Commission to approve the deal, saying a successful deal would be "a positive kind of step for free trade".

"I would encourage (the EU) to think how constructive a merger like this would be," Evans said at a news conference at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
"I must be an eternal optimist," he added. "I'm still hoping they will work out their differences."

GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch, who had led negotiations in the final days in Brussels, has said he considered approval unlikely. Honeywell said it was ready with plans to move ahead on its own, but there was immediately speculation that it may renew merger discussions with United Technologies Corp., which had been a suitor until GE moved in.

The proposal submitted by GE and Honeywell to the European Commission included $2.2 billion in divestitures. GE said regulators wanted them to sell off billions more, including nearly all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.

EU holds door ajor for GE, Honeywell  to make belated concessions on merger

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The day after an official deadline, the  European Commission said Friday General   Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International still had "limited" time to make concessions to get  approval  for their
dlrs 41 billion proposed merger.

EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said companies have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals," if the earlier ones are deemed insufficient. She did not elaborate.

The proposals the companies submitted to the European Union's antitrust office hours ahead of Thursday's deadline did not come near to meeting the demands of the 15-nation bloc, GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said.
Welch said Thursday the EU demands were beyond "a point at which we wouldn't do the deal."

The GE-Honeywell proposal, which includes dlrs 2.2 billion in divestitures in Honeywell's aerospace business, was a "final offer," said GE spokesman Gary Sheffer.

Rejection by European regulators, who must make a final decision by July 12, would kill the vision of combining GE's dominant aircraft engine and servicing business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics for commercial jets and air traffic control systems.

To do business in Europe, American companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by U.S. law to do business in America.
The EU's top antitrust official, Mario Monti, expressed "regret" at the companies' position.

GE said EU regulators were demanding billions more in divestitures of virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.

EU holds door ajar for belated offers from GE, Honeywell

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The day after an official deadline,  European Union regulators said Friday that General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International could still improve their offer to satisfy antitrust objections to their proposed dlrs 41 billion merger.

EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said the companies have a "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals," if the earlier ones are deemed insufficient.

The proposals the two companies submitted to the EU's antitrust office hours ahead of Thursday's deadline did not come near to meeting the demands of the 15-nation bloc, GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said.
Welch said Thursday the EU "demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined."

The GE-Honeywell proposal, which includes dlrs 2.2 billion in divestitures in Honeywell's aerospace business, was a "final offer," said GE spokesman Gary Sheffer.
GE said EU authorities were seeking "billions more" than the selloffs proposed by the two companies.

In case the companies want to return to the table, Torres said any new proposal should immediately and fully meet all EU worries about the proposed merger.

"Those proposals are only acceptable if the Commission concludes that they remove competition concerns completely and if they will also allow time for a proper consultation" within the EU, Torres said.

Rejection by European regulators, who must make a final decision by July 12, would kill the vision of combining GE's dominant aircraft engine and servicing business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics for commercial jets and air traffic control systems.

To do business in Europe, American companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by U.S. law to do business in America.
The EU's top antitrust official, Mario Monti, on Thursday expressed "regret" at the companies' position.

GE said EU regulators were demanding billions more in divestitures of virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.
In a statement, Monti said he was also seeking "a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior of
GECAS," GE Capital Aviation Services, GE's financing arm.

GECAS also is one of the world's leading buyers of commercial aircraft, which it sells or leases to airlines and other customers.
The EU is worried GE could use GECAS' financial clout to sway airlines and aircraft manufacturers to choose GE
engines over competing brands.

GE said Thursday that it offered to set up GECAS as a separate "ring-fenced" entity. It had dismissed as unacceptable early EU demands to spin the unit off.

GE, Honeywell  refuse to meet European Union conditions for merger

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union regulators suggested more bargaining Friday with General Electric  Co. on its proposed $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International, but  GE insisted the EU must take or leave the last offer.

The deal to create one of the world's largest industrial companies needs  approval  by Europe, but GE and Honeywell  reaffirmed their willingness to walk away from a  merger rather than meet EU demands that they sell off parts of their companies in the process.

The companies submitted a final proposal Thursday, the formal deadline for making concessions, and acknowledged at the time it was far from what EU regulators wanted.

On Friday, EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said both firms still have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals."

GE's response was immediate: "We will not make another proposal," said company spokesman Gary Sheffer. "Negotiations are over."

EU regulators were worried that the merger would give GE an unfair advantage over some European companies. They will now pass along details of the GE offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission, which will issue a
decision by July 12.

A decision to block the deal could damage trade relations between the United States and Europe, which were threatened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

Europe has become tougher in its review of mergers, blocking or insisting on important modifications to several high-profile deals.
GE had sought White House support for the deal, and at a news conference Friday in Warsaw, Poland, President
Bush said, "We brought up the proposed merger at the appropriate levels during this trip and before the trip."

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it. The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it," he said.

In Paris, U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans urged the EU Commission to approve the deal, saying a successful deal would be "a positive kind of step for free trade".

"I would encourage (the EU) to think how constructive a merger like this would be," Evans said at a news conference at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
"I must be an eternal optimist," he added. "I'm still hoping they will work out their differences."

GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch, who had led negotiations in the final days in Brussels, has said he considered approval unlikely.

GE, Honeywell  refuse to meet European Union conditions for merger

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The dlrs 41 billion  merger of General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International was edging closer to collapse Friday after the companies refused a belated European Union offer to make more concessions to meet the  antitrust concerns of the 15-nation bloc.
One day after the official deadline for company concessions, EUCommission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said
Friday that both firms still have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals."

A GE spokesman said however, that the companies won't make changes to the divestiture plan they have already submitted, which GE has said did not come close to meeting conditions set by the Commission.
"We will not make another proposal," said the spokesman, Gary Sheffer. "Negotiations are over."

After spending two days in Brussels trying to salvage the deal, GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said the companies could not agree to terms laid down by EU regulators.

"In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined," Welch said Thursday.

Honeywell also said it still wants to merge with GE, but announced it was now considering its future as a stand-alone entity.

Asked about the GE-Honeywell talks Friday during a news conference in Poland, U.S. President George W. Bush said he was "concerned that the Europeans have rejected it" after both U.S. and Canadian regulators approved it.

In Paris, U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans urged the EU Commission to approve the deal, saying a successful deal would be "a positive kind of step for free trade".

"I would encourage (the EU) to think how constructive a merger like this would be," Evans said at a news conference at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
"I must be an eternal optimist," he added. "I'm still hoping they will work out their differences."

United Technologies officials held informal meetings Thursday about the possibility of making a bid for Honeywell, The New York Times reported Friday, citing unidentified sources. United Technologies was in such discussions last fall, but called off the talks after GE emerged as a Honeywell suitor.

The proposal submitted by GE and Honeywell to the European Commission included dlrs 2.2 billion in divestitures.

GE said regulators were demanding billions more in divestitures of virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.
Welch said his company has "always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal."

EU regulators will now pass along details of the GE offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation the European Commission, which will issue a decision by July 12.

Page 47 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But GE said it was not optimistic that its proposal will be approved.
Rejection would kill Welch's vision of combining GE's dominant aircraft engine and servicing business with
Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics for commercial jets and air traffic control systems.

It would also be a personal blow for Welch, who postponed his retirement until the end of 2001 to oversee the merger, which was approved by U.S. regulators in May.

The EU's top antitrust official, Mario Monti, expressed "regret" at the companies' position, but said his office would continue to review the deal "unless the merger notification is formally withdrawn."
Sheffer said GE has no plans to withdraw anything and would wait for the Commission's decision.
GE said its proposal would reduce Honeywell's dlrs 25 billion in revenues by 9 percent, and that combined
GE-Honeywell revenues would decline by about 1.5 percent. Despite the divestitures, GE said anticipated costs
savings of dlrs 3 billion from the merger would remain largely intact.

In a statement late Thursday, Monti said European regulators were still "giving guidance on how best to resolve the remaining competition concerns."

To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by U.S. law to do business in America. An EU decision to block the deal could also spark a trans-Atlantic trade war, as nearly happened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

Europe has become a tougher environment for mergers, with Monti in his two years on the job blocking or requiring substantial modifications to several high-profile deals, including a proposed deal to merge MCI WorldCom and Sprint.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The dlrs 41 billion merger of General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International has been all but called off after the companies refused Europe's demands to cut the size of the combined company.

EU and U.S. regulators had different takes on GE-Honeywell merger

By ALAN CLENDENNING AP Business Writer

NEW YORK (AP) - General Electric  Co. chief executive Jack Welch never thought his career could end on this note: GE's $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International on the verge of collapsing because of  competition concerns from Europe.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the  merger through, was pleased when the U.S. Justice Department gave its blessing to the deal in May.

But after European regulators this past week demanded billions of dollars in divestitures Welch didn't anticipate and would not accept, he said the move made him realize "you are never too old to get surprised."

If the deal is rejected by the European Commission, it would be the first large merger by American companies to be stopped by European regulators following U.S. approval.
Even President Bush, traveling in Europe, expressed his surprise at the outcome.

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it," Bush told reporters at a news conference in Warsaw. "The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it."

But experts said the European response was predictable, given concerns expressed by EU officials that a combined GE-Honeywell could leverage its dominance in aircraft engines into other areas of its business, including aircraft leasing, engine services and aerospace electronics, also known as avionics.

In particular, they feared GE-Honeywell could bundle aircraft-engines and avionics into packages and sell them to Boeing or Airbus at discounts that competitors like Britain's Rolls Royce PLC and France's Thales SA couldn't match.

"I think the European competition is not only trying to protect the competition, it's trying to protect the consumer," said Caglar Ozden, an economics professor at Emory University in Atlanta who specializes in EU antitrust issues. "They're thinking of the best interests of British Airlines and Air France because they are the consumers."

At the heart of the matter are different philosophies in how U.S. and European regulators evaluate the pros and cons of big merger deals, experts say.

"There's no question they have a greater sensitivity to dominant market positions," said Ernest Gellhorn, a law professor at George Mason University. "Our view is that bigness is not bad, as long as what firms are doing is competitive."

EU and U.S. regulators had different takes on GE-Honeywell merger

NEW YORK (AP) - General Electric  Co. chief executive John Welch never thought his career could end on this note: GE's $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International on the verge of collapsing because of  competition concerns from Europe.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the  merger through, was pleased when the U.S. Justice Department gave its blessing to the deal in May.

But after European regulators this past week demanded billions of dollars in divestitures Welch didn't anticipate and would not accept, he said the move made him realize "you are never too old to get surprised."

If the deal is rejected by the European Commission, it would be the first large merger by American companies to be stopped by European regulators following U.S. approval.
Even President Bush, traveling in Europe, expressed his surprise at the outcome.

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it," Bush told reporters at a news conference in Warsaw. "The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it."

But experts said the European response was predictable, given concerns expressed by EU officials that a combined GE-Honeywell could leverage its dominance in aircraft engines into other areas of its business, including aircraft leasing, engine services and aerospace electronics, also known as avionics.

In particular, they feared GE-Honeywell could bundle aircraft-engines and avionics into packages and sell them to Boeing or Airbus at discounts that competitors like Britain's Rolls Royce PLC and France's Thales SA couldn't match.

"I think the European competition is not only trying to protect the competition, it's trying to protect the consumer," said Caglar Ozden, an economics professor at Emory University in Atlanta who specializes in EU antitrust issues. "They're thinking of the best interests of British Airlines and Air France because they are the consumers."

At the heart of the matter are different philosophies in how U.S. and European regulators evaluate the pros and cons of big merger deals, experts say.

"There's no question they have a greater sensitivity to dominant market positions," said Ernest Gellhorn, a law professor at George Mason University. "Our view is that bigness is not bad, as long as what firms are doing is competitive."

GE, Honeywell  refuse to meet European Union conditions for merger

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union regulators suggested more bargaining Friday with General Electric  Co. on its proposed $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International, but  GE insisted the EU must take or leave the last offer.

The deal to create one of the world's largest industrial companies needs  approval  by Europe, but GE and Morris Township, N.J.-based  Honeywell  reaffirmed their willingness to walk away from a merger rather than meet  EU demands that they sell off parts of their companies in the process.

The companies submitted a final proposal Thursday, the formal deadline for making concessions, and acknowledged at the time it was far from what EU regulators wanted.

On Friday, EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said both firms still have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals."

GE's response was immediate: "We will not make another proposal," said company spokesman Gary Sheffer. "Negotiations are over."

EU regulators were worried that the merger would give GE an unfair advantage over some European companies. They will now pass along details of the GE offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission, which will issue a
decision by July 12.

A decision to block the deal could damage trade relations between the United States and Europe, which were threatened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

Europe has become tougher in its review of mergers, blocking or insisting on important modifications to several high-profile deals.
GE had sought White House support for the deal, and at a news conference Friday in Warsaw, Poland, President
Bush said, "We brought up the proposed merger at the appropriate levels during this trip and before the trip."

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it. The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it," he said.

In Paris, U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans urged the EU Commission to approve the deal, saying a successful deal would be "a positive kind of step for free trade".

"I would encourage (the EU) to think how constructive a merger like this would be," Evans said at a news conference at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
"I must be an eternal optimist," he added. "I'm still hoping they will work out their differences."

GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch, who had led negotiations in the final days in Brussels, has said he considered approval unlikely. Honeywell said it was ready with plans to move ahead on its own, but there was immediately speculation that it may renew merger discussions with United Technologies Corp., which had been a suitor until GE moved in.

The proposal submitted by GE and Honeywell to the European Commission included $2.2 billion in divestitures. GE said regulators wanted them to sell off billions more, including nearly all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.

Analysis: European Union's  apparent rejection of a proposed merger between General Electric  and
Honeywell

NOAH ADAMS, host: From NPR News, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Noah Adams.
ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel.
The giant merger of two big American companies, General Electric and Honeywell, appears to have been undone in Europe. GE Chairman Jack Welch spent two days this week in Brussels talking with European Union antitrust officials to try to salvage the deal, but the companies balked at significant concessions demanded by the EU. Today, an EU spokeswoman said that GE could still submit new proposals for a slimmed-down company, but GE said that's not going to happen. NPR's John Ydstie reports.
JOHN YDSTIE reporting:

General Electric, America's largest conglomerate, launched its $41 billion bid for Honeywell with the idea of consolidating its position in the aerospace business. GE is among the largest producers of jet engines, and also among the largest purchasers of aircraft, which it then sells or leases. The company saw Honeywell's strong business in avionics--aircraft controls--as a perfect complement to its product line.
But the merger hit rough air in Europe. According to Don Baker, former head of the US Justice Department's
Antitrust Division, the key problem for GE was a European antitrust concept called `portfolio power,' or bundling.

Mr. DON BAKER (Former Head, US Justice Department Antitrust Division): By which a company that controls related products can use this control to force a transaction--you know, force people to buy.

YDSTIE: The Europeans were concerned that GE and Honeywell would package their combined products in ways that customers couldn't refuse and competitors couldn't match. European officials finally decided that GE must either divest itself of its airline financing business or sell off most of Honeywell's avionics business. GE refused.

Interestingly, US antitrust officials had approved the merger without these demands. Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management and former US undersecretary of Commerce, says that's not surprising because the US and EU view competition issues differently. The US focuses on prices to consumers; the Europeans on making sure that competitors remain healthy. With greater globalization and more mergers among multinational companies, Garten says US antitrust officials will no longer be able to call the shots alone.

Mr. JEFFREY GARTEN (Dean, Yale School of Management): The EU itself has been feeling its oats. It's been consolidating in the monetary area, in the trade area, in the regulatory area. And it has really emerged sort of as an independent force with an independent view about what economic policy, what regulatory policy and, more specifically, antitrust policy ought to be.

YDSTIE: The Europeans made their presence felt in Boeing's merger with McDonnell Douglas and AOL's merger with Time Warner. But if the GE-Honeywell deal is officially rejected--as looks likely now--it would be the first time Europe has scuttled the merger of two American companies.

The Clinton administration had been working with the Europeans to harmonize approaches to antitrust policy. But it may be more difficult for the Bush administration to find common ground with the Europeans, especially if it takes a hands-off approach to antitrust issues.

Page 63 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The apparent failure of the GE-Honeywell merger is a personal blow to GE's legendary chairman, Jack Welch. He postponed his retirement to oversee it. Janet Lowe, who's written two books about Welch, says she thinks the chairman wanted to go out with fireworks.

Ms. JANET LOWE (Author): You know, he really rocked the boat all along, and I think he wanted to go out with some flair. It didn't happen. On the other hand, Welch has always told his managers that if you see a good opportunity take a swing at it. If you swing and miss, you won't be penalized. But you have to have the courage to swing even if it seems like there's some risk involved--there's some risk of failure. And he tried to teach people
not to be afraid of failure.

YDSTIE: Jack Welch now appears to be staring failure in the face himself. The official decision from the EU will come July 12th. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

EU Off'l/Washington - Review Process For GE-Honeywell  Not Over.

WASHINGTON (MktNews) - The  European Union's review process of the proposed  merger between General    Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Corp. will continue, despite the  GE announcement that the proposal is all but dead, an EU official said Friday.

Although the deadline for other companies to step forward with offers for  GE and Honeywell  subsidiaries affected by the EU Competition Commission plan expired Thursday at midnight, the official, who did not wish to be identified, said that the review process will continue until the final deadline of July 12.

"The door is not closed ... but we have those legal, binding deadlines we have to go by," the EU official told reporters.

The official also said that the EU had reservations about the merger because of its antitrust concerns, not because of any bias against innovation or American companies.
"This is not a trade issue; this is an antitrust issue," the official said.

According to the latest plan GE submitted to the EU, its powerhouse Capital Aviation Services division would not be combined with Honeywell's aerospace division, which would have created an especially formidable entity although, as GE has claimed, not one with an overwhelmingly large share of the market. Rather, about $2.2 billion of Honeywell's aerospace business would have been sold off. GE also said that GECAS would operate "at arms length" with Honeywell's aviation business.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said Thursday that the commission was "ready to consider improved commitments" to resolve remaining EU anti-trust concerns. However, GE later announced that because of the commission's rejection of the deal there would be no further proposals submitted, spelling the end of the GE/Honeywell merger.

With prospects for a GE/Honeywell merger dimming fast, Honeywell said Thursday it is ready to continue operations on its own. "While continuing to support the merger, we have a comprehensive contingency plan in place if we must move forward as an independent company," said Honeywell Chairman and CEO Michael Bonsignore.

STOCKS SINKING IN UGLY PROFITS SCENARIO

The daily drumbeat of profit warnings socked stocks again yesterday, and concerns over the likely demise of the
$41 billion GE- Honeywell merger sent chills through the broader market.

Word from GE boss Jack Welch that he'd rather ditch the deal than meet  European regulators' demands to sell off the most attractive parts of  Honeywell  sent the Dow Jones industrial average sinking.

"Ugly, with a capital U," was how Bill Meehan, Cantor Fitzgerald's chief market strategist described yesterday's action.
He said investors have tired of the constant barrage of disappointing corporate forecasts.

"The primary concern now is that the economic recovery won't happen in the original time frame," which was the second half of this year, he said. Now it's more likely the start of the recovery will inch into 2002.

As a result, Meehan cut his closely watched forecast for the Nasdaq's near-term low to 1,520 from an earlier projection of 1,980. After hitting a low, he expects a turnaround.
The Nasdaq plunged 3.7% yesterday, or 77.59, to 2,044.07.

The Dow also tumbled, shaving 1.7%, or 181.49, to 10,690.13, pulled down by Honeywell, which tanked more than 12%, or $5.16, to $37.10.
GE added $1.01 to $48.86, but United Technologies, which could scoop up the pieces from the collapse, sank
$3.16 to $77.10.

Corning fell $1.35, or 8%, to $16, a 52-week low, as Merrill Lynch analysts predicted fiber optic sales would be weak in coming quarters. It shed another 40 cents after-hours.

JDS Uniphase, which warned after the market closed its fourth- quarter revenues would fall below projections, tanked more than 10% in night trading to $12.25, a 52-week low, after falling 37 cents to $13.81 during regular trading.

Telecom equipment maker Lucent continued its descent, dropping 49 cents, or 7%, to $6.75. Its bonds were recently lowered to junk status and yesterday there was speculation a planned sale of two manufacturing plants had fallen through.

The stock market's decline since spring 2000 and dropoff in trading volume took a bite out of discount brokerage Charles Schwab, which said the average number of daily trades fell to a 19-month low. Schwab fell 7.6%, $1.32 to $16.03.

According to Trimtabs, which charts mutual funds, investors pulled $4.9 billion out of stock mutual funds during the past week. A week before, investors added $10.9 billion.

New economic reports also failed to cheer investors - but further solidified the opinion the Fed will cut rates by a quarter percentage point at the end of June as part of its continuing efforts to spur economic growth.

Yesterday, the Labor Department's producer price index, which measures inflation at the wholesale level, crept up a slim 0.1% in May, following a modest 0.3% increase in April.

In another report, the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims fell by 12,000 last week from the prior week, but monthly figures remained high, indicating that lay-offs are continuing.GRAPHIC: SHORT RIDE UP, LONG TRIP DOWN

WELCH'S EXIT IS MARRED BY MARIO: HONEYWELL DEAL, HIS CROWN JEWEL, HITS EU ROADBLOCK

Jack Welch's ride into the sunset was seriously disrupted yesterday as the business legend's planned $41 billion
merger with Honeywell  was all but killed by notorious  European trust buster Mario  Monti.

As yesterday's midnight deadline approached for GE to submit its final offer to the  European Union, it seem unlikely that, even with the power of General Electric  and help from President Bush, Welch would be able to get Europe's populist hero  Monti in line.

If the deal does crater, it will be a giant blow to Welch, who is likely to go down in history as one of the most important leaders of American business. He delayed his retirement to do the deal, which would have sealed his reputation tight and left a stunning legacy.
"This should in no way diminish his reputation. He has become the avatar of American corporate capitalism," said
Argus Research analyst James Kelleher.
But Welch may be suffering on the inside, Kelleher added. "I'm sure he's got a case of buyer's remorse," he said. Others agree Welch's legacy is firmly in place.
"He's going to have to wipe a little egg off his face," said Lawrence White, professor of economics at New York University Stern School of Business. "But he'll survive this experience. He'll still write his book. He'll still get his pension."

President Bush's trade representative, Robert Zoellick, continued to work behind the scenes. But Welch himself expressed doubts that Monti would give his OK.

"GE is not optimistic that its proposal will meet with European regulatory approval," GE said in a stunning announcement that sent Honeywell's stock reeling.

"[GE Chairman-elect and President] Jeff Immelt and I wanted to complete the transaction, but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal. The commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point.
"This shows you are never too old to get surprised," Welch remarked.
Monti, for his part, expressed "regret" at GE's position, but said his office would continue to review the deal
"unless the merger notification is formally withdrawn."
Still, some analysts argue we haven't seen the last of Welch yet.

"Jack's nightmare is to see the GE-Honeywell merger die - and then watch a Honeywell-United Technologies merger live," said one analyst, referring to the industrial conglomerate that made a bid for Honeywell prior to GE's better offer.
"He'll do anything in his power to close this deal," said the analyst. But just what Welch can do to get Monti on his side is unclear.

GE said yesterday it made its "final offer" to the EU. It included $2.2 billion in divestitures in Honeywell's aerospace business

But the company said regulators were demanding more in divestitures of virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.

Monti's office said he was not necessarily seeking "further divestments in the aerospace industry - but rather a commitment to "modify the commercial behavior of GECAS," GE Capital Aviation Services.
Monti cited concerns about the effect on competition of "bundling" GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and
GECAS financing.
GE said it offered to set up GECAS as a separate "ring-fenced" entity to deal at arms length with Honeywell. But that apparently didn't go far enough to satisfy the Commission's Merger Task Force.
The Commission will now pass along the offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment and will make its final recommendation to the full Commission no later than July 12.

$41B MERGER APPEARS DEAD GE, HONEYWELL REJECT DEMANDS SET BY EUROPE

The fate of 125,000  Honeywell  International employees remained on hold Thursday after the Morris
Township-based industrial company and  General Electric  Co. refused to meet  Europe's demands that they pare
down their proposed $41 billion  merger.

Nothing is final, but the refusal to meet demands of  European regulators is expected to end  GE's bid to forge one of the world's largest industrial companies.

Thursday was the last day for the companies to modify their merger plan, and the European Commission must make a final decision by July 12.
The merger already has the approval of American regulators.

If the European Commission rejects the final proposal, Honeywell would remain an independent company, at least for now. That would preserve some jobs in Morris Township. When the merger was announced last year, Honeywell said 550 position in corporate headquarters would be eliminated and thousands of other cuts in operating units were expected.

But the merger would have no effect on 6,500 jobs, including 200 in Morris Township, that Honeywell announced in April that it would eliminate. That move came in response to lower operating profits at each of Honeywell's four major business units and was not related to the GE deal.
The cuts represent about 5 percent of the company's worldwide workforce.

In all, Honeywell has about 1,800 employees in Morris Township, including those in its technical labs and performance polymers and chemical unit.
Investors reacted Thursday by selling Honeywell stock, which dropped $5.16, or 12 percent, to $37.10. Shares in
Fairfield, Conn.- based GE rose $1.01 to $48.86.

Honeywell's future was up in the air Thursday. Before negotiations ended, Michael Bonsignore, the chairman and chief executive, issued a statement saying Honeywell supported GE's filing with the European Commission, but the company also had in place "a comprehensive contingency plan . . . if we must move forward as an independent company."

Bonsignore offered no details. Tom Crane, a company spokesman, said Honeywell was "prepared for any outcome" but was "not commenting beyond what we have in the release."

If the merger falls apart, Honeywell would be forced to go back to operating independently, said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with H. C. Wainwright &Co. in New York.

Since Oct. 22, when the GE deal was announced, "Honeywell was operating as if it were being acquired," he said.
But that independence could be short-term, Lustgarten said.

"Remember, GE was not the only company interested in Honeywell," he said. "If the deal does break, do other companies come out?"

GE entered the Honeywell sweepstakes at the eleventh hour, making a counteroffer just as Honeywell's board of directors was considering an offer from United Technologies Corp.
Tyco International Ltd. and Siemens AG of Germany also were mentioned as potential suitors.

GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch said in a statement Thursday that his company "wanted to complete the transaction but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal."

The proposal the companies submitted to the European Commission in Brussels on Thursday did not come close to meeting conditions set by the commission, Welch said.

The proposal, which includes $2.2 billion in divestitures in Honeywell's aerospace business, was a "final offer," said GE spokesman Gary Sheffer.

Rejection by European regulators would kill Welch's vision of combining GE's dominant aircraft engine and servicing business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics for commercial jets and air traffic control systems.

It also would be a personal blow to Welch, who postponed his retirement until the end of 2001 to oversee the merger.

The European Union's top antitrust official, Mario Monti, expressed "regret" at the companies position, but said his office would continue to review the deal "unless the merger notification is formally withdrawn."
Sheffer said GE has no plans to withdraw the proposal.

The plan would reduce Honeywell's $25 billion in revenues by 9 percent, and combined GE-Honeywell revenues would decline by about 1.5 percent. Despite the divestitures, GE said anticipated cost savings of $3 billion from the merger would remain largely intact.

GE said regulators were demanding billions more in divestitures of virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.

Welch, who in October predicted quick regulatory approval of the sale, said the demands show "you are never too old to get surprised."

"In this case, the European regulators demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined," he said.

Monti said late Thursday that European regulators were still "giving guidance on how best to resolve the remaining competition concerns."

"As I have indicated to Mr. Welch, we were ready to consider improved commitments until the legal deadline" of midnight Thursday in Brussels for concession offers.
But Welch left Brussels on Thursday after a third meeting with Monti in two days.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law, just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business here.
A decision to block the deal also could spark a trans-Atlantic trade war, as nearly happened in 1997 when the EU
raised major objections to Boeing Co.'s impending merger with McDonnell Douglas Corp.

To gain approval from the U.S. Justice Department, Honeywell had to agree to divest its helicopter engine business and authorize new third-party maintenance and repair service for some of its aircraft engines.

Europe has become a tougher environment for mergers. In his two years on the job, Monti has blocked or required substantial modifications to several high-profile deals, including a proposed deal to merge MCI WorldCom and Sprint.

In his statement, Monti said he was not necessarily seeking "further divestments in the aerospace industry but rather a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior of GECAS," GE Capital Aviation Services.

After the midnight deadline, the European Commission will pass along the offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for

* comment. Monti's office then will assess the responses and make its final recommendation to the full commission, which will rule no later than July 12.

White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, traveling with President Bush in Sweden on Thursday, said Welch contacted the White House chief of staff, Andrew Card, about the conflict between GE and European regulators.

"I know they spoke. I can't say specifically if there was a request, what it was. The United States obviously supports the merger," Fleischer said.

Asked whether Welch wanted Bush to press the matter with EU officials, Fleischer said, "I'm not prepared to say that. I don't have that information." Staff Writer Kevin G. DeMarrais e-mail address is demarrais(at)northjersey.com This article contains material from news service reports.

WARSAW, June 15 (AFP) - US President George Bush expressed concern here on Friday at prospects that the European Commission might obstruct a 45-billion-dollar (52-billion-euro) takeover by General Electric  of Honeywell.
"We brought up the proposed  merger at the appropriate level during this trip ... and I am concerned that the

Bush, on his first  European tour, said: "We brought up the proposed  merger at the appropriate level during this trip ... and I am concerned that the  Europeans  have rejected it".
He was speaking during a joint press conference with Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski in Warsaw.

But the European Commission said later it was still examining the proposed deal between the two electronic and aerospace groups, and had until July 12 to make a decision.

"The Commission will release its decision by July 12 at the latest," spokeswoman Amelia Torres told AFP, having indicated on Thursday that such decisions were taken independently of any political pressure.

General Electric had said before a midnight deadline on Thursday that it had made some concessions to meet objections by the commission but believed that these fell far short of changes which the commission wanted.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, however, said later that day: "Unless the merger notification is formally withdrawn, the Commission will continue with the review procedure."

But GE, the world's biggest conglomerate, with interests ranging from aerospace to finance and media, said it was "not optimistic" the result would be in its favour.

The head of GE, Jack Welch, said there was a point beyond which GE and Honeywell were not prepared to see their deal through. "The Commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point," he said.

"In this case, the European regulators demands exceeded anything I or our European advisors imagined, and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the US and Canada."

GE announced its plans to purchase Honeywell last October. US officials have already given a green light the deal, leaving the EU as the last hurdle.

In down-to-the-wire talks in Brussels, Welch offered for GE to divest 2.2 billion dollars' (2.6 billion euros') worth of revenue from Honeywell's aerospace unit, dealing with jet engines and some avionics products, to secure EU approval.
It also suggested "ring fencing" its Gecas (GE Capital Aviation Services) plane-leasing unit, keeping it a
100-percent owned GE subsidiary that would deal at arm's length with Honeywell's main business of avionics.

But Monti has brushed the concessions aside and indicated that he wanted to see a more serious reduction concerning Gecas.
Reports say he wants GE to spin off or sell the hugely profitable unit, because of fears it might preferentially use
Honeywell components to the detriment of competitors, several of which are European.

Honeywell said on Thursday that while it supported GE's moves in Brussels, it has a "contingency plan" should the planned merger be shot down, explaining it was prepared to pursue restructuring plans and continue as an independent company.

EU action on GE-Honeywell merger may fray trade relations

WASHINGTON, June 15 (AFP) - A European Commission probe that may end up blocking the  merger of US conglomerates General Electric  and Honeywell  could exacerbate already strained trade relations between Washington and Europe.

EU and US officials are already at odds over beef and steel trade, and a move by Brussels blocking a  merger
between the two US industrial giants may worsen matters.

US President George W. Bush, on a European tour, voiced concern Friday at prospects that the EU might block the 45-billion-dollar (52-billion-euro) merger, which has already won regulatory approval in the United States.
"We brought up the proposed merger at the appropriate level during this trip ... and I am concerned that the
Europeans have rejected it," Bush said in Warsaw.

GE had said on Thursday, shortly before a midnight deadline, that it had made some concessions to meet objections by the Commission -- the European Union's competition watchdog -- but believed that these fell far short of changes which the Brussels-based body wanted.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, who is due to give a decision on July 12, said Thursday the Commission would continue its probe into the merger unless the companies formally withdrew their notification of the deal.

The action comes in the wake of Bush's decision to launch a probe of steel dumping in the United States, a move described in Europe and elsewhere as protectionist.

US and EU officials recently settled long trade disputes over bananas and wheat gluten, but new row over regulatory matters could inflame matters.

US and European regulators routinely probe mergers outside their jurisdictions when the firms have operations within their territories, and sometimes seek to impose restrictions to limit anti- competitive effects.

Last year, the US Federal Trade Commission opposed the merger of British Oxygen and France's Air Liquide even though it had been approved in Brussels.
And also last year, WorldCom and Sprint abandoned merger plans in the face of European and US opposition. But scuttling the GE-Honeywell deal would mark the first time EU officials kill a merger approved by Washington. Officials say the approach to antitrust matters is often different in Europe and the United States. EU regulators
often are concerned about mergers that reinforce the dominance of a company, while US officials are more
concerned about establishment of a monopoly.
Still, it appeared unlikely that political intervention would save the GE-Honeywell deal.
EU trade commissioner Pascal Lamy said the proposed merger was not discussed at the EU summit.

"Nothing (regarding the merger) was discussed during the meeting," Lamy said at the end of the bilateral meeting in Sweden.

But a Wall Street Journal editorial seemed to take up the campaign for GE, saying that the EU action "highlights the need to bring order to antitrust enforcement before it gets out of hands and undermines the global marketplace."
The editorial said opposition to the merger appears inspired by GE's competitors, and said the commission is
"playing with fire."

The Journal said Brussels should take care not to spark a round of "tit-for-tat corporate sabotage masquerading as antitrust enforcement."

US Commerce Secretary urges EU not to block GE merger

PARIS, June 15 (AFP) - US Commerce Secretary Donald Evans on Friday urged the  European Commission not to block the  merger of US conglomerates  General Electric  (GE) and Honeywell.
The issue threatens to throw a spanner in the works of trade discussions between Washington and the  European
Union and President George Bush on Friday reported his "concern" over the issue.
"I don't want to speculate on what the impact might be if they do block it," Evans told reporters in Paris.

"I want to encourage them to continue to think very thoughtfully and seriously about how constructive such a merger might be for efforts to continue to open up trade around the world."

If the Commission were to go ahead with blocking the proposed merger, as GE has warned that it might, it would be the first time it had stopped a deal between multinationals operating on its territory as well as in the United States and already given the green light in Washington.
Evans said he hoped the Commission would not stop the merger.
"I guess I'm the eternal optimist, I want to continue to think that they'll work out their differences, that they'll be
able to deal with whatever issues are still there on the table and understand that this would be a very positive kind
of step for free trade, as well as a very positive step for people in this region of the world as well as other regions
of the world," he said.

EU/COMPETITION - LAST ATTEMPT BY GENERAL ELECTRIC TO CONVINCE BRUSSELS TO ACCEPT MERGER WITH HONEYWELL.
372 words

(c) 2001 Agence EUROPE, Brussels Not Available for Re-dissemination. .
Brussels, 14/06/2001 (Agence Europe) - The President of  General Electric  (GE) Jack Welsh met on two occasions Commissioner Mario Monti, on Wednesday 13 June, in order to submit undertakings that his group is prepared to make to gain the European go ahead to its  merger with Honeywell.  The tension is especially great for these two companies that only have until midnight in order to present a final offer, which would end the concerns of the  European authorities and, according to information that has filtered down from these meetings, the stakes remain far settled. According to sources close to the dossier,  GE has proposed several concessions to the Commission:

a) the sale of a package of activities including avionics equipment, aircraft engines for regional transportation, auxiliary engines for ignition and specialised alarm system, activities representing an annual global turnover of USD 2.1 billion;
b) the holding of separate accounting for GE Capital Aviation services (Gecas), the aircraft leasing subsidiary of
GE and the creation of an independent committee responsible for ensuring the monitoring;

c) the nomination of independent Directors to Gecas. According to the same sources, the Commission is pushing the parties to the merger for greater efforts in additional sell-off or even the flat rate sale of Gecas, subsidiary that is the focus of the Commission's fears (see EUROPE of 8 June, p.12). For the time being, the opinions are mitigated as to the positive end of this operation, one side feeling that the divergences of opinions are too great to reach a compromise that satisfies everybody, the other feeling that much progress has been accomplished and that it is necessary to be optimist. It will be necessary to wait until next 12 July to know the Commission's final decision.

Robert Zoellick, the US trade representative accompanying President Bush during his visit to Europe, seized the opportunity to point out that "the United States has a strong interest in fair treatment" of this merger by the Europeans. He stressed, moreover, that relations between the American and European antitrust authorities were "an example, frankly, of a partnership that's been pretty effective".

BRUSSELS --  General Electric  Co. has all but walked away from its $41 billion (48.05 billion euro) bid for Honeywell  International Inc. The deal's collapse would mark the first time that the European Commission has prohibited a merger between two American companies that has been  approved  in the U.S.

While there's a small chance  GE and the commission could still reach a compromise, both sides dismiss that goal as almost unattainable.

The apparent undoing of the world's biggest company's most ambitious acquisition signals that globalization has rendered big U.S. mergers highly vulnerable to European antitrust scrutiny -- and could strain the relationship between antitrust authorities in Brussels and Washington.

From the beginning, GE's negotiators and the commission's Merger Task Force disagreed about the antitrust implications of a deal that could have reshaped the global aerospace industry. Moreover, GE's negotiators have viewed the task force as a group of overzealous regulators who relied on shaky economic theories in their
analysis of the merger. The commission, for its part, thought GE consistently ignored legitimate antitrust concerns and refused to offer substantial concessions until very late in the investigation.

The philosophical gulf between the two sides grew so wide on Thursday that GE issued an unprecedented statement in which Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Welch Jr. admitted to having underestimated the tenacity of the task force. "This shows you are never too old to get surprised," said Mr. Welch, who decided to stay on at the helm of GE to close his career-capping acquisition of Honeywell. "Jeff Immelt (Mr. Welch's
designated successor at GE) and I wanted to complete the transaction but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do it. The commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point." European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti responded within an hour with a statement of his own, in which he
laments GE's alleged tardiness in responding to the commission's concerns.
Boiled down, the commission's concern is that GE will be able to extend its powerful position in the large
jet-engine market into a possible dominance of a related industry supplying crucial flight equipment. Honeywell is
one of the strongest players in this market. Moreover, the commission is worried that GE's Capital Aviation
Services, or Gecas -- a powerful aircraft financing and leasing business -- will be able to use market power to
sway airlines and other customers to choose GE-Honeywell's equipment and thus sideline rival companies. The
commission has alleged that Gecas is already using such tactics to promote GE's jet engine to the detriment of
competing brands made by British company Rolls Royce PLC and United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney
unit, a U.S. company. Honeywell's main competitors, also spread between Europe and the U.S., include Thales
SA of France and Rockwell International Corp.'s Rockwell-Collins division, a U.S. company. The fact that the
biggest beneficiaries of GE-Honeywell's apparent derailment are evenly spread between the U.S. and Europe
deprives the commission's critics of an easy attack strategy -- that the commission was trying to protect European
companies against American competition.

After several meetings with Mr. Monti, Mr. Welch offered to have the merged company divest itself of Honeywell businesses totaling $2.2 billion in annual sales and also proposed to ring-fence Gecas within GE's existing corporate structure. Neither offer went far enough for Brussels regulators, who deemed them insufficient and hardly enforceable.

While GE's negotiators complain about what they say are the commission's unreasonable demands, the merger task force says GE's proposed divestitures were "carve-outs" from Honeywell's core business and would therefore stand little chance of being viable independent businesses.

The U.S. Department of Justice has approved the merger, and critics say this is proof enough that the commission was pursuing shaky economic theories in its attack on the deal. The commission, though, says that GE rivals were reluctant to complain in the U.S. because they didn't want to go on the record and potentially be called to testify in court; in the commission's eye they were simply too scared to speak up in court against so powerful a company. The European Union's merger-control procedures allow the complainant a greater degree of anonymity.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Welch Meets Monti

An epic quality has come to  GE's battle to get the Honeywell  acquisition approved  by European regulators, which after the latest meeting between Jack Welch and European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti seems all but kaput. The drama highlights the need to bring order to antitrust enforcement before it gets out of hand and undermines the global marketplace.

By nature, Europeans  seem disinclined to view the property rights of companies as any kind of inhibition against regulators doing whatever they please. In the  Honeywell  case, novel antitrust theories have been dreamed up simply because it would be unthinkable to let a large U.S. company go about its business unmolested. What might have given enforcers pause in any responsible jurisdiction is that opposition to the  GE-Honeywell merger comes almost entirely from  GE's competitors.

It would be hard to exaggerate the ludicrousness of this. When a firm's rivals complain about a deal being "anticompetitive," obviously they mean the opposite, that it would produce benefits for customers that they'd have to respond to.

Commissioner Monti's official challenge to the Honeywell buyout reportedly lifts whole passages from a brief by Rolls Royce, GE's rival in aircraft engines. What fills the competition with dread is the possibility that GE might package engines and Honeywell avionics under terms buyers would find attractive. Quelle horreur. This is called standardization, a hallmark of efficiency and industrial progress for 200 years. But we guess the idea is to block innovation because it might discomfit a competitor who prefers an unchanging world, requiring no effort to adapt. This is typical of monopolists and cartels, but seems to be the EC's ideal of "competition."

Mr. Monti's office also tried to rework GE's relationship with its aircraft-leasing arm, which commands a mere 10% of the relevant market. GECAS's business is not directly implicated in the merger, but the commission apparently saw an opportunity to take a customer away from GE engines and redistribute its business to GE's rivals.

This is foolish and, in some sense, corrupt, at least if the Commission pretends to base its positions on economic analysis. U.S. antitrust at times has also been an interest group pinata, but its silly and arbitrary actions are dissected by courts and lawyers, with the result that sophisticated, skeptical analysis has advanced.

The European Commission seems beyond reason at this point, with nothing to fear from judicial review and having picked a popular punching bag in GE, icon of what many continentals affect to find disturbing about "Anglo-American" capitalism. But attentive European pols and business leaders should at least be open to self-interest.

The nearest parallels to the way the Commission deliberates about antitrust are the occasional jags of the U.S. Congress, such as the one that nearly sank Deutsche Telekom's recent acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless. Alcatel lately was sniffing around Lucent. Germany's Bertelsmann, France's Vivendi and other European firms with global aspirations consider freedom to make acquisitions in the U.S. market, protected by U.S. laws, essential to their hopes. They should be letting Mr. Monti know he's playing with fire.

We should also note that Mr. Monti's office has become a regular stopping place for U.S. firms seeking help to stymie their competitors. Microsoft's enemies are as busy in Brussels as they are in Washington. And Pratt & Whitney, outbid by GE for Honeywell, now works the hallways of the Brussels bazaar to thwart its rival.

Seventy years ago, trade warfare plunged the world into a depression and global conflagration. Nowadays, trade is still important, but the vast preponderance of international economic activity is actually the investment and

marketing efforts of thousands of multinational firms -- U.S., Canadian, European, Japanese, soon to be joined by a growing horde of global companies based in what we used to think of as "developing" countries.

Nothing would roll up today's healthy, peaceful progress of the world economy faster than tit-for-tat corporate sabotage masquerading as antitrust enforcement. This is the risk Europe runs with its prolonged torture and apparent killing of the GE-Honeywell deal.

EU's demands threaten GE-Honeywellmerger; Welch says insistence on divesting $6 billion in assets is
too tough

General Electric  Co.'s $45 billion bid to buy Honeywell  International appeared seriously jeopardized Thursday after the companies said the  European Union's antitrust authorities had set intolerable conditions for the deal.

The possibility that the  EU may effectively veto the combination of two U.S. industrial giants threatened to create economic tensions between the United States and  Europe just as President Bush was holding a summit meeting with the 15  EU leaders in Gothenburg, Sweden.

If the EU blocks the deal, it would mark the first time European regulators foiled a merger of two American companies that had already been approved by the U.S. government.
Executives for both companies said they'd gone as far as they could to appease EU concerns by offering to divest
Honeywell businesses that generate $2.2 billion in annual revenue.

The EU executive commission wants them to dispose of $6 billion in assets, which the companies consider exorbitant.

"We have always said there was a point at which we wouldn't do the deal," said GE's chairman and chief executive, Jack Welch.
"The commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point."

Welch, who traveled to Brussels last week hoping to salvage the deal, said the EU's demands would require sacrificing virtually all of Honeywell's avionics business and rob the merger of its original strategic purpose.

"In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the U.S. and Canada," who have approved the deal, Welch said.

EU antitrust regulators, who have authority to review the deal because of the large European presence of both companies, have demanded that the companies divest various assets to reduce the likelihood they will dominate certain global aerospace markets.
EU antitrust commissioner Mario Monti and his staff have repeatedly warned about the dangers of GE and
Honeywell "bundling" the sales and services of its different businesses.

For example, GE Capital Aviation Services, the largest aircraft-leasing company, might buy only GE jet engines and Honeywell aerospace products. This combination, the EU commission fears, would produce package deals for commercial jet airplanes that would annihilate the competition and lead to much higher prices.
The companies had until midnight Thursday to submit their final concession offers.

The EU's executive members must decide whether to approve the merger by July 12. Many antitrust experts predict the companies will withdraw their merger proposal.

Some industry analysts believe that GE, after rethinking the deal and considering the U.S. economy's slowdown, isn't unhappy. "It's very, very possible GE has set terms it knows won't be accepted," said James Kelleher, analyst at Argus Research.
Pressure mounts

With the U.S. and EU struggling to resolve a raft of trade conflicts at a time of growing weakness in the world economy, some Europeans expressed fears that an EU veto of the merger could anger members of the U.S. Congress.

A White House spokesman confirmed that White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card had spoken with Welch about the matter while the Bush delegation was in Brussels on Wednesday for a summit with NATO leaders.
The spokesman said the Bush administration might raise the merger issue at the summit.

Monti's spokeswoman Amelia Torres said pressures from the U.S. or any other foreign government would have little impact.

"As to political intervention, that's something that can happen and has happened in the past, but it really never impresses the commission," Torres said.
"The commission must review mergers and acquisitions solely based on competition grounds," she said. "That's always what the commission has done and that's what it intends to keep doing."
Until now, U.S. and EU antitrust officials have collaborated closely in policing the competitive impact of mergers as a growing number of companies combine to compete on a global scale.

But the divergent views of the GE-Honeywell merger by regulators on either side of the Atlantic could portend new uncertainties for future mergers.

Monti and Welch met twice Wednesday, but the talks made no headway, according to sources familiar with the discussions.

GE executives said Thursday they had offered to set up GE Capital Aviation Services, or GECAS, as "as a separate, `ring-fenced' entity to deal at arms length with Honeywell avionics and non-avionics products."
But the EU's merger task force demands a full spin-off, a condition GE claims is a deal-breaker. Document MLWK000020100320dx6f02cor

GE, Honeywell  Won't Meet EU Demands

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union regulators suggested more bargaining Friday with General Electric  Co. on its proposed $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International, but  GE insisted the EU must take or leave the last offer.

The deal to create one of the world's largest industrial companies needs  approval  by Europe, but GE and Honeywell  reaffirmed their willingness to walk away from a  merger rather than meet EU demands that they sell off parts of their companies in the process.

The companies submitted a final proposal Thursday, the formal deadline for making concessions, and acknowledged at the time it was far from what EU regulators wanted.

On Friday, EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said both firms still have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals."

GE's response was immediate: "We will not make another proposal," said company spokesman Gary Sheffer. "Negotiations are over."

EU regulators were worried that the merger would give GE an unfair advantage over some European companies. They will now pass along details of the GE offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission, which will issue a
decision by July 12.

A decision to block the deal could damage trade relations between the United States and Europe, which were threatened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

Europe has become tougher in its review of mergers, blocking or insisting on important modifications to several high-profile deals.
GE had sought White House support for the deal, and at a news conference Friday in Warsaw, Poland, President
Bush said, "We brought up the proposed merger at the appropriate levels during this trip and before the trip."

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it. The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it," he said.

In Paris, U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans urged the EU Commission to approve the deal, saying a successful deal would be "a positive kind of step for free trade".

"I would encourage (the EU) to think how constructive a merger like this would be," Evans said at a news conference at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
"I must be an eternal optimist," he added. "I'm still hoping they will work out their differences."

GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch, who had led negotiations in the final days in Brussels, has said he considered approval unlikely. Honeywell said it was ready with plans to move ahead on its own, but there was immediately speculation that it may renew merger discussions with United Technologies Corp., which had been a suitor until GE moved in.

The proposal submitted by GE and Honeywell to the European Commission included $2.2 billion in divestitures. GE said regulators wanted them to sell off billions more, including nearly all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.

Surprises in GE-Honeywell Merger

By ALAN CLENDENNING AP Business Writer

NEW YORK (AP) - General Electric  Co. chief executive Jack Welch never thought his career could end on this note: GE's $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International on the verge of collapsing because of  competition concerns from Europe.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the  merger through, was pleased when the U.S. Justice Department gave its blessing to the deal in May.

But after European regulators this past week demanded billions of dollars in divestitures Welch didn't anticipate and would not accept, he said the move made him realize "you are never too old to get surprised."

If the deal is rejected by the European Commission, it would be the first large merger by American companies to be stopped by European regulators following U.S. approval.
Even President Bush, traveling in Europe, expressed his surprise at the outcome.

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it," Bush told reporters at a news conference in Warsaw. "The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it."

But experts said the European response was predictable, given concerns expressed by EU officials that a combined GE-Honeywell could leverage its dominance in aircraft engines into other areas of its business, including aircraft leasing, engine services and aerospace electronics, also known as avionics.

In particular, they feared GE-Honeywell could bundle aircraft-engines and avionics into packages and sell them to Boeing or Airbus at discounts that competitors like Britain's Rolls Royce PLC and France's Thales SA couldn't match.

"I think the European competition is not only trying to protect the competition, it's trying to protect the consumer," said Caglar Ozden, an economics professor at Emory University in Atlanta who specializes in EU antitrust issues. "They're thinking of the best interests of British Airlines and Air France because they are the consumers."

At the heart of the matter are different philosophies in how U.S. and European regulators evaluate the pros and cons of big merger deals, experts say.

"There's no question they have a greater sensitivity to dominant market positions," said Ernest Gellhorn, a law professor at George Mason University. "Our view is that bigness is not bad, as long as what firms are doing is competitive."

EU officials prefer to deal with perceived anticompetitive aspects of deals before approval is granted so enforcement isn't necessary, said Mark Powell, an antitrust lawyer with White & Case in Brussels, Belgium, where the EU Commission is based

But U.S. officials tend not to worry as much before mergers, knowing they can take legal action against the combined companies after antitrust issues emerge.

U.S. regulators also tend to look favorably on cost savings through mergers because increased profits are passed on to shareholders, said Peter Tague, a managing director with Citigroup Inc.'s Schroders Salomon Smith Barney in London who specializes in trans-Atlantic mergers and acquisitions.
Page 94 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The EU can tend to view cost savings as an indication that you have created an increasingly dominant market player, which is an inherently undesirable outcome - because they will ultimately exert market power which increases prices and puts customers into a weaker position," Tague said.

Tague and others predicted the objections to the GE-Honeywell deal will deter mergers by American companies who do business in Europe.

But some said Welch should have realized early on that big obstacles could have emerged in Europe that didn't come up when the company was seeking approval from U.S. regulators.
"This whole case has been an elaborate journey that I think GE didn't anticipate embarking on," Powell said. Added Tague: "The European Commission is not out of step. They're just walking to a different drumbeat." AP-GE-Honeywell-Regulators; D7CL5PTO0

Honeywell merger news jolts Bay, Wall streets Key indexes drop on fears GE deal won't be approved

News that the proposed marriage between  General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. may have hit the skids led Bay and Wall Streets on a downward ride.

GE said before the opening bell that European regulators may not accept its latest proposal to try to win
approval  for its planned $41-billion (U.S.) merger with the aerospace blue-chip company.

Honeywell shares -- a component of the Dow Jones industrial average -- tumbled on the news, shedding 12.21 per cent to close at $37.10. GE finished 2.11-per-cent higher at $48.86.
The Dow, meanwhile, lost 181.49 points to 10,690.13.

The Honeywell-GE news came as Wall Street battled a slew of second-quarter profit warnings. Companies ranging from ketchup giant H.J. Heinz Co. to electronic parts maker CTS Corp. warned that results will lag estimates because of the economic downturn.
The Nasdaq Stock Market's technology-heavy composite index lost 77.59 points to 2,044.07, while the Standard
& Poor's 500-stock index slipped 21.73 points to 1,219.87.
On Bay Street, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock composite index lost 92.69 points to 7,920.05.

Nortel Networks Corp. fell 47 cents (Canadian) to $16.23 -- another 21/2-year low, in the wake of this week's string of downbeat analysts' reports.

"I guess the feeling is the economic recovery is not imminent in the third or fourth quarter," said Ted Oberhaus, manager of equity trading at Lord Abbett & Co. in Jersey City, N.J. "When you hear the European Central Bank is lowering growth forecasts and the Japanese economy is deteriorating -- that doesn't bode well."

Meanwhile, the U.S. producer price index rose 0.1 per cent in May on a month-over-month basis, with the core rate -- which excludes food and energy prices -- up by 0.2 per cent. Both figures came in lower than analysts had expected.

Canadian and American consumer price index reports -- the broadest gauge of inflation -- are to be released today.

GE, Honeywell  refuse European merger terms Regulators were demanding billions of dollars  in
divestitures.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The $41 billion merger of General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International has been all but called off after the companies refused Europe's demands to cut the size of the combined company.

GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said Thursday he still wants to go forward with the  merger and form one of the world's largest industrial companies but could not agree to the terms.

"In this case, the European regulators demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined," Welch said after speaking three times with top European Commission antitrust regulators.

Honeywell also said it still wants to merge with GE, but announced it was now considering its future as a stand-alone entity.

"We have a comprehensive contingency plan in place if we must move forward as an independent company," said Honeywell's chairman and CEO, Michael R. Bonsignore.

The proposal the companies submitted to the European Commission included $2.2 billion in divestitures but did not come close to meeting conditions set by the commission, Welch said.

GE said regulators were demanding billions more in divestitures of virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.
Welch said his company has "always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal." GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company's offer was final.
EU regulators will now pass along details of the offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for
comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation the European Commission, which will issue a
decision by July 12.
But GE said it was not optimistic that its proposal will be approved.
Rejection would kill Welch's vision of combining GE's dominant aircraft engine and servicing business with
Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics for commercial jets and air traffic control systems.

It would also be a personal blow for Welch, who postponed his retirement until the end of 2001 to oversee the merger, which was approved by U.S. regulators in May.

The EU's top antitrust official, Mario Monti, expressed "regret" at the companies' position, but said his office would continue to review the deal "unless the merger notification is formally withdrawn."
Sheffer said GE has no plans to withdraw the proposal.
GE said its proposal would reduce Honeywell's $25 billion in revenues by 9 percent, and that combined
GE-Honeywell revenues would decline by about 1.5 percent. Despite the divestitures, GE said anticipated costs
savings of $3 billion from the merger would remain largely intact.

In a statement late Thursday, Monti said European regulators were still "giving guidance on how best to resolve the remaining competition concerns."
But Welch left Brussels Thursday after talking with Monti for the third time.

Interview  With Jeffrey Gedmin

Fox News: Special Report with Brit Hume
HUME

HUME: Earlier this week, Swedish prime minister Goran Persson, who is also the current president of the European Union, said the  EU is, quote, "one of the few institutions we can develop as a balance to U.S. world domination." Never mind that neutral Sweden has lived under the U.S. nuclear umbrella that protected Western Europe from Soviet world domination for a half century. Such anti-American thinking is nothing new in  Europe, but it seems on the rise these days, much on display during the Bush visit to Europe and seemingly exemplified, as well, by the  EU's blocking of the  merger of General Electric  and Honeywell,  two American companies whose marriage had been approved  by the U.S. government.
So what's going on? For an explanation, we turn to Jeffrey Gedmin, executive director of the New Atlantic
Initiative at the American Enterprise Institute.
Welcome. Nice to have you.
JEFFREY GEDMIN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Brit, thank you. A pleasure to be here.

HUME: What is your sense of -- is there really a rise in anti- American sentiment, or is it just more visible? What's going on?

GEDMIN: Well, I think first you have to put it in context. We're looking now and we Americans belatedly are realizing we're facing a Western Europe, a European Union that is less dependent on the United States, and they feel it. And it changes the character of the relationship.
HUME: That's because of the military -- they don't need us militarily as much.
GEDMIN: They don't need us militarily. That's changed objectively the relationship in important ways. HUME: Although they were certainly in no hurry -- they didn't want to see us leave the Balkans.
GEDMIN: No. The point is, the mortal threat is gone. The Soviet Union is gone. But there are a range of things that they cannot do without us, and teamwork is important. On anti-Americanism, I think we should be careful. The old kind, burning flags in the street -- that's gone, or we've seen it on the fringe in small numbers in Europe through protests.

The new form -- it may be anti-Americanism. Maybe call it Euro- nationalism. It's a sense among EU or West European elites that we're bigger, we're stronger, we have a little bit of a hormone problem. There's the United States, which we envy, which we resent, and want to balance things out. There's a partner of ours, but increasingly, they see us as a bloc that they want to rival and compete with.
HUME: Now, is there -- what is it that they fear about the United States, if anything?

GEDMIN: I think there's nothing, in general, that they should fear, Brit, because we are a peaceful democratic power that still extends security in a fundamental way to our European allies. At the same time, I think it's a combination of envy, resentment, jealousy and the fact that the EU's growing up. I mean, part of it's inevitable. They should be more self-reliant today. They want that, and we want that. But there's this line that could be crossed, where the EU not only wants to be more self- reliant but defines itself in opposition to the U.S.

You read a quotation by the Swedish leader this week. The idea of balancing the U.S. -- we're used to hearing that from Chinese leaders or Russian leaders.
HUME: Right.
Page 101 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GEDMIN: But our closest allies? That doesn't make us feel very comfortable.

HUME: No, and -- let me just ask you for a reaction to the -- to the Bush visit and -- and -- I mean, obviously, a new American president is always tested, to some extent. Even -- even President Bush's father was, even though he was a well-known figure...
GEDMIN: Right.

HUME: ... there and knew all those guys and -- and of course, had Mrs. Thatcher at his side, as did President Reagan. How do you think it went, though, based on what -- how it was -- how it could have gone, so far, anyway?

GEDMIN: Look, on balance, I think it's OK. The sky is not falling. But I would like to see our president have a little warmer reception. After all, cold war over, peacetime, a lot of good things going on on the relationship. And what I sense, as an American, or watching from here, is a prickliness, the prickliness over the death penalty, the prickliness over Kyoto, the prickliness over missile defense. We have divisions, but there's a prickliness that we feel today that says there's something slightly oppositional going on in the European and ethos, I think.

HUME: Now, on -- on Kyoto -- how much of what we're seeing there is hypocrisy, in the sense that it's been, what, four years since that treaty...
GEDMIN: Right.
HUME: ... was negotiated, or longer. And not a single one of those countries in the EU has ratified it. GEDMIN: That's correct.
HUME: And yet they're complaining because we don't want -- we're not going to do it. What's up there? Is that... GEDMIN: That's right.
HUME: Is it -- is -- is that an unfair criticism... GEDMIN: But I think...
HUME: ... it's hypocrisy...

GEDMIN: ... it's partially fair. I think it's a mix of things. I think there's little bit of hypocrisy, but I think the truth is, the Europeans, by and large, do see this process, protocol and approach to global climate change differently than we do. And I have to say, on this issue, I think the Bush policy is better than the explanation. And I wish we had been a little cleverer early on, and rather than trashing the treaty, said, "Look, we have fundamental problems. This doesn't work for us. Let's talk about it." I'm afraid our confrontational approach created this sort of backlash. I think the policy is probably right. We're probably hurting a little bit because the approach could have been smoother on our part.
HUME: Now, let's turn to missile defense. He picked up some favorable comments. GEDMIN: Yes, he did.
HUME: Of course, Tony Blair's with him on that. Aznar appears to be. Berlusconi in Italy will be. GEDMIN: That's right. The conservatives.
HUME: The Poles were. Yeah. GEDMIN: The former communist... HUME: Right. The former...
GEDMIN: ... countries and the conservatives are with him. HUME: And the conservatives.
GEDMIN: That's right.


Page 102 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
HUME: I assume all the success or failure on that issue will hinge on the Putin meeting.

GEDMIN: I think it'll be a big part of it. I think, oddly enough, Putin knows that. Why should he be holding such cards 12 years after the fall of the Berlin wall? But he is. It's a strange thing, and I put this in the context that you're asking, euro-nationalism, anti-Americanism. Remember, Brit, it used to be that the Europeans fretted and protested when Americans wanted to put offensive weapons on European soil.
HUME: Right.

GEDMIN: Today they're worried about American defensive weapons on American soil. It's a strange calculation, when you think about it. I think that the West Europeans need to think, regardless of what happens with Putin, we have to work this out as Western allies. That comes first, and then we deal with the Russians second. I think
that's the important sequence.
HUME: But it appears it's not going to -- going to -- that won't be the sequence.

GEDMIN: It appears it won't because the Europeans, whose opposition started to wither a little bit, recalculated, it appears, a little bit when the composition of the Senate changed. When they saw that it wasn't perhaps as inevitable, resistance got as second wind, I think, in Western Europe.

HUME: Now, politically at home, how does this -- in your -- if you can tell, for the president, how does this play? He's standing -- he's over there sticking up for his own agenda, which...
GEDMIN: Which is important. HUME: Which is...
GEDMIN: And he should. HUME: Right. But...
GEDMIN: He should point for point.
HUME: ... does this -- does this play as the president not doing well with our allies or president sticking up for
America?

GEDMIN: Good question. I hope it means president sticking up for America. I hope it doesn't mean, which may, in fact, be the case, why is Western Europe being slightly inhospitable to a president who comes wanting on a lot of issues, like global climate change, also missile defense --we stopped talking about national missile defense because the Europeans didn't like it. Now we talk broadly about ballistic missile defense to include them, and they're still upset about it.
HUME: Gotcha. All right, very interesting. Jeffrey Gedmin... GEDMIN: Great pleasure.
HUME: ... very good to have you. Hope you'll come back.

Evan Bayh of Indiana says about a run for the White House. "The Grapevine" is next.

Outlook  - Brussels fails to respond  to Jack's neutron  bomb.

THE CHAIRMAN of  General Electric  is known as Jack "Neutron" Welch for a good reason. Yesterday he went positively ballistic. The mild-mannered European Competition Commissioner, Mario Monti, has in all
probability put the kibosh on  GE's $42bn takeover of Honeywell  and the Americans just can't believe it. It was the largest industrial  merger ever attempted, and it was also meant to be Mr Welch's swansong.

Why, he asks, is Brussels playing hardball when the deal has already been waved through by the anti-trust authorities in the US and Canada? Politics may have played a part. There is a good deal more antipathy towards the new American administration on the Continent than here and it may be more than coincidence that Brussels has slapped GE in the face just as President Bush conducts his first tour of  Europe.

But there are also some powerful anti-trust arguments for blocking the deal. A merger of GE and Honeywell would allow the two companies to bundle their product lines together and so gain an important and perhaps unfair advantage in the aerospace market. A merger might also have ensured that GE's aircraft leasing subsidiary,
which buys one in 10 of all new planes, ensured that they came equipped with Honeywell avionics as well as GE
engines.

In many other industries such a bundling together of complimentary products under one roof wouldn't matter very much. Indeed, it is the rationale which drives many takeovers. But aero-engines is an exception. There are only three players of any significance in the world, and GE is already the dominant one. Barriers to entry are so high that there is no danger of it ever facing new competition.

The US Justice Department was apparently relaxed at the prospect of an all-embracing aerospace group with a wingspan covering everything from engines to aircraft systems. But it is easy to see why there was alarm elsewhere. Rolls-Royce has fought hard to dig its way back from receivership three decades ago to the point where it is now a genuine competitor to GE and firmly established as the world's number two aero-engine company. The GE-Honeywell deal could have undermined that.

This is not the first time, of course, Brussels has rudely intervened in what the US assumed was an all-American affair. The Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger only went through after Commissioner Monti's predecessor had extracted some big concessions. Then, as now, the US complained bitterly. But the lesson remains the same. Global companies that recognise no national borders need to be kept in check by regulators with a similar sweep. In the twilight of his career, Jack Welch has been forced to learn it the hard way.

Slump continues on back of bad US profits news.

More bad news on corporate profits from the US and some disturbing domestic economic data ensured another bad session for the London stock market yesterday. A profits warning from food manufacturer HJ Heinz allied to fears that the  General Electric-Honeywell merger might fall through because of  European regulatory concerns, combined to send Wall Street lower in early trading. By the London close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 130 points and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped more than 50 points.
The FTSE 100 index was dragged down in the afternoon by Wall Street's weakness, hitting a low of 5,734.6, off
85.6. Even a late recovery still left the blue-chip benchmark 67.7 points down at the close at 5,752.5. The index
has lost nearly 200 points this week and hopes of a bounce-back through 6,000 seem to have been dashed in the
short term. The London market was in the red even before the bad news had filtered through from Wall Street.
Retail sales figures for May were much stronger than expected, showing a 0.8 per cent rise on the month and a
6.4 per cent gain on the year. The figures appeared to confirm the impression of a two-tier economy in which the
manufacturing sector continued to struggle but consumer demand remained strong.

After the higher-than-expected inflation data released earlier this week, investors are increasingly taking the view that the bottom of the interest rate cycle may have been reached. The interest rate outlook was one reason why sentiment in London was depressed, but there was also talk that KPN, the Dutch telecoms group, was about to place its stake in Vodafone. Shares in the mobile telecoms company fell 4.2 per cent to a two-year low. Other telecoms such as Colt Telecom, also suffered.

The technology stocks came under further pressure, as French chip-maker STMicroelectronics followed up Tuesday's profit warning from Nokia with its own gloomy forecast. The Techmark 100 index fell heavily again, dropping 63.55 to 1,890.52. Autonomy and Psion both suffered double-digit losses. The pain in the market was widely spread, with the FTSE 250 down 79.4 at 6,453.7 and the SmallCap off 18.2 at 3,108.2.

Heard on the Street
Takeover Traders Are Battered By GE-Honeywell  Deal Fallout

Ouch.

Already hurt by a big slowdown in merger-and-acquisition activity, traders who invest in takeover stocks have been battered by the standoff between General Electric  Chairman John F. Welch Jr. and Mario  Monti, Europe's chief antitrust regulator.

Takeover experts estimate that the takeover-trading, or risk-arbitrage, community has lost more than $1 billion in the past two weeks due to the growing expectations that GE's proposed acquisition of Honeywell International will fall apart. That is a far cry from an average 30% annualized rate of return that had been anticipated when they purchased the shares.

It is the latest blow in a year that has fallen far short of the stellar results seen in recent years when the stock market was booming and the pace of mergers was blistering. Takeover experts estimate arbitragers own between
80 million and 100 million shares of Honeywell. Takeover arbitragers make their money by betting on the likelihood that a proposed merger will be completed. In this deal, the "arbs" snapped up Honeywell shares on the hopes that the deal would be completed on terms announced in October.
"Obviously, this has been very painful. The losses are going to be very big," said Tom Burnett, president of
Merger Insight, an institutional research service.
The growing concerns about the future of the $41 billion deal reached new heights when Mr. Welch
acknowledged for the first time that he wasn't optimistic that the company's $2.2 billion divestiture proposal would
pass European regulatory muster.

At 4 p.m. yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Honeywell was down $5.16 at $37.10, while General Electric was up $1.01 at $48.86. Some traders held on to their Honeywell shares on the hopes that another bidder will step in.

Mr. Monti, the European competition commissioner, has until July 12 to make a decision on the deal, but many takeover experts viewed the transaction as nearly dead.

The development sent the deal's so-called spread -- the difference between Honeywell's stock price and the implied value of the GE stock that Honeywell shareholders would receive -- soaring to $14.45, from a spread of about $2.80 just last month. Arbitragers make money when the spread narrows to zero.

The widening differential between the nominal price shareholders would receive and where Honeywell shares are trading signals that there is a growing belief that the transaction has an increased risk of unraveling.

The GE-Honeywell deal is the latest transaction that has disappointed takeover traders this year. In March, for example, Tyson Foods canceled a planned $3.2 billion acquisition of IBP. And traders fretted for months over the outcome of Deutsche Telekom's purchase of VoiceStream Wireless, although that deal has been completed.

As of May 31, the average fund managed by takeover traders rose 4.83% this year compared with an 8.98% gain for the year-earlier period, according to Van Hedge Fund Advisors International Inc., Nashville, Tenn.


Page 106 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But traders said the potential fallout from a collapse of the GE-Honeywell deal would eclipse previous losses. "There's a lot of blood out there. People had it among their larger positions because they thought there was a large probability the deal would get done," one takeover trader said.

Indeed, it was the very words of Mr. Welch that gave many arbitragers comfort when the deal was unveiled in October -- even though some experts predicted antitrust problems. Mr. Welch, who delayed his retirement to oversee the integration of Honeywell, said he didn't anticipate any antitrust issues.

Takeover traders also were optimistic about the likely outcome of the deal because it had already received approval from the U.S. Justice Department, which ordered only minor concessions. But the European regulatory agency has increasingly played hardball in recent months, even on transactions such as this one involving two U.S.-based firms.

Traders were reluctant to discuss their own losses or rumored losses at rival firms. Some of the damage, however, may have been minimized because the spread had been widening over the past week and that would provide an opportunity for traders to protect their vulnerable positions.

Indeed, arbitragers said that is exactly what happened with San Francisco hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, which held 4.7 million Honeywell shares in the first quarter, according to a Honeywell shareholder list filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These arbs said Farallon minimized its risk before the spread widened to current levels. Farallon general counsel Mark Wehrly declined to comment.

Although most arbs experienced some pain from the GE-Honeywell situation, Bear Stearns' arbitrage department has emerged unscathed. The investment bank advised Honeywell in the deal and its takeover traders have been prohibited from playing the deal.

GE'S DEAL FOR  HONEYWELL appeared to be in peril as the company and European regulators remained far apart on concessions. If the deal dies, it would mark the first time European regulators have killed a merger that U.S. officials have  approved,  underscoring critical differences in how Brussels and Washington view mergers. Honeywell's  stock price dropped 12%, and speculation increased about United Technologies or another suitor emerging.

The daily drumbeat of profit warnings socked stocks again yesterday, and concerns over the likely demise of the
$41 billion GE-Honeywellmerger sent chills through the broader market.

Word from GE boss Jack Welch that he'd rather ditch the deal than meet  European regulators' demands to sell off the most attractive parts of  Honeywell  sent the Dow Jones industrial average sinking.

"Ugly, with a capital U," was how Bill Meehan, Cantor Fitzgerald's chief market strategist described yesterday's action.
He said investors have tired of the constant barrage of disappointing corporate forecasts.

"The primary concern now is that the economic recovery won't happen in the original time frame," which was the second half of this year, he said. Now it's more likely the start of the recovery will inch into 2002.

As a result, Meehan cut his closely watched forecast for the Nasdaq's near-term low to 1,520 from an earlier projection of 1,980. After hitting a low, he expects a turnaround.
The Nasdaq plunged 3.7 percent yesterday, or 77.59, to 2,044.07.

The Dow also tumbled, shaving 1.7 percent , or 181.49, to 10,690.13, pulled down by Honeywell, which tanked more than 12 percent , or $5.16, to $37.10.
GE added $1.01 to $48.86, but United Technologies, which could scoop up the pieces from the collapse, sank
$3.16 to $77.10.

Corning fell $1.35, or 8 percent , to $16, a 52-week low, as Merrill Lynch analysts predicted fiber optic sales would be weak in coming quarters. It shed another 40 cents after-hours.

JDS Uniphase, which warned after the market closed its fourth-quarter revenues would fall below projections, tanked more than 10 percent in night trading to $12.25, a 52-week low, after falling 37 cents to $13.81 during regular trading.

Telecom equipment maker Lucent continued its descent, dropping 49 cents, or 7 percent , to $6.75. Its bonds were recently lowered to junk status and yesterday there was speculation a planned sale of two manufacturing plants had fallen through.
The stock market's decline since spring 2000 and dropoff in trading volume took a bite out of discount brokerage
Charles Schwab, which said the average number of daily trades fell to a 19-month low. Schwab fell 7.6 percent ,
$1.32 to $16.03.

According to Trimtabs, which charts mutual funds, investors pulled $4.9 billion out of stock mutual funds during the past week. A week before, investors added $10.9 billion.

New economic reports also failed to cheer investors -- but further solidified the opinion the Fed will cut rates by a quarter percentage point at the end of June as part of its continuing efforts to spur economic growth.

Yesterday, the Labor Department's producer price index, which measures inflation at the wholesale level, crept up a slim 0.1 percent in May, following a modest 0.3 percent increase in April.

In another report, the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims fell by 12,000 last week from the prior week, but monthly figures remained high, indicating that lay-offs are continuing.

Honeywell Merger with General Electric  Stands on Shaky Ground

The fate of 125,000  Honeywell  International employees remained on hold Thursday after the Morris
Township-based industrial company and  General Electric  Co. refused to meet  Europe's demands that they pare
down their proposed $41 billion  merger.

Nothing is final, but the refusal to meet demands of Europeanregulators is expected to end  GE's bid to forge one of the world's largest industrial companies.

Thursday was the last day for the companies to modify their merger plan, and the European Commission must make a final decision by July 12. The merger already has the approval of American regulators.

If the European Commission rejects the final proposal, Honeywell would remain an independent company, at least for now. That would preserve some jobs in Morris Township. When the merger was announced last year, Honeywell said 550 position in corporate headquarters would be eliminated and thousands of other cuts in operating units were expected.

But the merger would have no effect on 6,500 jobs, including 200 in Morris Township, that Honeywell announced in April that it would eliminate. That move came in response to lower operating profits at each of Honeywell's four major business units and was not related to the GE deal.
The cuts represent about 5 percent of the company's worldwide workforce.

In all, Honeywell has about 1,800 employees in Morris Township, including those in its technical labs and performance polymers and chemical unit.
Investors reacted Thursday by selling Honeywell stock, which dropped $5.16, or 12 percent, to $37.10. Shares in
Fairfield, Conn.-based GE rose $1.01 to $48.86.

Honeywell's future was up in the air Thursday. Before negotiations ended, Michael Bonsignore, the chairman and chief executive, issued a statement saying Honeywell supported GE's filing with the European Commission, but the company also had in place "a comprehensive contingency plan . . . if we must move forward as an independent company."

Bonsignore offered no details. Tom Crane, a company spokesman, said Honeywell was "prepared for any outcome" but was "not commenting beyond what we have in the release."

If the merger falls apart, Honeywell would be forced to go back to operating independently, said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with H. C. Wainwright & Co. in New York.

Since Oct. 22, when the GE deal was announced, "Honeywell was operating as if it were being acquired," he said.
But that independence could be short-term, Lustgarten said.

"Remember, GE was not the only company interested in Honeywell," he said. "If the deal does break, do other companies come out?"

GE entered the Honeywell sweepstakes at the eleventh hour, making a counteroffer just as Honeywell's board of directors was considering an offer from United Technologies Corp.
Tyco International Ltd. and Siemens AG of Germany also were mentioned as potential suitors.

GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch said in a statement Thursday that his company "wanted to complete the transaction but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal."

The proposal the companies submitted to the European Commission in Brussels on Thursday did not come close to meeting conditions set by the commission, Welch said.

The proposal, which includes $2.2 billion in divestitures in Honeywell's aerospace business, was a "final offer," said GE spokesman Gary Sheffer.

Rejection by European regulators would kill Welch's vision of combining GE's dominant aircraft engine and servicing business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics for commercial jets and air traffic control systems.

It also would be a personal blow to Welch, who postponed his retirement until the end of 2001 to oversee the merger.

The European Union's top antitrust official, Mario Monti, expressed "regret" at the companies' position, but said his office would continue to review the deal "unless the merger notification is formally withdrawn."
Sheffer said GE has no plans to withdraw the proposal.

The plan would reduce Honeywell's $25 billion in revenues by 9 percent, and combined GE-Honeywell revenues would decline by about 1.5 percent. Despite the divestitures, GE said anticipated cost savings of $3 billion from the merger would remain largely intact.

GE said regulators were demanding billions more in divestitures of virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.

Welch, who in October predicted quick regulatory approval of the sale, said the demands show "you are never too old to get surprised."

"In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined," he said.

Monti said late Thursday that European regulators were still "giving guidance on how best to resolve the remaining competition concerns."

"As I have indicated to Mr. Welch, we were ready to consider improved commitments until the legal deadline" of midnight Thursday in Brussels for concession offers.
But Welch left Brussels on Thursday after a third meeting with Monti in two days.

To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law, just as European companies must abide by U.S. law to do business here. A decision to block the deal also could spark a trans-Atlantic trade war, as nearly happened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing Co.'s impending merger with McDonnell Douglas Corp.

To gain approval from the U.S. Justice Department, Honeywell had to agree to divest its helicopter engine business and authorize new third-party maintenance and repair service for some of its aircraft engines.

Europe has become a tougher environment for mergers. In his two years on the job, Monti has blocked or required substantial modifications to several high-profile deals, including a proposed deal to merge MCI WorldCom and Sprint.

In his statement, Monti said he was not necessarily seeking "further divestments in the aerospace industry but rather a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior of GECAS," GE Capital Aviation Services.

After the midnight deadline, the European Commission will pass along the offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment. Monti's office then will assess the responses and make its final recommendation to the full commission, which will rule no later than July 12.

White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, traveling with President Bush in Sweden on Thursday, said Welch contacted the White House chief of staff, Andrew Card, about the conflict between GE and European regulators.


Page 113 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"I know they spoke. I can't say specifically if there was a request, what it was. The United States obviously supports the merger," Fleischer said.

Asked whether Welch wanted Bush to press the matter with EU officials, Fleischer said, "I'm not prepared to say that. I don't have that information."

BRUSSELS, June 15 (Reuters) -  European Union merger rules give firms in the position of General Electric
and Honeywell  a limited opportunity to make modified proposals to meet  EU competition concerns, the EU said
on Friday.

GE's bid to buy  Honeywell  was in peril on Thursday as the companies' last-ditch divestiture offers aimed at salvaging the $41.7 billion deal fell far short of the  EU's regulatory demands.

The deadline for making concessions to meet the EU's concerns in the case expired at midnight (2200 GMT) Thursday.

European Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said that, even after the deadline, EU merger rules give merging companies a "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals".

"But those proposals are only acceptable if the Commission concludes that they remmove any competition concerns completely and if they also allow time for proper consultation of the (EU's) advisory committee on mergers," she told reporters.

"The European Commission's review of this deal continues. There is a deadline to rule on it, that is July 12," Torres said. "We will have to wait for the Commission to take a decision on it."

PARIS, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans urged the  European Union to consider the positive implications of the  General Electric  Co's takeover of  Honeywell  International Corp, and said he was hopeful the  EU would back the deal.

"I want to encourage them (the  EU) to continue to think...seriously about how constructive a  merger like this could be," Evans told reporters during a visit to Paris.
"I'm the eternal optimist. I want to continue to think that they will work out their differences," he said. General Electric made a final offer of concessions on Thursday to the European Commission, knowing its
remedies fell far short of requirements set by the Commission to clear the $41.7 billion deal.

"I don't want to speculate on what the impact might be if they do block it," Evans said. "This merger in my view is a very positive kind of a step for free trade as well as being positive for people in this region of the world as well as other regions of the world."

BUSH STEPS INTO GE MERGER ROW.

President Bush today weighed into the increasingly bitter row over  General Electric's  $42 billion (#30 billion)
takeover of  Honeywell,  saying he was "concerned" that  Europe appeared set to block it.

Speaking in Warsaw, the US President said: "Our Government looked at the  merger and approved  it, Canada looked at it and  approved  it." He added that he was concerned the deal had stumbled in Brussels.

Industrial conglomerate GE said yesterday it believed that demands from Brussels competition regulators would kill the proposed deal, the biggest ever industrial takeover offer. It said the demands went "far beyond" anything it was prepared to concede. The EU anti-trust authorities have until 12 July to make a final ruling.
Failure of the deal would be a blow to the reputation of GE's much-admired chairman and chief executive Jack
Welch.

JACK WELCH, chairman and chief executive of America's General Electric,  launched an attack on the European Commission yesterday amid expectations that the regulator will scupper the industrial group's $41 billion ( #29 billion) merger with Honeywell.

GE said yesterday that it was "not optimistic" that concessions, including the sale of the Honeywell  aerospace operations which generate $2.2 billion in revenue, would be enough to secure the Commission's approval  for the deal.
The company gave warning that its proposals fell short of the "billions more" of divestments demanded by the
Commission to allay competition concerns.

"This shows you are never too old to get surprised," Mr Welch said in Brussels. "In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined, and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the US and Canada."

Mr Welch said that the Commission's "extraordinary demands", which could include the divestment of Honeywell's entire avionics business, went far beyond the point at which GE would do a deal to take over Honeywell.

GE generates 19 per cent of its global revenues in Europe, with Honeywell's European operations contributing 27 per cent of its group turnover.

Michael Bonsignore, Honeywell executive chairman, said there was a contingency plan to continue as an independent company if the deal failed.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -  General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International refused to meet  Europe's demands that they pare down their proposed $41 billion merger, all but ending a bid to forge one of the world's largest industrial companies.

Honeywell electronics and GECAS financing.
Honeywell shares fell $5.16, or 12.2 percent, to $37.10 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where GE
shares closed up $1.01, or 2.1 percent, to $48.86.

City - Bush challenges EC over merger.

PRESIDENT Bush yesterday waded into the row between  General Electric  and the European Commission when he questioned Brussels  regulators' attempts to block the American giant's $45 billion purchase of engineering group Honeywell.

"Our government looked at the merger and approved  it, Canada looked at the  merger and approved  it ... I am concerned that the  Europeans  have rejected [the deal]," he told reporters in Warsaw.

The move comes as Mr Bush clashes with European governments over his anti-missile programme and his views on the environment.

The European Commission has criticised the deal as giving GE too much control over the aerospace business. On Thursday, GE told regulators it was prepared to sell off businesses generating $2.2 billion of revenue to avoid accusations of industry dominance. However, this is not expected to be enough to assuage Europe.
The deadline for the European Commission to approve the deal is July 12. If competition commissioner Mario
Monti blocks the acquisition, it will be the first time the EC has taken such action against two US companies.

GE chairman Jack Welch met with Mr Monti twice on Wednesday and spoke with him on Thursday to persuade him to approve the deal. Mr Welch also called Mr Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card to ask for White House support.

However, the interventions appear to have been insufficient to secure the deal. Earlier this week Mr Welch said: "The demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the US or Canada."

Investors have been increasingly doubtful that the deal will be approved. The arbitrage spread - the difference between General Electric and Honeywell's share price - grew on Wednesday to its widest point since the deal was announced.

Blame it on  Europe.

When General Electric  Co. Chairman John F. Welch announced Thursday that his $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell  International Inc. appeared doomed, he cited the "extraordinary demands" of  European antitrust       regulators.

On Friday, President George W. Bush said he was concerned that the European Union might block the deal after American and Canadian regulators had already approved it. U.S. officials have raised those concerns with EU leaders, he said.

But aerospace industry analysts say it's simplistic to paint the conflict as a trans-Atlantic feud, and many in the United States are privately cheering the EU. A fair number of the companies testifying against GE during the EU's hearings were American, or have American roots -- including United Technologies Corp., Rockwell International Inc., and regional-jet manufacturer Fairchild Dornier.
But analysts say the finer points of the case are likely to be forgotten by politicians on both sides of the ocean. "From a practical standpoint, it was never a U.S.-Europe thing. It's an industry issue," said Mark A. Bobbi, an
aerospace and energy consultant based in Prospect.

Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think tank, cautioned against reading the EU's tough stance as a sign of worsening tensions with the United States. The politicians know that American competitors were among those pushing the commission to reject the deal, he said.

"I don't think this is a disaster for the U.S.-European relationship," Prestowitz said. "On the other hand, this will cause difficulties. It adds one more issue to a pile of issues."

Those issues are substantial. They include Europe's subsidy of commercial aircraft and engine programs, the longtime rivalry between Europe's Airbus Industrie and Seattle's Boeing Co., and differing views of antitrust theory.

On Friday, GE said it had made its final offer to the EU and would not make substantive changes. Willy Helin, a spokesman for the European Commission in Washington, said the EU would continue its review of the case. A decision is due by July 12.

"Our job is to conduct the scrutiny in all honesty, which we do, regardless of the nationality of the companies involved," he said. He said pressure from the United States would not help. "That's not going to impress us, folks. Because that's not the way we do our job."
For legal reasons linked to its agreement with Honeywell, GE is unlikely to pull the plug on the deal until the EU
rules, analysts said.

The U.S. companies that objected to the merger either compete with GE and Honeywell or buy their products. They worry that GE-Honeywell could stifle competition by bundling electronics, engines and mechanical components into a single package at a cut-rate price.

Bobbi said GE competitors on both sides of the Atlantic benefit from the dissolution of the deal, but GE suppliers may be disappointed.

Others had different reasons for cheering the anticipated rejection. They approve of Europe's more sweeping view of business deals and applaud its willingness to stand up for itself.

"We're in a global world, you know, a global economy," said Joel N. Gordes, a Connecticut energy consultant who tracks UTC's power generation business. "Maybe this is, in one form, a little retaliation. The EU is telling the U.S.,
`You are the one remaining superpower, for sure. That doesn't mean we don't have our say in things.' "
But others suggested that the EU is fighting globalization, not helping it.

"The EU tends to be protectionist. In that sense, I think, their posture is harmful," said John N. Lavieri, president of Sterling Engineering Corp., a Winsted machine shop. "Globalization is inevitable. Those who continue to block it are standing in the way of an oncoming tide. It's coming whether they continue to stand there or not."

Lavieri said small companies such as Sterling Engineering can't afford to see themselves anymore as Pratt suppliers or GE suppliers.
"They should be thinking much more broadly," he said, "than what happens to one customer." Document hfct000020010711dx6g00li5

United, Honeywell  Not a Perfect Match Merger: If the engine maker renews its bid, it could face the same
EUantitrust objections that doomed GE's offer.

WASHINGTON -- If United Technologies Corp. renews its attempt to buy Honeywell  International Inc., analysts said Friday, its bid will be complicated by the same objections from Europe that have all but ended  General         Electric  Co.'s romance with  Honeywell.

After  GE, United Technologies is seen as the leading candidate to link up with Honeywell.  The Hartford, Conn.-based engine maker made a $40-billion offer for  Honeywell  in October, before GE weighed in at $42 billion, and remains one of the few industrial giants large enough to mount a serious bid for the firm.
Other industrial electronics firms, including Siemens of Germany and Tyco International, headquartered in
Bermuda, are seen as long shots.
"I think the likelihood is very high" that United Technologies will make an offer, said Matt Collins, an analyst at the
Edward Jones investment banking firm in Maryland Heights, Mo.

United Technologies was among a few companies that lobbied against GE's proposed merger with Honeywell after European antitrust officials began reviewing the deal in February.

United Technologies complained that a combination of GE and Honeywell would strengthen GE's ability to undercut competitors by packaging sales of jet engines and electronic cockpit controls with loans to customers to finance the purchases.

European Union antitrust authorities leveled those same objections when they demanded wholesale divestitures by a merged GE and Honeywell--divestitures the two companies have refused to make.

Unless an agreement can be reached by July 12, the merger will be the first ever to win favor with U.S. antitrust agencies only to be shot down by the EU, which reserves the right to review mergers of foreign companies doing substantial business in Europe.

Some analysts say United Technologies, which, like GE, runs an aircraft engine business in addition to a division that builds helicopters, is vulnerable to those same antitrust concerns.
"There are problems," said Scott Keller, president of the New York-based research firm DealAnalytics. United
Technologies and Honeywell "have basically the same overlaps that GE had with Honeywell."
A United Technologies spokesman declined comment on the company's plans. The company, which employs
160,000 people worldwide, including 2,800 in California, probably will wait until the EU's July 12 deadline to make
a decision.

With the deadline so far off, some analysts and EU officials held open the possibility that GE and Honeywell could resolve their impasse with the EU.

European Union Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said Friday that GE and Honeywell had a "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals" to European antitrust officials.

"I still think it's possible this deal could go through," said Paul H. Nisbet, an aerospace analyst at JSA Research Inc. in Newport, R.I. "A lot of negative repercussions could result if this deal falls" because of European opposition.

Amid the speculation over a renewed bid, shares of United Technologies fell $2.35 to $74.75 in trading Friday. General Electric's shares fell 5 cents to $48.81. Honeywell rose $1.60 to $38.70, all on the New York Stock Exchange.

PARIS AIR SHOW: Snemca Eyes Honeywell  Assets

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Although  General Electric  Co.'s (GE) proposed acquisition of  Honeywell  International Inc. (HON) may look dead in the water, French engine maker Snecma (F.SNM) said Saturday it would be keen to bid for certain assets  Honeywell  may be forced to sell.
Should European Union competition authorities eventually clear the merger, GE would be forced by antitrust
bodies on both sides of the Atlantic to sell some assets to meet competition concerns.

"We would be interested to acquire some of these," Snecma Chairman Jean-Paul Bechat said at a press conference at the Paris Air Show, although he didn't elaborate on which units he's interested in.
However, Snecma's chances to bag some of Honeywell's prize assets look slim as the E.U. is expected to kill the
GE-Honeywell merger on the grounds it would dominate certain markets.

Snecma has a privileged relationship with GE through a 50-50 jet engine making joint venture called CFM International.

AVIATION - EU OFFERS CHANCE OF FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS WITH GE IN HONEYWELL MERGER CASE.
542 words
16 June 2001
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2001 European Report.
The European Commission revealed on June 15 that there is still some room for manoeuvre in its negotiations with General Electric  (GE) over its proposed Euro 48 billion takeover of fellow American industrial giant Honeywell.  This is despite the official deadline for a final offer from  GE having passed at midnight on June 14.

GE revealed that it was not optimistic that its proposals would meet with the demands made, so far, by the Commission. In its June 14 offer,  GE said that it would make divestitures worth  Euro 2.4 billion ($2.2 billion) in Honeywell's  new business and regional jet engine, air turbine starters and certain avionics and non-avionics products divisions.  GE also offered to make  GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) into a separate "ring-fenced" entity. Although, GECAS would remain 100% owned and managed by  GE.

In a written statement, GE said: "The proposed divestitures are far short of the European Commission's demands, which seek billions more than the proposed GE divestitures. GE is not optimistic that its proposal will meet with European regulatory approval." It went on to say that: "The submitted undertakings, in the unlikely event they
were accepted, would modestly reduce the positive impacts of the GE-Honeywell combination. The divestitures would reduce Honeywell's $25 billion in revenues by 9% and revenues of the combined GE-Honeywell by about
1.5%. The $3 billion of synergies that had been projected for the acquisition would remain largely intact and the estimated increase in earnings per share in the first full year of combined operations would be reduced from 11 cents to 9 cents. There would be no change in the longer-term expectations that the Honeywell acquisition would increase GE's earning growth rate by one to two points."In reply, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said that the EU's competition authority was still actively trying to seek a solution with GE. "The co-operation between the Commission's competition department and the representatives of GE/Honeywell and between Mr Welch and myself was always constructive and cordial. My services were actively involved in giving guidance on how best to resolve the remaining competition concerns and, as I indicated to Mr Welch, we were ready to consider improved commitments until the legal deadline of tonight" (June 14). More specifically, he said the Commission had
explored with the companies "commitments which would not have entailed further divestments in the aerospace industry, but rather a structural commitment to modify the commercial behaviour of GECAS. We regret that this avenue has not been pursued. Unless the merger notification is formally withdrawn, the Commission will continue with the review procedure."The Commission refused to be drawn any further on when and what it would
announce with regards to the GE case.

-The EU's competition regulator launched a second-stage inquiry under the 1989 Merger Regulation at the end of February as it was concerned that the $45 billion merger deal that would create the world's biggest industrial company. The GE-Honeywell combine would also have a huge presence in the aviation industry. Competition authorities in the US are also investigating the deal.-.

BRUSSELS, Belgium - European Union regulators suggested more bargaining Friday with  General Electric  Co. on its proposed $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International, but  GE insisted the  EU must take or leave the last offer.

The deal to create one of the world's largest industrial companies needs  approval  by Europe, but GE and Honeywell  reaffirmed their willingness to walk away from a  merger rather than meet EU demands that they sell off parts of their companies in the process.

The companies submitted a final proposal Thursday, the formal deadline for making concessions, and acknowledged at the time it was far from what EU regulators wanted.

On Friday, EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said both firms still have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals."
GE's response was immediate.
"We will not make another proposal," said spokesman Gary Sheffer. "Negotiations are over."
EU regulators were worried that the merger would give GE an unfair advantage over some European companies. They will now pass along details of the GE offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment,
assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission, which will issue a
decision by July 12.

A decision to block the deal could damage trade relations between the United States and Europe, which were threatened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

Europe has become tougher in its review of mergers, blocking or insisting on important modifications to several high-profile deals.
GE had sought White House support for the deal. At a news conference Friday in Warsaw, Poland, President
Bush said: "We brought up the proposed merger at the appropriate levels during this trip and before the trip.

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it. The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it," he said.
The proposal submitted by GE and Honeywell to the European Commission included $2.2 billion in divestitures. Document saen000020010713dx6g00jk4

EU and U.S. regulators had different takes on GE-Honeywell merger

NEW YORK (AP) - General Electric  Co. chief executive Jack Welch never thought his career could end on this note: GE's $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International on the verge of collapsing because of  competition concerns from Europe.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the  merger through, was pleased when the U.S. Justice Department gave its blessing to the deal in May.

But after European regulators this past week demanded billions of dollars in divestitures Welch didn't anticipate and would not accept, he said the move made him realize "you are never too old to get surprised."

If the deal is rejected by the European Commission, it would be the first large merger by American companies to be stopped by European regulators following U.S. approval.
Even President Bush, traveling in Europe, expressed his surprise at the outcome.

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it," Bush told reporters at a news conference in Warsaw. "The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it."

But experts said the European response was predictable, given concerns expressed by EU officials that a combined GE-Honeywell could leverage its dominance in aircraft engines into other areas of its business, including aircraft leasing, engine services and aerospace electronics, also known as avionics.

In particular, they feared GE-Honeywell could bundle aircraft-engines and avionics into packages and sell them to Boeing or Airbus at discounts that competitors like Britain's Rolls Royce PLC and France's Thales SA couldn't match.

"I think the European competition is not only trying to protect the competition, it's trying to protect the consumer," said Caglar Ozden, an economics professor at Emory University in Atlanta who specializes in EU antitrust issues. "They're thinking of the best interests of British Airlines and Air France because they are the consumers."

At the heart of the matter are different philosophies in how U.S. and European regulators evaluate the pros and cons of big merger deals, experts say.

"There's no question they have a greater sensitivity to dominant market positions," said Ernest Gellhorn, a law professor at George Mason University. "Our view is that bigness is not bad, as long as what firms are doing is competitive."

EU officials prefer to deal with perceived anticompetitive aspects of deals before approval is granted so enforcement isn't necessary, said Mark Powell, an antitrust lawyer with White & Case in Brussels, Belgium, where the EU Commission is based

But U.S. officials tend not to worry as much before mergers, knowing they can take legal action against the combined companies after antitrust issues emerge.



Page 137 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
U.S. regulators also tend to look favorably on cost savings through mergers because increased profits are passed on to shareholders, said Peter Tague, a managing director with Citigroup Inc.'s Schroders Salomon Smith Barney in London who specializes in trans-Atlantic mergers and acquisitions.

"The EU can tend to view cost savings as an indication that you have created an increasingly dominant market player, which is an inherently undesirable outcome - because they will ultimately exert market power which increases prices and puts customers into a weaker position," Tague said.

Tague and others predicted the objections to the GE-Honeywell deal will deter mergers by American companies who do business in Europe.

But some said Welch should have realized early on that big obstacles could have emerged in Europe that didn't come up when the company was seeking approval from U.S. regulators.
"This whole case has been an elaborate journey that I think GE didn't anticipate embarking on," Powell said. Added Tague: "The European Commission is not out of step. They're just walking to a different drumbeat." End adv for weekend editions

General Electric  head pessimistic about winning EU approval  to merge with Honeywell

By JAMEY KEATEN Associated Press Writer

PARIS (AP) - U.S.-based General Electric  Co. is not ready to abandon its planned dlrs 41 billion  merger with
Honeywell  International - even though European approval  for the deal looks unlikely.

GE President Jeffrey Immelt, speaking to reporters in the French capital ahead of a stop at the Paris Air Show, said GE will let the  European Commission regulatory process play out.

"We are part of a formal process," said Immelt, speaking at the luxurious George V hotel in central Paris. "We have not necessarily given up on the deal, but what we have done is submit our final offer."

The deal needs Europe's approval, but EU regulators on Friday said more negotiations were needed because the proposal was not acceptable. The merger would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

"There will be no more negotiation on the side of GE," said Immelt. "We are very far apart as we sit here today, and fundamentally, we are planning our future without Honeywell."

Immelt said GE made its final offer on Thursday. EU regulators will now pass along details of the offer to its competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission. It must decide by July 12.

General Electric announced the deal in October in the midst of merger talks between Honeywell and rival United Technologies. United Technologies executives on Thursday held informal meetings about the possibility of making a bid for Honeywell, the New York Times reported, citing unidentified sources.
Immelt declined to comment on what competitors might do.

"Honeywell has been supportive of everything we have done," he said. "We will do whatever we can possibly do to be totally fair to Honeywell."

The proposal submitted by GE and Honeywell to the EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti included dlrs 2.2 billion in divestitures, and GE said it will not go further than that.

GE said regulators were demanding billions more in divestitures of nearly all of Honeywell's aviation electronics unit and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.

U.S. antitrust regulators, who asked for about dlrs 200 million in divestitures from the companies, have conditionally approved the merger. If the deal falls apart because of EU misgivings, it would mark the first time the
15-nation body had halted a deal between two U.S. companies that had already won the go-ahead in the United
States.

Jack Welch, GE's famed chairman and chief executive, delayed his retirement to see through the merger. A rejection would kill his vision of combining GE's dominant aircraft engine and servicing business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics for commercial jets and air traffic control systems.
"But Jack and I always agreed it wasn't a deal that we would do at any price," Immelt said. (jk-ps)

General Electric  head pessimistic about winning EU approval  to merge with Honeywell

PARIS (AP) - U.S.-based General Electric  Co. is not ready to abandon its planned dlrs 41 billion  merger with
Honeywell  International - even though European approval  for the deal looks unlikely.

GE President Jeffrey Immelt, speaking to reporters in the French capital ahead of a stop at the Paris Air Show, said GE will let the  European Commission regulatory process play out.

"We are part of a formal process," said Immelt, speaking at the luxurious George V hotel in central Paris. "We have not necessarily given up on the deal, but what we have done is submit our final offer."

The deal needs Europe's approval, but EU regulators on Friday said more negotiations were needed because the proposal was not acceptable. The merger would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

"There will be no more negotiation on the side of GE," said Immelt. "We are very far apart as we sit here today, and fundamentally, we are planning our future without Honeywell."

Immelt said GE made its final offer on Thursday. EU regulators will now pass along details of the offer to its competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission. It must decide by July 12.

General Electric announced the deal in October in the midst of merger talks between Honeywell and rival United Technologies. United Technologies executives on Thursday held informal meetings about the possibility of making a bid for Honeywell, the New York Times reported, citing unidentified sources.
Immelt declined to comment on what competitors might do.

"Honeywell has been supportive of everything we have done," he said. "We will do whatever we can possibly do to be totally fair to Honeywell."

The proposal submitted by GE and Honeywell to the EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti included dlrs 2.2 billion in divestitures, and GE said it will not go further than that.

GE said regulators were demanding billions more in divestitures of nearly all of Honeywell's aviation electronics unit and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.

U.S. antitrust regulators, who asked for about dlrs 200 million in divestitures from the companies, have conditionally approved the merger. If the deal falls apart because of EU misgivings, it would mark the first time the
15-nation body had halted a deal between two U.S. companies that had already won the go-ahead in the United
States.

Jack Welch, GE's famed chairman and chief executive, delayed his retirement to see through the merger. A rejection would kill his vision of combining GE's dominant aircraft engine and servicing business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics for commercial jets and air traffic control systems.
"But Jack and I always agreed it wasn't a deal that we would do at any price," Immelt said. (jk-ps)

GE, Honeywell  say no to EU demands

European Union regulators suggested more bargaining Friday with  General Electric  Co. on its proposed $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International, but  GE insisted the  EU must take or leave the last offer.

The deal to create one of the world's largest industrial companies needs  approval  by Europe, but GE and Honeywell  reaffirmed their willingness to walk away from a  merger rather than meet EU demands that they sell off parts of their companies in the process.

The companies submitted a final proposal Thursday, the formal deadline for making concessions, and acknowledged at the time it was far from what EU regulators wanted.

On Friday, EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said both firms still have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals."

GE's response was immediate: "We will not make another proposal," said company spokesman Gary Sheffer. "Negotiations are over."
EU regulators were worried that the merger would give GE an unfair advantage over some European companies. They will now pass along details of the GE offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment,
assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission, which will issue a
decision by July 12.

A decision to block the deal could damage trade relations between the United States and Europe, which were threatened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

Europe has become tougher in its review of mergers, blocking or insisting on important modifications to several high-profile deals.
GE had sought White House support for the deal, and at a news conference Friday in Warsaw, Poland, President
Bush said, "We brought up the proposed merger at the appropriate levels during this trip and before the trip."

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it. The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it," he said.

BUSH TURNS UP HEAT : LINKS MERGER WITH GOOD TRADE RELATIONS
By PAUL THARP

President Bush is turning up the political pressure in hopes of convincing  European regulators to accept
General Electric's  $41 billion bid for  Honeywell.

Bush said he was "concerned" that the  European Union might kill the  merger as anti-competitive, but he remained tight-lipped about his plans to assist in a rescue.

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it. The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it," Bush said in Brussels yesterday on his fourth stop of a five-country European tour.
"And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it. That's all I've got to say on it," he said.

But his Commerce Secretary, Don Evans, touring in nearby Paris, was more outspoken and said he wanted the EU to reconsider its position, suggesting that a rejection might harm U.S.-European trade relations - the strongest statement thus far in the flap.

"We would encourage [the EU] to think about how constructive this merger would be to opening trade around the world and the benefit it would be to citizens around the world," Evans said earlier in the day, prior to Bush's Brussels remarks.

"I want to think they'll work out their differences," Evans said. "This merger would be a positive kind of step for free trade."
Shortly after Evans' comments, a surprise trade step did emerge.

The EU and U.S. officials revealed in nearby Toulouse, France, that they had broken a long stalemate and are working on an agreement to let the U.S. ship more beef to Europe if the beef is hormone-free.

The U.S. and the EU had been in bitter standoff over hormone-laced beef, with the U.S. seeking $110 million in penalties against EU for blocking those beef imports. The break came late Thursday at a summit in Goteborg, Sweden, where Bush was meeting with European leaders.

The beef issue had been seen as a bargaining chip in the behind-the-scenes dealmaking over the GE-Honeywell flap.

The EU fears GE would combine its dominance in aircraft engines for large commercial jets with Honeywell's dominance in avionics and non-avionics parts. That would give GE enough clout to shut out British and French aircraft companies from making rival bids on projects.
GE has offered to sell $2.2 billion of Honeywell avionics business and restrict GE's dominance in buying aircraft. GE and its Chairman, Jack Welch, have insisted they won't revise their bid or sell any more assets to make the
EU happy.

The EU has said it could leave the door open to a compromise until July 12, when its governing body formally votes to accept or reject the merger.
"I'm the eternal optimist," Evans said. "I want to continue to think that they will work out their differences."

A spokeswoman for Honeywell said yesterday that GE has made its last offer and has no intention of making further offers. At the same time, GE plans not to withdraw its application with the EU.

Europe Opens Door for G.E., Just Slightly
By PAUL MELLER with CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH
1,006 words
16 June 2001
The New York Times
NYTF
Page 1, Column 5

BRUSSELS, June 15 -- Amid signs of political pressure from the United States, the European Commission said today that a ''limited opportunity'' remained for  General Electric  to offer more concessions to win approval  of its planned $45 billion acquisition of  Honeywell  International, even though the deadline for new concessions had passed.

President Bush said at a news conference in Warsaw today that ''we brought up the proposed  merger at the appropriate levels during this trip and before the trip.''
''I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it,'' Mr. Bush said.

European Commission officials declined to comment on the president's remarks. But a commission spokeswoman, Amelia Torres, did note that General Electric and Honeywell could ''submit modified proposals after the deadline,'' which expired at midnight Thursday.

Earlier that day, after General Electric said it was ''not optimistic'' that its final concessions would be approved, the commission said that it wanted the company to make a ''structural commitment to modify the commercial
behavior'' of its aircraft leasing unit.

''The commission has rejected the companies' final concessions, but it has still left a window open for negotiation,'' a Brussels competition lawyer said. The commission must issue a ruling by July 12.

In the remaining weeks, the focus turns to the national competition regulators who sit on an advisory committee that oversees important merger rulings -- and whom General Electric may now try to lobby.

While the national regulators cannot force the commission to back down, they can add to the political pressure on the commission if they are persuaded that General Electric's offer on Thursday represents a sufficient remedy.

''One of the main reasons G.E. held a hearing at the end of May was to alert the national competition regulators to what it considers overzealousness by the commission,'' a lawyer close to the talks said.
While there is a precedent for a last-minute deal -- Boeing made late concessions to win European approval of its
$14 billion acquisition of McDonnell Douglas in 1997 -- the window of opportunity in General Electric's case
appears very small.

Shares of Honeywell rose 4.3 percent today, to $38.70, helped in part by speculation that United Technologies, which had been rebuffed last fall in its efforts to acquire Honeywell, might bid again if General Electric's bid is not approved.

But Honeywell shares are down 16 percent from their level when the deal with General Electric was announced on Oct. 23. G.E. shares are also down from October, so that its stock offer, which was valued at $45 billion when it was announced, is now worth $42 billion.

''My gut tells me this deal will still happen, but it's obviously a very intense negotiation,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager of the Dreyfus Corporation, whose funds hold millions of G.E. shares. ''And if Jack Welch says that the deal will no longer make sense if he has to divest too much, then I believe him.''

Page 149 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Indeed, memos sent to General Electric employees on Thursday indicated that the company was already preparing for the deal to be rejected. A memo sent by David Calhoun, the head of GE Aircraft Engines, instructed employees ''to suspend all integration planning activities and refocus your efforts on meeting aircraft engines' current customer and business requirements.''

And a memo to employees from Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s president and the designated successor to John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive, struck a very pessimistic tone. ''We are not confident that our proposal will be approved since it falls well short of the commission's demands,'' he wrote.

While General Electric may simply be engaged in brinkmanship with the European Commission, which has become more aggressive in reviewing mergers under the leadership of Mario Monti, some analysts and people close to the company speculated that G.E. might now want the deal to be scuttled.

While Honeywell's aircraft and avionics businesses are still vibrant, analysts say, its automation, specialty chemicals, process controls and other businesses have suffered amid the economic slowdown since the deal was announced.
If G.E. is forced to sell off too much of the aviation-related businesses they say, it has little of value left.

''There's just not a lot of upside left in the deal unless the European Union accepts G.E.'s terms,'' said James N. Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research. ''This was supposed to cap Jack Welch's career, but maybe Jeff Immelt is not so anxious to take on an asset that is stripped of the very things that made G.E. want it in the first place.''

Nonetheless, Mr. Welch has a personal stake in seeing the Honeywell deal done. He deferred his planned retirement, set for April, until the end of the year to help with the integration of Honeywell.
In its final concession proposal, G.E. offered to set up its aircraft leasing unit, GE Capital Aviation Services, or
Gecas, as a separate entity from GE Capital. But the commission said that was not enough.

American lawyers who are familiar with European merger reviews said that they expected the commission would be satisfied if General Electric spun off nearly 20 percent of Gecas. That way Gecas would be its own profit center, with a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. G.E. could still consolidate its results, and would effectively control its operations. But its dealings would be transparent, and that could assuage regulators' fears that the combined company would favor Honeywell avionics products and G.E. engines.

If General Electric does end up modifying its proposal on Gecas, it would have to offer a solution ''that would not require any monitoring,'' Ms. Torres, the commission spokeswoman, said.

In a broader context, the comments on the deal by Mr. Bush point to a possible renewed intensification of trade tensions between the United States and Europe.

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- European Union regulators suggested more bargaining Friday with  General Electric Co. on its proposed $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International, but  GE insisted the  EU must take or leave the last offer.

The deal to create one of the world's largest industrial companies needs  approval  by Europe, but GE and Honeywell  reaffirmed their willingness to walk away from a  merger rather than meet EU demands that they sell off parts of their companies.

MERGER COLLAPSE TROUBLES ANALYSTS HONEYWELL FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE

Twenty-four hours after the apparent collapse of the  General Electric  Co.'s takeover of  Honeywell  International, analysts were left guessing the next steps for both companies.

For GE, rejection of the $41 billion deal by European regulators would be an embarrassment, especially after it predicted last fall that the  merger would sail through the regulatory process. But even without  Honeywell,  GE is predicting strong growth.

Morris Township-based Honeywell, on the other hand, would be left to decide whether to look for another merger partner or go it alone, analysts say.

Although the companies and the European Union Commission were far apart when the negotiating deadline passed Thursday, the EU left the door open Friday by suggesting more bargaining. The commission has until July
12 to make a final decision.

But GE insisted the EU must take or leave its last offer. "We will not make another proposal," company spokesman Gary Sheffer said.

"Negotiations are over." The one wild card is what role the Bush administration may play in pressuring European regulators.
"Our government looked at the merger and approved it," President Bush said at a news conference Friday in
Warsaw, Poland.
"The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it," Bush said. "And I am concerned that the
Europeans have rejected it."

In Paris, U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans urged the EU Commission to approve the sale, saying a successful deal would be "a positive kind of step for free trade." But if the merger is rejected, Honeywell faces tough choices, said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at JSA Research Inc. in Newport, R.I.

"They can go in one of two directions, either joining with someone else, or doing it alone as they had done for eons," said Nisbet, who predicts GE will eventually prevail.

"It's sort of hard to find too many companies that can buy a $40 billion firm," Nisbet said. Before GE entered the picture, Honeywell's board was set to vote on a takeover proposal by United Technologies Corp. Tyco International Ltd. and Siemens AG of Germany also were mentioned as potential suitors.

United Technologies of Hartford, Conn., had no comment on whether it would be interested in Honeywell. "It's speculation at this point," said spokesman Paul Jackson.
If Honeywell remains independent, "it would take them awhile to get back on their feet," Nisbet said.

"They've been in limbo for a number of months, getting ready for the takeover by GE," he said. "Any moves they have made were in furtherance of GE's wishes. They haven't done anything for their own future." Independence could lead to big changes, said James Ayscue, an analyst with PNC Advisors in Philadelphia.

"We look for a major restructuring announcement by the company, and significant cost reductions going forward," Ayscue said.

Page 152 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"They had to put on hold certain divestitures of some of their underperforming businesses," Ayscue said. "We expect if it doesn't go through, the company will immediately divest its friction materials, automotive consumer products, and U.S. security monitoring businesses."
He predicts there is a less than 50 percent chance GE will get Honeywell.

In its final offer Thursday, GE said it was willing to sell off Honeywell units with about $2.2 billion in annual revenue, including regional-jet engines, air-turbine starters, and other aerospace products.

But the EU commission insisted on billions of dollars more in divestitures, including virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business, and its production of power generating systems.

GE says will not negotiate  further  with EU on Honeywell
589 words
16 June 2001
Agence France-Presse
AFPR
English
(Copyright 2001)
PARIS, June 16 (AFP) - US conglomerate General Electric  said on Saturday it would keep its planned  merger
with Honeywell  on the table despite resistance from the European Union competition authorities.
But in sign it had lost hope in the deal it added it was also planning for life without  Honeywell.

"We are part of a formal process. We have not really given up the deal, but we have submitted our final offer," General Electric President and chairman-elect Jeffrey R. Immelt told a news conference in Paris on the occasion of the Paris Air Show.
"GE is planning its future without Honeywell," he added.

He was speaking a day after the prospect of a new transatlantic trade war surfaced after US President George W. Bush voiced concern on a European tour at prospects that the EU might halt the 45- billion-dollar (52-billion-euro) merger, which has already won regulatory approval in the United States.

The European Commission, the 15-nation bloc's competition watchdog, is understood to oppose the planned acquisition of Honeywell unless the new group divests itself of large sections of its business.

The EU's Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, who is due to give a decision on July 12, has said the Commission would continue its probe into the merger unless the companies formally withdrew their notification of the deal.

GE had said Thursday, shortly before a midnight deadline, that it had made some concessions to meet the Commission's objections, but believed that these fell far short of changes which the Brussels- based body wanted.

GE chief Immelt said on Saturday that although the company had made more concessions to the EU authorities than it had had to do to gain approval in the United States, the two sides "are just far apart."

Asked at the news conference why the EU authorities had taken a tougher line than the US authorities had done to the plan, he said the EU had seemed to give greater weight to competitors' concerns than those of customers.

He would not name which competitors might have influenced the EU stand, but said they included both European and American parties.

Boeing Vice President Harry Stonecipher, however, accused European competitor Airbus in a newspaper interview of stoking EU opposition to the mega-merger and warned of the consequences of a veto.
"It is not airlines who are against the merger, but rather Airbus", he said in the weekend edition of Le Monde. Separately, on the first day of a Paris Air Show awash with merger speculation, French engine manufacturer
Snecma, which is 97.3 percent state owned, and a current partner of General Electric, said it would like to snap
up parts of its rival Honeywell if the deal with GE fell through.
"We are watching this case very closely," Snecma's Jean-Paul Bechat told reporters.

"As a partner of General Electric we hope they are successful," he added, "But there is another side to this ... the competition authorities in Brussels have asked for Honeywell to carry out a certain number of disinvestments."

GE says it will not negotiate  further  with EU on Honeywell

ATTENTION - UPDATES with Airbus denial of opposition to  merger
PARIS, June 16 (AFP) - US conglomerate  General Electric  said on Saturday it would keep its planned
45-billion-dollar merger with Honeywell  on the table despite resistance from the  European Union competition
authorities.
But in a sign it had lost hope in the deal, it added it was also planning for life without  Honeywell.

"We are part of a formal process. We have not really given up the deal, but we have submitted our final offer," General Electric President and chairman-elect Jeffrey Immelt told a news conference in Paris on the occasion of the Paris Air Show.
"GE is planning its future without Honeywell," he added.

He was speaking a day after the prospect of a new transatlantic trade war surfaced after US President George W. Bush voiced concern on a European tour at prospects that the EU might halt the 45- billion-dollar (52-billion-euro) merger, which has already won regulatory approval in the United States.

The European Commission, the 15-nation bloc's competition watchdog, is understood to oppose the planned acquisition of Honeywell unless the new group divests itself of large sections of its business.

The EU's Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, who is due to give a decision on July 12, has said the Commission would continue its probe into the merger unless the companies formally withdrew their notification of the deal.

GE had said Thursday, shortly before a midnight deadline, that it had made some concessions to meet the Commission's objections, but believed that these fell far short of changes which the Brussels- based body wanted.

GE chief Immelt said on Saturday that although the company had made more concessions to the EU authorities than it had to do to gain approval in the United States, the two sides "are just far apart."

Asked at the news conference why the EU authorities had taken a tougher line than the US authorities, he said the Europeans seemed to give greater weight to competitors' concerns than those of customers.

He would not name which competitors might have influenced the EU stand, but said they included both European and American parties.

Boeing Vice President Harry Stonecipher, however, accused European competitor Airbus in a newspaper interview of stoking EU opposition to the mega-merger and warned of the consequences of a veto.
"It is not airlines who are against the merger, but rather Airbus", he said in the weekend edition of Le Monde. European Commission officials and Airbus promptly denied the accusation.
"We're in favour of the merger," Rainer Hertrich, the joint chief executive of EADS, the European aviation company that owns 80 percent of Airbus told reporters at the air show.
"There are always some differing views between the United States and the European Union, but EADS and
Airbus are not involved."

In Brussels, a commission official said Stonecipher's claim was "unjustified."

"Airbus never expressed concerns over the GE/Honeywell merger", said the official, who asked not to be identified.

Separately, on the first day of a Paris Air Show awash with merger speculation, French engine manufacturer Snecma, which is 97.3 percent state owned, and a current partner of General Electric, said it would like to snap up parts of its rival Honeywell if the deal with GE fell through.
"We are watching this case very closely," Snecma's Jean-Paul Bechat told reporters.

"As a partner of General Electric we hope they are successful," he added, "But there is another side to this ... the competition authorities in Brussels have asked for Honeywell to carry out a certain number of disinvestments."

Conversely, General Electric said it would also like to bid for the remaining capital of Snecma, but admitted that it was unlikely that the French government would allow it.
"I'd love to bid for Snecma, but I don't think the French government will allow us," said David Calhoun, the
President and CEO of GE's aircraft engines division at the news conference.

GE tells EU to take merger deal or leave it

European Union regulators suggested more bargaining Friday with  General Electric  Co. on its proposed $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International, but  GE insisted the  EU must take or leave the last offer.

The deal to create one of the world's largest industrial companies needs approval  by European regulators, but GE and Honeywell  reaffirmed their willingness to walk away from a merger rather than meet EU demands that they sell off parts of their companies in the process.

The companies submitted a final proposal Thursday, the formal deadline for making concessions, and acknowledged at the time it was far from what EU regulators wanted.

On Friday, EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said both firms still have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals."

GE's response was immediate: "We will not make another proposal," said company spokesman Gary Sheffer. "Negotiations are over."

Milwaukee-based Rockwell International, meantime, acknowledged Friday that it had been working behind the scenes to block the deal.
"Rockwell has been actively involved in objecting to this transaction," Rockwell spokesman Don McGrath said
Friday from his company's corporate headquarters in Milwaukee.
Strained relations a threat

EU regulators were worried that the merger would give GE an unfair advantage over some European companies. They will now pass along details of the GE offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission, which will issue a
decision by July 12.

A decision to block the deal could damage trade relations between the United States and Europe, which were threatened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

Europe has become tougher in its review of mergers, blocking or insisting on important modifications to several high-profile deals.
GE had sought White House support for the deal, and at a news conference Friday in Warsaw, Poland, President
Bush said, "We brought up the proposed merger at the appropriate levels during this trip and before the trip.

"Our government looked at the merger and approved it. The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it," he said.

In Paris, U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans urged the EU Commission to approve the deal, saying a successful deal would be "a positive kind of step for free trade".

"I would encourage (the EU) to think how constructive a merger like this would be," Evans said at a news conference at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Page 159 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"I must be an eternal optimist," he added. "I'm still hoping they will work out their differences."

GE's chairman and chief executive, Jack Welch, who had led negotiations in the final days in Brussels, has said he considered approval unlikely. Honeywell said it was ready with plans to move ahead on its own, but there was immediately speculation that it may renew merger discussions with United Technologies Corp., which had been a suitor until GE moved in.

The proposal submitted by GE and Honeywell to the European Commission included $2.2 billion in divestitures. GE said regulators wanted them to sell off billions more, including nearly all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.

Rockwell International Corp. wants the merger blocked because its avionics division would face unfair competition from a combined GE and Honeywell, McGrath said.

Rockwell Collins, the company's avionics division, goes head to head with Honeywell on the sale of some electronics placed in airplane cockpits. Collins is set to spin off from Rockwell on June 29.
A Collins representative testified against the GE-Honeywell merger at recent closed-door hearings before the
European Union Commission, McGrath said.
"We have objected based on the financial power of GE in the marketplace," McGrath said.

GE has a division that is one of the largest buyers of commercial aircraft, which it then leases or sells. Other companies could be harmed if the division were to limit its purchases to planes equipped only with GE engines or Honeywell avionics equipment.

"If they chose that as a weapon, it could be used in the wrong way," Michael Barnes, Rockwell's senior vice president of finance and its chief financial officer, said during a conference call with analysts in the spring.

Another concern involves the possibility that the combined company could give discounts or other incentives on bundled packages of aviation equipment from the merged company.

Barnes said Rockwell Collins was a solid business but eventually would have to deal with a "powerful force" if the merger went through.

GE REJECTS MORE TALKS ON MERGER; NO NEW OFFERS PLANNED ON HONEYWELL DEAL

European Union regulators suggested more bargaining yesterday with General Electric  Co. on its proposed
$41 billion merger with Honeywell  International Inc., but  GE insisted the EU must take or leave the last offer.
The merger needs approval  by Europe, but GE and Honeywell  reaffirmed their willingness to walk away from a
merger rather than meet EU demands that they sell off parts of their companies in the process.

If the deal to create one of the world's largest industrial companies is rejected by the European Commission, it would be the first large merger by American companies to be stopped by European regulators following U.S. approval.

The companies submitted a final proposal Thursday, the formal deadline for making concessions, and acknowledged at the time it was far from what EU regulators wanted. Yesterday, EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said both firms still have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals."

GE's response was immediate: "We will not make another proposal," said company spokesman Gary Sheffer. "Negotiations are over."

They will pass along details of the GE offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission, which will issue a decision by
July 12.

The European market has become tougher in its review of mergers, blocking or insisting on important modifications to several high-profile deals.

"There's no question they have a greater sensitivity to dominant market positions," Ernest Gellhorn, a law professor at George Mason University, said about European regulators. "Our view is that bigness is not bad, as long as what firms are doing is competitive."

EU officials prefer to deal with perceived anticompetitive aspects of deals before approval is granted so enforcement isn't necessary, said Mark Powell, an antitrust lawyer with White & Case in Brussels, Belgium, where the EU Commission is based

But U.S. officials tend not to worry as much before mergers, knowing they can take legal action against the combined companies after antitrust issues emerge.
U.S. regulators also tend to look favorably on cost savings through mergers because increased profit is passed
on to shareholders, said Peter Tague, a managing director with Citigroup Inc.'s Schroders Salomon Smith Barney
in London who specializes in trans-Atlantic mergers and acquisitions.
"The European Commission is not out of step," Tague said. "They're just walking to a different drumbeat." GE had sought White House support for the deal, and at a news conference yesterday in Warsaw, Poland,
President Bush said, "Our government looked at the merger and approved it. The Canadian government looked
at the merger and approved it. And I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it."

The $41 billion merger of General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International has been all but called off after the companies refused Europe's demands to cut the size of the combined company.  European Union Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said Friday that both companies still have ''limited opportunity to submit modified proposals.'' A  GE spokesman said Friday that the companies won't make changes to a divestiture plan they submitted that was  rejected by EU officials. ''We will not make another proposal,'' said the spokesman, Gary Sheffer. ''Negotiations are over.'' After spending two days in Brussels trying to salvage the deal, GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said the companies could not agree to terms laid down by EU regulators. ''In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our  European advisers imagined,'' Welch said.
Comair, pilots reach tentative deal to end strike

Comair and its striking pilots have reached a tentative deal to resume operations at the airline, which has been grounded for 2 1/2 months. The agreement came after three days of negotiations in Washington with federal mediators. Neither side would discuss details. Former passengers of the nation's second-largest regional carrier, based in the Cincinnati area, were hopeful Comair soon would be back in the sky.
Calvin Klein hit by protesters' pie intended for Karl Lagerfeld

Designer Calvin Klein took it on the chin, but fur protesters who hurled tofu cream pies were aiming at Karl Lagerfeld. Lagerfeld and Klein were walking up a red carpet at Lincoln Center in New York when two animal rights activists stormed up yelling, ''fur pimp'' and ''fur kills'' as they unleashed two tofu pies. Two other protesters threw two more pies from behind a barricaded area. Pieces of pie hit Klein, but Lagerfeld emerged relatively clean. ''Our activists won't win any prizes for their aim, but they would for their compassion and devotion to
animals,'' said Andrew Butler, a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Six PETA members were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and trespassing after the incident at the 20th-annual American Fashion Awards.
Hog farm pact
reached in Minnesota case

Minnesota pollution control officials have reached an agreement in principle with a major hog-raising operation in Renville County over air pollution violations. The deal is between the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and ValAdCo, a livestock cooperative with seven hog-raising sites in the county. It calls for a $125,000 penalty, new technology to cover 14 newer manure lagoons, more air quality monitoring and faster ways to resolve odor problems. The agreement was reached late Thursday night, hours after a representative from the state attorney general's office involved in the mediation talks left and said talks had broken off. The withdrawal raised the possibility that Mike Hatch, the attorney general, might take separate legal action against ValAdCo.

Airliner lands safely after
reporting hydraulic problem

A Northwest Airlines jet with a nose wheel hydraulic problem landed safely Friday at Los Angeles International Airport. The pilot of Northwest Flight 111 from Minneapolis to John Wayne International Airport in Orange County, Cali., said there was an indication there might be a hydraulic problem so the flight was diverted to Los Angeles, airline spokeswoman Kathy Peach said. The A320 Airbus carrying 117 passengers and a crew of five landed safely at 10:45 a.m. and passengers were released at the airport terminal, Peach said. The hydraulic failure involved nose wheel steering, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jerry Snyder said. Inspectors were examining the hydraulics.

EU veto of GE merger angers US.
By CONOR O'CLERY International Business Editor WALL STREET.

On a US financial news channel yesterday, a commentator casually referred to Brussels as "the enemy". This was indicative of the ill-tempered fall-out from the  European Union's first-ever veto of a  merger between two US companies - General Electric  and Honeywell  - and one that was already  approved  by US officials.

The timing could not have been worse for President George W. Bush, visiting Europe to forge alliances with  EU leaders. "I am concerned that the  Europeans  have rejected it," he said in Warsaw. General Electric's  takeover bid for Honeywell  International would have created one of the world's largest industrial companies. GE dominates the market for aircraft engines and servicing, while  Honeywell  is a leading supplier of aircraft electronics and air traffic control systems.

Mr Bush said he had raised the proposed $41.7 billion (E48.4 billion) deal with his European counterparts but EU regulators have already scuppered the merger on the grounds that it violated competition rules and would unfairly undercut corporate competitors (such as Rolls Royce). Brussels has a legal obligation to vet mergers of US companies with large revenue sales in Europe and does so with the acquiescence of Washington.

The ability to kill deals is two way. Objections from the US Federal Trade Commission stymied French firm Air Liquide's attempts to acquire British industrial gases group BOC last year, though it had EU approval. Nevertheless, the blocking of GE's merger with Honeywell has seen an exacerbation of transatlantic economic and political tensions. General Electric made a final offer of concessions on Thursday to meet a deadline set by the EU Commission, but by then it knew these fell far short of requirements set by Brussels. GE said it was
prepared to sell Honeywell units with annual revenue of $2.2 billion, which would reduce combined GE-Honeywell revenues by about 1.5 per cent, but the Commission asked for divestitures of units with revenues totalling $5.2 billion.

Commission spokeswoman Ms Amelia Torres left the door open a crack yesterday when she told reporters in Brussels that GE and Honeywell had "a limited opportunity to submit modified proposals". But she said the Commission would have to conclude that the new proposals removed all competition concerns. The absolute deadline for the Commission to act is July 12th. Observers noted that a deal permitting Boeing to acquire McDonnell Douglas came on the eve of the final deadline in 1997, long after the remedies deadline - and after considerable lobbying by the United States.

The failure to close the deal is a setback for GE head Mr Jack Welch, who postponed retirement to see it through. The office of the European Competition Commissioner, Mr Mario Monti, cited concerns about the proposed merger's potential to reduce competition in sectors such as regional-jet engines, where GE and Honeywell dominated the market; as well as the impact on competition of "bundling" GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS).

GE Merger Collapse Troubles  Analysts

Twenty-four hours after the apparent collapse of the  General Electric  Co.'s takeover of  Honeywell  International, analysts were left guessing the next steps for both companies.

For GE, rejection of the $41 billion deal by European regulators would be an embarrassment, especially after it predicted last fall that the  merger would sail through the regulatory process. But even without  Honeywell,  GE is predicting strong growth.

Morris Township-based Honeywell, on the other hand, would be left to decide whether to look for another merger partner or go it alone, analysts say.

Although the companies and the European Union Commission were far apart when the negotiating deadline passed Thursday, the EU left the door open Friday by suggesting more bargaining. The commission has until July
12 to make a final decision.

But GE insisted the EU must take or leave its last offer. "We will not make another proposal," company spokesman Gary Sheffer said. "Negotiations are over."
The one wild card is what role the Bush administration may play in pressuring European regulators.
"Our government looked at the merger and approved it," President Bush said at a news conference Friday in
Warsaw, Poland.
"The Canadian government looked at the merger and approved it," Bush said. "And I am concerned that the
Europeans have rejected it."

In Paris, U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans urged the EU Commission to approve the sale, saying a successful deal would be "a positive kind of step for free trade."
But if the merger is rejected, Honeywell faces tough choices, said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at JSA Research Inc. in
Newport, R.I.

"They can go in one of two directions, either joining with someone else, or doing it alone as they had done for eons," said Nisbet, who predicts GE will eventually prevail.

"It's sort of hard to find too many companies that can buy a $40 billion firm," Nisbet said. Before GE entered the picture, Honeywell's board was set to vote on a takeover proposal by United Technologies Corp. Tyco International Ltd. and Siemens AG of Germany also were mentioned as potential suitors.

United Technologies of Hartford, Conn., had no comment on whether it would be interested in Honeywell. "It's speculation at this point," said spokesman Paul Jackson.
If Honeywell remains independent, "it would take them awhile to get back on their feet," Nisbet said.

"They've been in limbo for a number of months, getting ready for the takeover by GE," he said. "Any moves they have made were in furtherance of GE's wishes. They haven't done anything for their own future."
Independence could lead to big changes, said James Ayscue, an analyst with PNC Advisors in Philadelphia.

"We look for a major restructuring announcement by the company, and significant cost reductions going forward," Ayscue said.



Page 166 of 169 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"They had to put on hold certain divestitures of some of their underperforming businesses," Ayscue said. "We expect if it doesn't go through, the company will immediately divest its friction materials, automotive consumer products, and U.S. security monitoring businesses."
He predicts there is a less than 50 percent chance GE will get Honeywell.

In its final offer Thursday, GE said it was willing to sell off Honeywell units with about $2.2 billion in annual revenue, including regional-jet engines, air-turbine starters, and other aerospace products.

But the EU commission insisted on billions of dollars more in divestitures, including virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business, and its production of power generating systems.

PARIS, June 16 (Reuters) - A top executive at U.S. aerospace giant Boeing accused rival Airbus of opposing a planned merger between GE and Honeywell  that risks being blocked by  European competition authorities.
"It is not the airline companies that are opposed to the  merger, it is Airbus," Boeing Vice-Chairman Harry
Stonecipher said in an interview with French newspaper Le Monde.
"If the European Commission blocks the project there could be trade problems." Stonecipher told the daily. A Boeing spokesman confirmed that Stonecipher had made the remarks to the French newspaper.

LE BOURGET, France, June 16 (Reuters) -  General Electric  Chairman-elect and President Jeffrey Immelt said on Saturday his company would not negotiate any more with the European Commission on its proposed merger with Honeywell  and predicted European authorities would not approve the deal.

Speaking at the biannual air show here, Immelt also said that differences with the  Commission went beyond the issue of GE's GECAS unit.
He said the company had no plans to withdraw its offer to sell some $2.2 billion in assets to satisfy European
Commission demands unless Honeywell agreed to it.
