SCA is trying its utmost to save the  Metsa Tissue deal, and is today submitting a revised proposal to the  EU Commission. The Commission has identified several problems arising out of the deal, affecting the Swedish and Finnish markets, and has placed some stringent conditions for the deal to be accepted.

This is SCA's last opportunity to influence the  EU Commission, which will need to take a final decision on the matter no later than 9 February.

SCA Files Last-Minute Metsa Tissue Concessions With EU

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- Swedish forestry products company Svenska Cellulosa  AB (S.SCA) said Thursday that it has filed an offer of concessions relating to its purchase of Metsa Tissue Oyj (Y.MTT) with the  European Union Commission, raising hopes that the deal may yet squeeze through.

SCA's filing comes on the last day that concessions relating to its purchase of  Metsae Serla Oyj's (Y.MSR)  Metsa
Tissue unit would be accepted.
"We have filed a proposal to the Commission (Thursday)," said vice president for investor communications Peter
Nyquist. "Now we have to wait. We expect a decision at the latest by Feb. 10," he said.

Offers of divestments or other concessions aimed at winning antitrust clearance have to be submitted one month before the Commission probe ends.

The Commission opened an in-depth, four-month probe into the deal on Sept. 27 because of concerns about competition in the hygienic tissue market. It rejected concessions offered by SCA during the first-phase probe of the deal. Sources close to the deal say the Commission has indicated that the companies will have to do much more to win antitrust approval.
"The proposed acquisition will give rise to very high market shares for some consumer tissue products in
Scandinavian countries," the Commission said on opening the second-phase probe.

It noted that for so-called "away from home" hygienic tissue products - used in hotels, schools and hospitals - the merged group would have a very high market share in Nordic countries and a high share in most other E.U. countries.

The Commission said the remedies offered in the first phase were "unsatisfactory, particularly because they don't address the problem outside Sweden, Norway and Denmark." It wasn't even clear whether the remedies offered would be enough within those countries, the Commission said.

Moreover, the Commission said, "it wasn't clear that the remedies offered would resolve the competition problems within those countries."

Though SCA has only a small market share in Finland, it is the "most credible competitive restraint to an existing duopoly between Metsae Tissue and American company Fort James, each with about half of the tissue market," the E.U. executive said.
The linkup between SCA and Metsae would remove SCA's restraining influence, the Commission said.

In addition, the Commission was skeptical about whether part of the proposal, to split brands on a geographical basis, would work.
Thursday's proposals are the only ones submitted since the first phase offers, Nyquist said.

The Metsa Tissue acquisition is part of a wider deal between SCA and Metsa Serla. However, the Metsa Tissue transaction isn't a condition for the rest of the deal to go through, said Nyquist.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Swedish forestry products company Svenska Cellulosa AB (S.SCA) may have pulled the requisite rabbit out of the hat Thursday when it filed a last minute offer of concessions with the European Union Commission relating to its purchase of Metsa Tissue (Y.MTT).

As the last day for remedy proposals drew to a close, SCA filed with the commission, said vice president for investor communications Peter Nyquist. He declined to say whether SCA believes these would be adequate to win the antitrust all-clear. "Now we have to wait, we expect a decision at the latest by Feb. 10," he said.

However, to have any chance of acceptance, the SCA offer will have to meet stringent demands laid down by the commission aimed at ensuring the deal won't lead to price increases or otherwise discriminate against
consumers.

SCA's high market share in its domestic markets is the main issue putting the deal at risk. "It's a common ailment in Scandinavian mergers," said Kiran Desai, competition partner at Rowe & Maw in Brussels. This phenomenon was illustrated last year when Swedish commercial vehicles maker AB Volvo (VOLVY) was forced to abort its bid for rival Swedish truck maker Scania AB (SCVA) after the commission said it would have been too dominant in Scandinavian markets.

Even an appeal from Swedish prime minister Goran Persson couldn't persuade E.U. competition chief Mario Monti that the deal should be looked at from a pan-European perspective. This would have given the companies a much more modest market share, compared with their 90% chunk of the Swedish truck market. Yet despite moves towards a more unified market in Europe, many products still have to be considered on a national basis, including trucks and buses, said Monti.
And paper products too, by the looks of this case, lawyers say.

"There is no reason why (SCA/Metsa) shouldn't follow a similar kind of reasoning....paper products are relatively bulky and companies aren't going to be shipping (them) all over the place," said Peter Willis, competition expert at Taylor Joynson Garret in London.

In the Volvo case, the commission also dismissed the argument that companies from smaller E.U. countries are more likely to have larger market shares in their domestic markets and shouldn't be discriminated against.

Merger deals in Nordic countries often involve "parties who already operate there because historically other companies might have ignored that region," said Rowe & May's Desai. In some ways the companies only have themselves to blame for pursuing larger market shares in their home markets, "instead of attempting to buy in Spain for example and try to be pan-European," Desai said.

The commission had slammed SCA's only previous remedy offers when it opened an indepth probe into the deal on Sept. 27. It said that the merged group would have a very high market share for so-called "away from home" hygienic tissue products - used in hotels, schools and hospitals - in Nordic countries and a high share in most other E.U. countries.

The remedies offered "don't address the problem outside Sweden, Norway and Denmark," the Commission said. It wasn't even clear whether the remedies offered would be adequate within Nordic countries, the commission said.

In addition, although SCA has only a small market share in Finland it is the "most credible competitive restraint to an existing duopoly between Metsae Tissue and American company Fort James, each with about half of the tissue market," the commission said.

EU Appears Poised to Block  SCA's Acquisition of Finland's Metsae-Tissue

BRUSSELS -- Svenska Cellulosa  AB's only chance of avoiding a  European Commission veto of its purchase of Finland's Metsae Tissue Corp. is to withdraw the deal with the hope of refiling it if the paper market becomes more pan-European, Brussels-based observers say.

European Union antitrust experts met Tuesday to give their final opinion on the merger, and are understood to have upheld the commission's recommendation that the deal be blocked. The commission's final decision, unless the deal is withdrawn, is likely to be given on Jan. 31.

SCA filed additional concessions Jan. 11, just before the deadline for remedy proposals expired. However, Brussels-based sources say these weren't enough to change the commission's opinion that the deal would be detrimental for competition, particularly in Nordic markets.

It's "technically impossible" for the companies to submit any further concession offers now, said Kiran Desai, competition lawyer at Rowe & Maw in Brussels.

Last year, fellow Scandinavian companies Volvo AB (VOLVY) and Scania AB submitted concessions after the official deadline had passed. These were rejected by the commission, which said that remedy proposals would only be examined at that late stage if there were "exceptional circumstances."
"Withdrawing the deal looks like the only way the two companies could avoid the veto," said another
Brussels-based lawyer who declined to be named.

This has the advantage of keeping details about concessions offered out of the public domain, lawyers said. Should the deal be blocked, the European Commission will provide a detailed decision setting out what the companies offered and its reasons for the veto.

"If the deal is blocked, then the market knows that any other deal with that other company has got to get rid of certain things," Mr. Desai said. "This is valuable information for competitors."

The companies could then refile an altered version of their alliance at a later date, perhaps once the paper market has become more pan-European.

However, in some instances companies might prefer to receive the commission's decision. For example, WorldCom Inc. (WCOM) is appealing the commission's negative decision on its planned merger with Sprint Corp. (FON) in July. If the companies had successfully withdrawn their merger and the commission hadn't given a final decision, there wouldn't have been anything to appeal.

The commission had slammed SCA's only previous remedy offers when it opened an in-depth probe into the deal on Sept. 27. It said the merged group would have a very high market share for so-called away from home
hygienic tissue products -- used in hotels, schools and hospitals -- in Nordic countries, and a high share in most other EU countries.

EU To Block SCA's Metsae Tissue Buy Unless It Withdraws

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- Svenska Cellulosa  AB's (S.SCA) only chance of avoiding a  European Union Commission veto of its purchase of Finland's Metsae Tissue Corp. (Y.MMT) is to withdraw the deal with the hope of refiling it if the paper market becomes more pan-European, Brussels-based observers say.

National E.U. antitrust experts met on Tuesday to give their final opinion on the merger, and are understood to have upheld the Commission's recommendation that the deal be blocked. The Commission's final decision, unless the deal is withdrawn, is likely to be given on Jan. 31.

SCA filed additional concessions last Thursday, just before the deadline for remedy proposals expired. However, Brussels-based sources say these weren't enough to change the Commission's opinion that the deal would be detrimental for competition, particularly in Nordic markets.

It's "technically impossible" for the companies to submit any further concession offers now, Kiran Desai, competition partner at Rowe & Maw in Brussels said.

UPDATE 3-EU set to block SCA buy of Metsa Tissue-source.
By Adrian Croft
588 words
17 January 2001
19:30
Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to block plans by Swedish paper and packaging group Svenska Cellulosa  AB to buy Finland's  Metsa Tissue Oyj, a Commission source said on Wednesday.
It would be only the 14th deal blocked by the  European Union's antitrust watchdog in the 10 years since the  EU
adopted its merger control regulations.
The SCA-Metsa Tissue deal is part of a complicated exchange of assets between Svenska Cellulosa and
Metsa-Serla. The Commission has already authorised, with conditions, Metsa-Serla's purchase of Modo and SCA
Packaging's acquisition of Metsa Corrugated.

Last September, the Commission launched an in-depth, four-month probe of SCA's acquisition of Metsa Tissue, voicing concern about "the strong positions that would arise on certain markets for hygienic tissue products."

The deadline for the Commission to rule is February 9 but the Commission source said the European Union executive had already drawn up a draft decision blocking the deal.

"We have given them our suggestion of concessions but we have had no reaction to that. We expect a decision in the beginning of February and at the present moment have no comment," SCA Chief Executive Sverker
Martin-Lof told Reuters.

Veli-Matti Mynttinen, chief financial officer of Metsa-Serla, which is selling Metsa Tissue to Swedish SCA, declined comment.
"We want to wait to see what the final decision is before we comment further," Mynttinen told Reuters in Helsinki. The Commission is concerned that the merged company would have 80 percent or more market share in some
paper products in the Nordic region, the Commission source said.
LITTLE HOPE OF REVERSAL

The source said there were obvious competition problems with the deal, singling out products such as toilet tissue and paper towels.

The source held out little hope that the decision could be reversed at this late stage. Under EU merger rules, companies have until one month before the deadline to offer concessions to meet the EU's competition concerns.

But SCA had made no further concessions beyond one it offered during the Commission's initial one-month review, the source said.
At this late stage, concessions could only be accepted under exceptional circumstances.
The Commission source also took issue with criticism of the Commission voiced in a Financial Times interview on
Wednesday with Martin-Lof, SCA's chief executive.

"The Commission is still in my view looking into the back mirror and not catching the dynamic of the market because it still tends to look at markets very locally," he was quoted as saying.


Page 12 of 62 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission source said the EU executive had gone out of its way to encourage the companies to address competition concerns but they had shown little willingness to do so.

Martin-Lof's criticism of the Commission hit a nerve because the Commission came under fire when it blocked another Scandinavian merger in March 2000.

When the Commission blocked Swedish truck and busmaker Volvo's $6.95 billion merger with rival Scania, Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson attacked the ruling, saying it seemed to go "against the basic concept of the common market."

EU set to block SCA buy of Metsa Tissue-source.

BRUSSELS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to block plans by Swedish paper and packaging group Svenska Cellulosa  AB to buy Finland's  Metsa Tissue Oyj through a Dutch unit of  SCA, a Commission source said on Wednesday.
The Commission is nearing the end of a four-month, in-depth review of the deal.

The deadline for a Commission ruling is February 9, but the Commission source said the European Union executive had already drawn up a draft decision blocking the deal.

The Commission is concerned that the merged company would have 80 percent or more market share in some paper products in the Nordic region.

The source held out little hope that the decision could be reversed at this late stage. Under EU merger rules, companies have until one month before the deadline to offer concessions to meet the EU's competition concerns.

But SCA had made no further concessions beyond one it offered during the Commission's initial one-month review, the source said.

UPDATE 1-EU set to block SCA buy of Metsa Tissue-source.

BRUSSELS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to block plans by Swedish paper and packaging group Svenska Cellulosa  AB to buy Finland's  Metsa Tissue Oyj, a Commission source said on Wednesday.
It would be only the 14th deal blocked by the  European Union's antitrust watchdog in the 10 years since the  EU
adopted its merger control regulations.
The SCA-Metsa Tissue deal is part of a complicated exchange of assets between Svenska Cellulosa and
Metsa-Serla. The Commission has already authorised, with conditions, Metsa-Serla's purchase of Modo and SCA
Packaging's acquisition of Metsa Corrugated.

Last September, the Commission launched an in-depth, four-month probe of SCA's acquisition of Metsa Tissue, voicing concern about "the strong positions that would arise on certain markets for hygienic tissue products."

The deadline for the Commission to rule is February 9 but the Commission source said the European Union executive had already drawn up a draft decision blocking the deal.

The source rejected criticism of the Commission's procedures by SCA's chief executive, saying the EU executive had done all it could to encourage the firms to address competition problems but they had shown little willingness to do so.

The Commission is concerned that the merged company would have 80 percent or more market share in some paper products in the Nordic region.

The source said there were obvious competition problems with the deal, singling out products such as toilet tissue and paper towels.
LITTLE HOPE OF REVERSAL

The source held out little hope that the decision could be reversed at this late stage. Under EU merger rules, companies have until one month before the deadline to offer concessions to meet the EU's competition concerns.

But SCA had made no further concessions beyond one it offered during the Commission's initial one-month review, the source said.
At this late stage, concessions could only be accepted under exceptional circumstances.
The Commission source also took issue with criticism of the Commission voiced in a Financial Times interview on
Wednesday by Sverker Martin-Lof, SCA's chief executive.

"The Commission is still in my view looking into the back mirror and not catching the dynamic of the market because it still tends to look at markets very locally," he was quoted as saying.

The Commission had gone out of its way to encourage the companies to address the competition problems posed by the proposed deal, the Commission source said.

Martin-Lof's criticism of the Commission hit a nerve because the Commission came under fire when it blocked another Scandinavian merger in March 2000.

When the Commission blocked Swedish truck and busmaker Volvo's $6.95 billion merger with rival Scania, Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson attacked the ruling, saying it seemed to go "against the basic concept of the common market."

Svenska Cellulosa  AB is preparing to drop its planned 650-million-euro ($612.9-million U.S.) acquisition of Finland's Metsa Tissue Oyj, following the  European Commission's recommendation to block the deal. Antitrust regulators have determined that a merger would allow the companies to capture a disproportionate share of the Nordic market for hygienic tissue products.

Paper Firms In Scandinavia Set to Kill Deal

BRUSSELS -- Swedish paper company Svenska Cellulosa  AB is set to fold its planned 650-million-euro ($613 million) acquisition of Finland's  Metsa-Tissue following the European Commission's recommendation to block the merger.

The commission's antitrust regulators have determined that the deal would allow the companies to capture an outsize share of the Nordic market for hygienic tissue products, such as toilet paper and kitchen towels. And according to people familiar with the investigation, the companies failed to offer enough divestitures to satisfy the commission.

Svenska Cellulosa subsidiary SCA, which made the cash bid for Metsa-Tissue's shares, appeared resigned to the commission's opposition. Chief Executive Sverker Martin-Lof said the company had already proposed its final concessions. If regulators veto the merger as appears likely -- a final ruling is expected by Feb. 9 -- SCA won't attempt to revive it in a different form, he said.

The SCA-Metsa-Tissue deal is part of a complex swap of assets between Svenska Cellulosa and Metsa-Serla Corp, which owns 66% of Metsa-Tissue. If the commission blocks the deal, SCA will continue to own about 20% of Metsa-Tissue.

At a meeting with the European Union's national antitrust regulators on Tuesday, the commission's officials said SCA didn't offer to divest enough paper mills in Sweden and also failed to come up with remedies for the Finnish and Danish paper markets, according to one person who attended the meeting. As a result, the commission decided that the merger would raise barriers to the entry of new competitors in Scandinavia.

The commission's antitrust regulators have determined that a merger would allow the companies to capture a disproportionate share of the Nordic market for hygienic tissue products, such as toilet paper and kitchen towels. According to people familiar with the investigation, the companies failed to propose enough asset disposals to satisfy the commission.

The regulators' final decision is expected by Feb. 9, but there is nothing the two companies can do this late in the process to avert a veto, short of abandoning their merger plan.

Svenska Cellulosa's subsidiary SCA, which made the cash bid for Metsa Tissue, appeared resigned to the commission's opposition. Chief Executive Sverker Martin-Lof said the company had already proposed its final concessions and was prepared "to live with the outcome" of the commission's inquiry. If regulators veto the merger, SCA will not attempt to revive it in a different form, he added.

The SCA-Metsa Tissue deal is part of a complex swap of assets between Svenska Cellulosa and Metsa-Serla Corp., which owns 66% of Metsa Tissue. If the deal is aborted, SCA will continue to own about 20% of Metsa Tissue.

The Swedish group  SCA - SVENSKA CELLULOSA AKTIEBOLAGET (absorbent hygiene products, corrugated cardboard packaging and art paper) took-over, for USD 850 million, from AFH - AWAY FROM HOME (turnover of USD 640 million in 2000 with 2,200 employees and a production of 435,000 tonnes of hygiene paper), a company regrouping the paper activities of the American company GEORGIA-PACIFIC. At the same time,  SCA is making an offer of USD 230 million to acquire the American company TUSCARORA (turnover of USD 285 million with
also 2,200 employees), specialised in the packaging for electronic and industrial products.  SCA is presently on the verge of merging with the Finnish  METSA TISSUE, but this operation seems compromised by a refusal from the European competition authorities which should give their verdict in February.

EC to block SCA Metsa-Tissue  bid

The European Commission says it will block the $640m takeover of  Metsa-Tissue by SCA due to the dominant position of the company in the market. The Commission extended its investigation into the Metsa- Tissue acquisition in September, but has until February 9 to make a decision.

Meanwhile, SCA has reached a definitive agreement to acquire a part of Georgia-Pacific's commercial tissue manufacturing operations for $850m. The sale is expected to be completed during the first quarter of the year, with proceeds being used to repay debt.

Georgia-Pacific agreed to sell its existing commercial tissue business, including some 368,000 tonnes of tissue manufacturing capacity and associated converting facilities, and sales and marketing functions.

"This divestiture will not only comply with our consent decree with the Justice Department, but also is a necessary step forward in Georgia-Pacific's transformation strategy," says AD Correll, chairman and chief executive officer
of Georgia-Pacific.

The operations SCA will acquire were formerly known as Georgia- Pacific Tissue, and include the US factories acquired in a 1999 joint venture with Chesapeake. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, Chesapeake will be entitled to a payment of $218m to cover deferred capital gains.

Georgia-Pacific will retain all commercial tissue facilities acquired in the Fort James transaction. Following the divestiture, Georgia-Pacific will operate approximately 940,000 tons of commercial tissue manufacturing capacity and associated converting facilities. The company also will retain its proprietary commercial tissue dispensing systems and a commercial tissue operation in Mexico.

EU to block SCA/Metsa Tissue deal on Wed-source.

BRUSSELS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The  European Commission will on Wednesday block plans by Swedish paper giant SCA to take control of Finnish tissue-maker  Metsa Tissue, a Commission source said on Monday.
"The deal is doomed," the source told Reuters, adding that the two firms had made insufficient concessions to the
EU competition authority.

The Commission has until February 9 to deliberate on the SCA/Metsa Tissue deal. But the source said the decision to block the deal would be announced on Wednesday, unless the companies decided to withdraw from the planned acquisition.

"They have not come up with the necessary concessions and they are way beyond the deadline for the concessions," the source said.

On September 28, the Commission opened an in-depth probe into Svenska Cellulosa AB's 295 million euro bid for 66 percent of Metsa Tissue Oyi amid concern the deal would create a dominant force in the market for hygienic tissue products, particularly in the Nordic region.

Under EU merger rules, companies have until one month before the probe's deadline - February 9 in this case - to offer concessions to meet EU competition concerns.
The SCA/Metsa Tissue deal is part of a complicated exchange of assets between SCA and Finnish papermaker
Metsa-Serla.

The Commission has already authorised, with conditions, Metsa-Serla's purchase of Modo and SCA Packaging's acquisition of Metsa Corrugated.

SCA said last week it would buy tissue operations worth $850 million from U.S. forestry group Georgia Pacific in a move that analysts said signalled the Swedish group had given up on Metsa Tissue and wanted to branch out on
a different market.

But Metsa-Serla's Chief Executive Jorma Vaajoki said last week the acquisition of the U.S. operations did not indicate SCA was pulling out of its planned purchase of Metsa-Tissue.

"I do not think this deal in the United States and whatever (SCA) would like to do in Europe are connected in any way," Vaajoki told Reuters.

EU Seen Blocking SCA, Metsa Tissue Deal Wed
By Grainne Hehir
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Union Commission is expected to block  Svenska Cellulosa  AAG's
(S.SCA) attempted purchase of Finland's Metsa Tissue Corp. (Y.MTT) at its weekly meeting on Wednesday.

SCA filed additional concessions on Jan. 11 - just before a deadline - to remedy the E.U.'s problems with the deal, but Brussels-based sources say the concessions aren't enough to change the Commission's opinion that the deal would be anticompetitive, particularly in Nordic markets.

"Withdrawing the deal looks like the only way the two companies could avoid the veto," said a Brussels-based antitrust lawyer with a U.K. firm who declined to be named.

National E.U. antitrust experts met on Jan. 16 to give their final opinion on the merger and are understood to have upheld the Commission's recommendation that the deal be blocked.

The Commission had slammed SCA's only previous concessions when it opened an indepth probe into the deal on Sept. 27.
The merged group would have a very high market share for so-called "away from home" hygienic tissue products
- used in hotels, schools and hospitals - in Nordic countries and much of the market in most other E.U. countries,
it said. The remedies offered by SCA didn't "address the problem outside Sweden, Norway and Denmark," the
Commission said. It wasn't even clear whether the remedies offered at that stage would be adequate within
Nordic countries, the Commission said.

In addition, although SCA has only a small market share in Finland, it is the "most credible competitive restraint to an existing duopoly between Metsae Tissue and American company Fort James, each with about half of the
tissue market," the commission said.
The linkup between SCA and Metsae would remove SCA's restraining influence, the Commission added.

In addition, the Commission was skeptical about whether part of the proposal, to split brands on a geographical basis, would work.

SCA filed further concessions in January but these weren't substantially different to those offered in the first phase, these sources say.
SCA officials weren't immediately available to comment.

This isn't the first merger between Scandinavian companies to run into difficulties at the E.U. Commission recently. Earlier this month, Metso Corp. (MX) had to agree to dispose some assets to gain clearance of its purchase of Swedish construction and mineral processing equipment company Svedala Industri AB (S.SVD) after a five-month review. Last year, fellow Scandinavian companies Volvo AB (VOLVY) and Scania AB (S.SCN) were prevented from linking up their truck and bus units, also due to high market shares in Nordic countries.

A veto Wednesday would be only the 14th time the Commission has vetoed a merger or takeover. However, other deals have been substantially amended or withdrawn altogether after Commission objections.

STOCKHOLM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Swedish forestry and hygiene products company  SCA declined to comment on Tuesday on a Reuters report that the  European Commission would block its aqcuisition of Finnish tissue maker Metsa Tissue .

"If this is an unofficial statement from the Commission, they have to confirm it. As long as this is a rumour, we cannot comment on it,"  SCA's chief executive Sverker Martin-Lof told Reuters on Tuesday.

A source told Reuters on Monday the Commission would block the deal because the two firms had made insufficient concessions to the EU competition authority.
On September 28, the Commission opened an in-depth probe into Svenska Cellulosa AB's (SCA) 295 million
euro ($270 million) bid for 66 percent of Metsa Tissue Oyi amid concern the deal would create a dominant force in

Under EU merger rules, companies have until one month before the probe's deadline - February 9 in this case - to offer concessions to meet EU competition concerns.

EU halts Svenska Cellulosa  purchase  of Finland's Metsa Tissue Corp

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Commission on Wednesday blocked the acquisition of Finland's Metsa Tissue Corp. by  SCA Molnyke of Sweden saying the combined companies would dominate the Nordic market leaving consumers too little choice.

"The operation would have created or strengthened a dominant market position in a total of 26 hygienic tissue products in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland," the Commission said in a statement.

It said this would have "severely limited consumer choice for tissue products, such as kitchen towels and toilet paper and would have enabled manufacturers to raise consumer prices."

EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres said the two companies together would have had a 90 percent market share for kitchen towels and toilet rolls and control over the most important Nordic brands.

The move marked the 14th time since 1990 that the European Union executive put the brakes on a merger invoking antitrust concerns.

If the linkup had gone ahead "consumers would have suffered because there would have been no choice of products and there was a real risk they would have put prices up," Torres told reporters.
She said during a four-month EU antitrust investigation, the two companies had the chance to address the
Commission's antitrust concerns but failed to act.

EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres said the two companies together would have had a 90 percent market share in some markets for kitchen towels and toilet rolls and dominate the most important Nordic brands.

The EU's antitrust investigation found "with such a powerful player no competitors would be ready to penetrate the market due to very high investment costs, including the costs of introducing a new brand," said the Commission statement.

Torres said the EU probe focused on the Nordic market alone, not the EU as a whole for the products involved - paper towels, toilet rolls and other such paper goods - cannot be transported over more than 1,000 kilometers (666 miles) and be competitive.

"It was not a surprise to us," SCA's executive vice president Michael Bertorp said about the decision to block the takeover.

"We have had a dialogue with the Commission so the likelihood that deal would be approved was small, despite the major undertakings we made," he said, adding that SCA would not appeal the decision.

Wednesday action marked the 14th time since 1990 the European Union executive put the brakes on a merger out of 1,500 cases it investigated in that period.

Had the linkup had gone ahead "consumers would have suffered because there would have been no choice of products and there was a real risk they would have put prices up," Torres told reporters.

During the four-month EU antitrust investigation, the two companies failed to meet the Commission's antitrust concerns.

"I regret that it was not possible for the merging parties to address the Commission's concerns about reduced competition," EU Antitrust Chief Mario Monti said in the statement.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Commission on Wednesday blocked the acquisition of Finland's Metsa Tissue Corp. by  SCA Molnyke of Sweden saying the new, combined company would dominate the Nordic market leaving consumers too little choice.

The operation, it said in a statement, would have led to a dominant market position in no fewer than 26 hygienic tissue products in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland.

SCA: Acquisition of Metsa Tissue Not Approved by European Commission

(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)
STOCKHOLM, Sweden--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2001--The European Commission announced today that it has not approved SCA's acquisition of the Finnish company Metsa Tissue.

This decision means that the agreement reached on 30 May 2000, through which  SCA acquired a majority shareholding in Metsa Tissue from Metsa-Serla, will not be completed. According to the agreement,  SCA was to pay EUR 295 M for 65% of the shares, corresponding to a debt-free payment for the entire company amounting
to EUR 650 M. The agreement also listed the undertakings to divest certain operations that  SCA was prepared to submit to the Commission, in the event that undertakings were necessary to obtain approval. It was furthermore prescribed that the seller would be entitled to compensation under certain circumstances, if the transaction could not be completed as a result of competition-related obstacles. However, this amount would be a maximum of SEK
150 M.

As part of this matter, SCA submitted its commitments to divest businesses corresponding to some 75% of the acquired operations in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, including Swedish manufacturing units with a combined capacity amounting to approximately 100,000 tons. However, in addition to further concessions in Sweden and Denmark, the Commission demanded that SCA also divest operations in the consumer and AFH area in Finland as a prerequisite for its approval. The Commission's assessment is based on each Nordic country being considered a separate market for consumer and AFH tissue.

A basic aim of the acquisition of Metsa Tissue was to substantially strengthen SCA's position in Finland and complement certain existing market positions in the other Nordic countries. For SCA, acceptance of the Commission's demands would be incompatible with this goal.

The Commission's decision does not affect the terms and conditions of the other transactions for which agreement was reached between SCA and Metsa-Serla on May 30, 2000. These are SCA's sale of 50% of its shares in Modo Paper and SCA's acquisition of Metsa-Serla's European corrugated board operations. Neither does the decision affect SCA's existing minority stake in Metsa Tissue acquired prior to the agreement with Metsa-Serla.

Following is a press release from Moody's Investors Service: London, 31 January 2001 -- Moody's Investors Service has placed the Baa2 ratings for debt issues by
Metsa-Serla Oyj as well as the Prime-2
rating for Metsa-Serla Financial Services Oyj for its guaranteed commercial paper programme on review for possible downgrade following today's announcement by the European Commission that it would block the sale of Metsa-Tissue to SCA.
Ratings under review include:
- the Baa2 rating for the Euro 1.5 billion MTN programme for
Metsa-Serla Oyj
- the Baa2 ratings for note drawings under the MTN programme
- the Baa2 ratings for the $725 million revolving credit facility and the $ 560 million revolving credit facility of Metsa-Serla Oyj
- the Prime-2 rating for Metsa Group Financial Services Oyj guaranteed by Metsa-Serla Oyj for its $200 million ECP programme

Moody's review for downgrade will assess the implications of this blocked divestiture, which was expected to generate approximately Euros 500 million in debt reduction for Metsa-Serla. In particular, we will focus on alternative plans by Metsa-Serla to reduce leverage following the all debt-financed acquisition of Modo Paper. In addition, we will address concerns about the gradual deterioration in the outlook for fine paper pursuant to the recent slowdown in the US economy and some concerns about future price developments.

Metsa-Serla Oyj, domiciled in Helsinki, Finland, is a leading European paper and forestry products group with consolidated 1999 sales of Euros 4.2 billion.

European Commission blocks  SCA's acquisition of Metsa Tissue

Nordic Business Report
NORD
English
Copyright 2001 M2 Communications, Ltd. All Rights Reserved.
The European Commission has decided not to approve the Swedish paper group  SCA Molnlycke's proposed acquisition of the Finnish company  Metsa Tissue.

"The operation would have created or strengthened dominant market positions in a total of 26 hygienic tissue products in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. As such, it would have severely limited consumer choice for tissue products, such as kitchen towels and toilet paper, and would have enabled manufacturers to raise customer prices," the  European Commission stated.

SCA had agreed to divest businesses corresponding to some 75% of the acquired operations in Sweden, Norway and Denmark but in addition to further concessions in Sweden and Denmark the European Commission also demanded that SCA divest operations in the consumer and AFH area in Finland.

SCA regards such further divestments as incompatible with the basic aim of the proposed acquisition, namely to substantially strengthen the company's position in Finland and to complement existing market positions in the other Nordic countries.

As a result of the Commission's opposition to SCA's proposed acquisition of Metsa Tissue, the deal will not be completed. The Commission's decision does not affect other transactions between SCA and Metsa-Serla, such
as SCA's sale of 50% of its shares in Modo Paper and its acquisition of Metsa-Serla's European corrugated board operations.
SCA will also remain a minority shareholder in Metsa Tissue.

BRUSSELS, Jan 31 (AFP) - The European Commission said Wednesday it was blocking acquisition by Swedish papermaker Svenska Cellulosa  of the Metsae-Tissue unit controlled by the Finnish  Metsae-Serla group.

It was only the 14th time that the European Union's executive branch -- which enforces  EU anti-trust laws -- had blocked a takeover, a spokeswoman for EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

"The operation would have created or strengthened a dominant market position in a total of 26 hygienic tissue products in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland," a commission statement said.

"As such it would have severely limited consumer choice for tissue products such as kitchen towels and toilet paper, and would have enabled manufacturers to raise customer prices," it said.

EU Blocks  SCA Buy Of Metsae Tissue

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission said Wednesday it has blocked the acquisition of
Finland's  Metsa Tissue Corp. (Y.MTT) by Sweden's  Svenska Cellulosa SCA AAG (S.SCA).

"The operation would have created or strengthened a dominant market position in a total of 26 hygienic tissue products in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland," the Commission said in a statement.

"It would have severely limited consumer choice for tissue products, such as kitchen towels and toilet paper and would have enabled manufacturers to raise consumer prices."


SCA has an 85% stake in the firm, acquired in several stages since
July last year from Metsae-Serla Oyj (Y.MSR).
- - 31/01/01 11-16G

Competition spokeswoman Amelia Torres said the companies would have had up to a 90% market share for kitchen towels and toilet rolls and control over the most important Nordic brands.
She noted that this is only the 14th time the Commission has blocked a merger since the task force was set up in
1990, but said the E.U. executive had a duty to protect consumers.

If the linkup had gone ahead "consumers would have suffered because there would have been no choice of products and there was a real risk they would have put prices up," she said.

During the four-month in depth probe the companies had the chance to address the commission's competition concerns but hadn't done so.
The companies had offered concessions but they were insufficient.
The Commission said that SCA and Metsa Tissue combined would have had market shares of up to 90% in some
Nordic markets in both toilet paper and kitchen towels.

"This operation would combine SCA's Edet toilet paper and kitchen towels with Metsa Tissue's own well known brands Lambi, Leni and Serla, leaving little room for alternative suppliers," said the Commission.

The buying power of Nordic supermarkets would have been insufficient to restrain the two companies' combined power.

In addition, no competitors would be ready to penetrate the market due to very high investment costs, including the costs of introducing a new brand, the Commission said.

The Commission said it divided the hygenic tissue products market into different categories, such as toilet paper, kitchen towels, handkerchiefs and napkins.

Products for each of these markets can be transported over distances of approximately 800-1000 kilometers, "beyond which supply of the relatively bulky products becomes increasing uneconomical," it said.

The deal would have therefore lead to a single dominant market position in 21 tissue paper markets in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the Commission said.



Page 37 of 62 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It would have also created a duopolistic dominant positions in two tissue product markets in Finland, alongside Fort James of the U.S., and strengthened dominant positions in three product markets in Finland, the Commission added.

During the in-depth probe, the companies submitted the same undertakings as in the initial phase, which had already been rejected as insufficient, the Commission said.

"They didn't address any of the competition issues identified for consumer and AFH tissue products in Finland or for private-label consumer tissue products in Denmark," it said.

Commissioner for Competition Mario Monti said, "I regret it was not possible for the merging parties to address the Commission's concerns about reduced competition despite my official's best efforts."
He added that, "In these circumstances, the Commission had no choice but to prohibit the deal to ensure the
Nordic consumers would continue to benefit from sufficient choice of products at competitive prices."

The Commission said that this is the fourteenth merger it has blocked since 1990, when pan-European reviews began, out of a total of 1,500 cases submitted for regulatory clearance.

"The Commission has been able to clear the overwhelming majority of mergers and acquisitions involving Nordic countries either with or without conditions," it said.

It cited SCA's purchase of Metsa Corrugated and the purchase of Modo Paper by Metsa-Serla, which were both conditionally cleared last year. These latter deals were part of a package of asset transfers between SCA and Metsa Serla, of which the blocked Metsa Tissue deal formed the final part.

The E.U. Commission has come under criticism from Nordic politicians and businesses for considering Nordic markets on a national basis in antitrust reviews, rather than looking at Europe as a whole.

This is unfair to Nordic companies because they traditionally have higher market shares in their relatively remote home markets, they argue.

SCA: Still Aim To Expand Euro Tissue Ops After EU Ruling

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Sweden's Svenska Cellulosa  AB (S.SCA) is studying its options to boost its presence in the European tissue market following the European Union Commission's rejection Wednesday of its proposed acquisition of Metsae Tissue Corp. (Y.MTT).
In a telephone interview,  SCA's Executive Vice President Michael Bertorp said the company won't appeal the
Commission's decision but is considering alternatives to improve its market position, particularly in Finland.
Bertorp said SCA also wants to expand its tissue operations in southern Europe.

In a widely expected decision, the E.U. Commission blocked the proposed acquisition on competition concerns in the Nordic region. "The operation would have created or strengthened a dominant market position in a total of 26 hygienic tissue products in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland," the Commission said in a statement.

"It would have severely limited consumer choice for tissue products, such as kitchen towels and toilet paper, and would have enabled manufacturers to raise consumer prices," it said.

As part of its proposed deal, SCA said it was willing to divest businesses corresponding to 75% of the acquired operations in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. In addition to further concessions in Sweden and Denmark, the Commission demanded that SCA also divest operations in the consumer and so-called away-from-home products in Finland as a prerequisite for its approval, SCA said.

"The Commission's assessment is based on each Nordic country being considered a separate market for consumer and AFH tissue," SCA said.

SCA said the aim of the acquisition was to strengthen its position in Finland and complement existing market position in other Nordic countries. "For SCA, acceptance of the Commission's demands would be incompatible with this goal," SCA said.

Metsae Tissue will continue as a separate listed company on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, Metsae-Serla said in a statement.

EU Blocks  SCA, Metsa Tissue Merger; Swedish Group Seeks Fresh Targets

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission blocked the planned acquisition of Finland's  Metsa Tissue Oyj by Sweden's Svenska Cellulosa  AB after deciding that the deal would allow the Swedish group to dominate the Scandinavian market in forestry and paper-hygiene products.

The planned deal, valued at an estimated 650 million euros ($602.55 million), was part of a complex swap of assets between  SCA, whose products range from tissue to newsprint and which already owns 20% of  Metsa Tissue's shares, and Finland's  Metsa-Serla Oyj, which was ready to transfer the 66% of  Metsa Tissue shares it owns to SCA.

Antitrust regulators investigating on behalf of the commission determined that the deal would have allowed the companies to capture an outsized share of the Nordic market for hygienic-tissue products, such as toilet paper and kitchen towels.

Wednesday's widely expected ruling marks the completion of a second-stage antitrust probe ordered by the commission, which was concerned that the merger would raise barriers to the entry of new competitors in Scandinavia.

SCA had been braced for the ruling since October, when antitrust regulators recommended to the commission that the merger be blocked.
It is only the 14th time the commission has blocked a merger since its antitrust task force was set up in 1990. "The operation would have created or strengthened a dominant market position in a total of 26 hygienic tissue
products in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland," EU competition spokeswoman Amelia Torres said
Wednesday.

Ms. Torres said that the EU executive had a duty to protect consumers. If the link-up had gone ahead, "consumers would have suffered because there would have been no choice of products and there was a real risk they would have put prices up," she said.

"It would have severely limited consumer choice for tissue products, such as kitchen towels and toilet paper, and would have enabled manufacturers to raise consumer prices."

SCA Executive Vice President Michael Bertorp said Wednesday that the company won't appeal the Commission's decision, but is considering alternatives to improve its market position, particularly in Finland. Mr. Bertorp said
SCA also wants to expand its tissue operations in southern Europe.

During the four-month in-depth probe the companies failed to offer sufficient concessions to facilitate the merger's completion. As part of the deal, SCA had said it was willing to divest businesses corresponding to 75% of the acquired operations in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. In addition to asking for further concessions in Sweden and Denmark, the Commission demanded that SCA also divest operations in the consumer and so-called
away-from-home products in Finland as a prerequisite for its approval, SCA said.

On Jan. 23, SCA boosted its North American presence by agreeing to two acquisitions totaling more than $1 billion buying a commercial-tissue unit from Georgia-Pacific Corp. for $850 million and packaging company Tuscarora Inc. for $230 million.

After the ruling Wednesday, SCA lost one Swedish kronor to 213 kronor in trading in Stockholm. In Helsinki, Metsa-Serla lost 0.07 euro to end at 7.53 euros.

EU Commission blocks  Scandinavian tissue deal.
By Lisa Jucca

Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday blocked plans by Swedish paper group SCA to buy Finnish tissue-maker Metsa Tissue, only the 14th time the Brussels regulator has vetoed a deal.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog said it decided to reject the deal as concessions offered by the two firms failed to meet its concerns about the creation of a dominant force in the Nordic market for hygenic tissue products.
"The operation would have created or strengthened a dominant market position in 26 hygenic tissue products in
Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland," the Commission said.

"As such, it would have severely limited customer choice for tissue products such as kitchen towels and toilet paper and would have enabled manufacturers to raise ... prices."

Brussels' red light to the acquisition comes after a four month investigation during which the two parties tried to negotiate remedies to market share concentration in Scandinavia.
Last spring, Svenska Cellulosa AB's launched a 295 billion euro bid for 66 percent of Metsa Tissue Oyi through its
Dutch unit SCA Moelnlycke Holding BV.

Although SCA has only a small market share in Finland, the Commission decided to examine the deal in detail last September as it said SCA was "the most credible competitive restraint to an existing duopoly between Metsa Tissue and (U.S. group) Fort James."

EU concerns were mainly focused on the market for toilet tissues and paper towels, where the merged company looked set to have over 80 percent share in parts of Scandinavia.
The SCA/Metsa Tissue deal is part of a complicated asset exchange between SCA and Finland's Metsa-Serla. The Commission has already authorised, with conditions, Metsa-Serla's purchase of Modo and SCA Packaging's
acquistion of Metsa Corrugated.
SCANDINAVIA UNDER COMMISSION CROSS-FIRE

The blocking of SCA's acquisition of Metsa Tissue is the second prominent Scandinavian deal vetoed by Brussels after the Commission last year blocked a merger between Swedish truckmaker Volvo and rival Scania.

Other mergers involving Scandinavian companies were blocked by the EU's competition authority in the past, such as a deal between Finnish retailers Kesko and Tuko in 1996.
A Nordic satellite distribution joint venture between Norsk Telekom, TeleDanmark and Kinnevick was vetoed in
1995.

Competition experts say that Scandinavian fims have a tradition of building a strong domestic position before entering acquistions and that they rarely venture outside the relatively homogenous Nordic markets.

This gives way to higher risks of regional concentration whenever there is a merger, hence frequent clashes between the Commission and Scandinavian companies.

"In much of Europe, businesses are buying companies outside their region. But in Scandinavia they tend to focus on the Scandinavian geographic area," said Kiran Desai, partner at law firm Rowe & Maw in Brussels.

"These relatively smaller countries are establishing an even stronger Scandinavian base rather than building a truly integrated pan-European business."

HELSINKI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Finnish papermaker  Metsa-Serla said on Wednesday its financial outlook would not be hit by the  European Commission's decision to block the sale of  Metsa-Tissue to Sweden's forestry group SCA .
"This doesn't have any impact on  Metsa-Serla's financial plans or business outlook in any way,"  Metsa-Serla
Deputy Managing Director Veli-Matti Mynttinen told Reuters.

"We will have slightly more loans in our balance sheet, but on the other hand we have cash flow to take care of loans."

The European Union's antitrust watchdog earlier on Wednesday said it decided to reject the deal as concessions offered by the two firms failed to meet its concerns about the creation of a dominant force in the Nordic market for hygenic tissue products.
Last spring, Svenska Cellulosa AB's launched a 295 million euro bid for 66 percent of Metsa-Tissue Oyi , where
Metsa-Serla is a majority shareholder.

Mynttinen said Metsa-Serla had received no other offers to buy Metsa-Tissue. "Apparently there are a few interested buyers, but we haven't been contacted," he said.

STOCKHOLM, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Forest industry group  SCA said on Wednesday the  EU's rejection of its takeover of Finnish tissue maker  Metsa-Tissue would not affect its other deals with the Finnish unit's parent Metsa-Serla .

"The Commission's decision does not affect the terms and conditions of the other transactions for which agreement was reached between  SCA and Metsa-Serla on May 30, 2000," Sweden-based  SCA said in a statement.

SCA will sell 50 percent of its shares in Modo Paper and buy Metsa-Serla's European corrugated board operations - deals already authorised by the European Union's antitrust watchdog.

The EU said it decided to reject SCA's acquisition of Metsa-Tissue after concessions offered by the two firms failed to meet its concerns about the creation of a dominant force in the Nordic market for hygenic tissue products.

Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland," the Commission said.

EU concerns were mainly focused on the market for toilet tissues and paper towels, where the merged company looked set to have market share over 80 percent in parts of Scandinavia.
SCA said the EU rejection meant its planned 295 million euro ($274.3 million) purchase of 65 percent of shares in
Metsa-Tissue agreed last spring would not be completed.

A basic aim of the acquisition had been to strengthen SCA's position in Finland and complement market positions in other Nordic countries, the company said.
"For SCA, acceptance of the Commission's demands would be incompatible with this goal," it said.
At 1210 GMT, SCA's share was 0.7 percent down at 212.50 crowns, slightly underperforming Nordic and
European peers.
In Helsinki, Metsa-Serla was 1.3 percent off at 7.50 euros. Document lba0000020010713dx1v07da7

BRUSSELS, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday blocked plans by Swedish paper
giant SCA to buy Finnish tissue-maker Metsa Tissue, only the 14th time the Brussels regulator has vetoed a deal.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog said it decided to reject the deal after concessions offered by the two Scandinavian groups failed to meet is competition concerns about dominance in Nordic markets for certain paper products.

"I regret it was not possible for the merging parties to address the Commission's concerns about competition despite my officials' best efforts," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

"... the Commission had no choice but to prohibit the deal to ensure that Nordic consumers would continue to benefit from sufficient choice of products at competitive prices."

The Commission said it halted the deal as the purchase would reinforce the firms' strong position in the hygenic tissues market in Scandinavia and consequently limit customers' choice.
The Commission said its analysis showed the deal would have led to market shares of up to 90 percent in some
Nordic markets.
"The operation would have created or strengthened a dominant market position in 26 hygenic tissue products in
Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland," the Commission said.

"As such, it would have severely limited customer choice for tissue products such as kitchen towels and toilet paper and would have enabled manufacturers to raise ... prices."
TISSUE DEAL ENDS UP IN SMOKE

Brussels' red light to the acquisition comes after a four month investigation during which the two parties tried to negotiate remedies to market share concentration in Scandinavia.
Last May, Svenska Cellulosa AB launched a 295 million euro ($274.7 million) bid for 66 percent of Metsa Tissue
Oyi through its Dutch unit SCA Moelnlycke Holding BV.

SCA said it had forged the deal in order to strengthen its position in Finland and complement market positions in other Nordic countries, but added the Commission's requests would have frustrated its aims.

"For SCA, acceptance of the Commission's demands would be incompatible with this goal," the company said in a statement.

Metsa-Serla, a majority shareholder of Metsa Tissue, said the Commission's decision would not hit its financial outlook.

"The operation would have created or strengthened a dominant market position in a total of 26 hygienic-tissue products in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland," the commission said in a statement.

"It would have severely limited consumer choice for tissue products, such as kitchen towels and toilet paper and would have enabled manufacturers to raise consumer prices."
SCA has an 85% stake in the firm, acquired in several stages since July last year from Metsae-Serla Oy. Competition spokeswoman Amelia Torres said the companies would have had up to a 90% market share for
kitchen towels and toilet rolls and control over the most important Nordic brands.

The European Commission, the  European Union's executive body, blocked a takeover of the Finnish paper producer Metsa Tissue by its Swedish competitor  SCA Molnlycke. The deal would have stifled competition in the Scandinavian toilet-paper and paper-towel markets, the regulator said. With a combined market share as high as
90 percent in some markets, the commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, said he had no choice. It was the
14th merger or takeover to be blocked by the commission in more than 10 years, out of more than 1,500 cases it
has examined.

EU/COMPETITION - COMMISSION BLOCKS ACQUISITION OF METSAe TISSUE BY SCA MOeLNLYCKE.

1 February 2001
Agence Europe
AGEU
English
(c) 2001 Agence EUROPE, Brussels Not Available for Re-dissemination. .
Brussels, 31/01/2001 (Agence  Europe) - After a detailed inquiry lasting four months, the  European Commission has decided to block the acquisition of the Finnish tissue paper manufacturer  Metsae Tissue by its Swedish rival, SCA Moelnlycke.

This decision is very rare, stressed the spokesman's service charged with this file, as the Commission has only blocked thirteen operations since 1900 out of the 1500 notified, as problematical transactions have mainly been resolved after commitments agreed between the companies involved and the Community Executive. The operation that has just been blocked by the Commission was part of a complex transaction comprising three sections, two of which had been cleared with conditions (the acquisition of Modo by Metsae-Serla and the acquisition of Metsae Corrugated by SCA Packaging - see EUROPE of 12 August, p.3, and 28/29 August, p.6). The deal refused would have conferred exclusive control of Metsae Tissue Corp to SCA, allowing the creation or strengthening of dominant positions on the markets of 26 hygiene tissue paper products in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. This situation would considerably limit consumer choice for this kind of product, mainly for kitchen towels and toilet paper, with, as a result, an inevitable rise in prices. The new group arising from this merger would have held very high market shares of up to 90% in some sectors throughout the northern region, thus pushing out other suppliers whose purchasing power would have been insufficient to offset the situation.

Furthermore, other possible suppliers wishing to gain a foothold on the market or launch a new brand would have been discouraged from doing so given the exceedingly high investment costs involved. In concrete terms, the move would have given rise to:
a) the creation of individual dominant positions on 21 tissue paper product markets in Sweden, Norway and
Denmark;

b) the creation of a duopolistic dominant position in two tissue product markets in Finland (between the merged entity and Fort James of the United States), and
c) the strengthening of dominant positions in three product markets in Finland.

During the second part of the inquiry, the parties had submitted to the Commission the same commitments that they had already proposed during the first phase, namely the sale of certain assets. These were not, however, considered sufficient as, on one hand, they did not resolve the competition problems for certain products, and, on the other, they would not have allowed their eventual buyer to effectively compete with the entity formed from the operation.

Commissioner Monti regretted that the parties had not managed to qualm the fears expressed by his services, leaving the Commission no alternative but to ban the operation.

EU Commission Blocks

Metsa-SCA Merger

BRUSSELS -- As expected, the European Commission on Wednesday blocked the acquisition of Finland's Metsa Tissue Corp. by SCA Molnyke of Sweden saying the new, combined company would dominate the Nordic market leaving consumers too little choice.

The operation, it said in a statement, would have led to a dominant market position in no fewer than 26 hygienic-tissue products in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. It added this would have severely limited consumer choice for tissue products, such as kitchen towels and toilet paper and would have enabled manufacturers to raise consumer prices. EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres said the two companies together would have had a 90% market share in some markets for kitchen towels and toilet rolls and dominate the most important Nordic brands. (AP)

Electrabel to Cut Jobs

BRUSSELS -- Electrabel SA said it will cut approximately 1,700 jobs from its current level of 15,235 by 2003, as part of a reorganization to make the company more competitive. Electrabel said that positions which were no longer part of its four core activities -- production, trading, network management and sales -- would be targeted. The company said a comprehensive reorientation program would be set up for a number of staff members who occupied other positions outside of the company's core activities. (Dow Jones)

Accor Revenue Rises

PARIS -- Accor SA said Wednesday that a strong fourth quarter drove its consolidated revenue for 2000 up 15% to 7.01 billion euros from 6.10 billion euros a year earlier. Stripping out currency exchange fluctuations, Accor said the revenues growth rate for the year was 6.6%, in line with analysts' expectations. The company noted fourth-quarter revenue, lifted by a strong performance in its U.S. economy-class hotels division, grew 18% in the
year to 1.85 billion euros from 1.57 billion euros a year ago, compared with a 9.8% expansion in the third quarter. (Dow Jones)

Corus Blasted for Closings

LONDON -- The U.K. government's chief press spokesman Wednesday criticized Corus Group PLC for an inadequate flow of information about planned plant closures, which could result in 7,000 job losses. The privatized steelmaker is planning to close the Llanwern factory in South Wales, one of the biggest employers in the region, and the blast furnace at Teeside in the northeast of the U.K. In response, Corus spokeman Michael Hitchcock
said Corus had kept "in close touch with the Department of Trade and Industry, the Welsh Assembly and several MPs (Members of Parliament." The Corus chairman also met Prime Minister Tony Blair last week, Mr. Hitchcock said. Alastair Campbell, official spokesman for the Prime Minister, said that although there have been meetings between the government and the company, Corus hasn't provided as much information as other companies do before announcing mass job losses.

Outokumpu Meets Expectations

STOCKHOLM -- Finnish metal and steel company Outokumpu Oyj reported fourth-quarter pretax profit in line with market expectations but said it expects the market for stainless steel to stay weak in the first half. The company said pretax profit for the fourth quarter rose 18% to 72 million euros from 61 million euros in the year-earlier
period. Analysts polled by forecasting service SME Direkt had expected a fourth-quarter pretax profit of 72 million euros. Sales amounted to 991 million euros for the period, up from 865 euros, primarily because of higher metal prices and a stronger U.S. dollar. Operating profit increased to 86 million euros from 74 million euros. (Dow Jones)

Bulgari's Sales Rise 40%
MILAN -- Italian jewelry group Bulgari SpA released preliminary consolidated sales figures for 2000 showing a
40% rise on the previous year to a record 680 million euros from 485 million euros in 1999. The sales were in line
with analysts' estimates of a rise of between 38% to 44% from 1999. Bulgari said in 2000 sales increased in all
geographical areas, up 55% in the Far East, 40% in Italy and the Middle East, up 35% in Japan and the rest of
Europe and up 30% in the U.S. Revenue was also higher in all products. The sale of jewels rose 45%, while
watches were up 40%, perfume rose 25% and accessories were 50% higher. (Dow Jones)

Discounter Will Close Units

FRANKFURT -- Cash-strapped German online discounter LetsBuyit.com said Wednesday it will close some country operations and let go 200 of its 350 employees. Management remains in talks with potential investors, together with its court-appointed trustee, after a Dutch court granted the Neuer Markt-listed company a temporary reprieve to try to save it from bankruptcy. The company was able to raise 4 million euros for a stay of execution last week, and is hoping to raise another 50 million euros to get back on its feet. (Dow Jones)

The European Commission announced on 31 January it was blocking the proposed takeover of Finnish tissue paper manufacturer  Metsa Tissue by its Swedish competitor  SCA Molnlycke on competition grounds. The present merger case forms part of an extensive exchange of assets between Metsa-Serla and Svenska Cellulosa  AB, the parent company of  SCA. Two other deals, the acquisition of Metsa Corrugated by SCA and Modo Paper by Metsa-Serla, were cleared by the  European Commission with conditions, last year.
High market shares.

The Commission's careful analysis of the SCA/Metsa Tissue merger showed very high market shares (up to 90% in some markets) throughout the entire Nordic region (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland) for toilet paper and kitchen towels.

The deal would combine SCA's Edet toilet paper and kitchen towels with Metsa Tissue's own well known brands Lambi, Leni and Serla, leaving little room for alternative suppliers. The Commission found that Nordic supermarkets' countervailing buyer power would be insufficient to restrain the merged company's market power. The investigation also showed that with such a powerful player no competitors would be ready to penetrate the market due to very high investment costs, including the costs of introducing a new brand.Hygienic tissue products can be divided into different categories, such as toilet paper, kitchen towels, handkerchiefs and napkins. These products are either sold through retailers ("consumer products") or to corporate customers, such as hotels, schools, hospitals, etc. ("Away-from-home products" - AFH). The two Nordic companies and most other tissue manufacturers have developed their own branded products but also supply supermarkets and other large consumers with private-label products. Tissue products can be transported over distances of approximately
800-1,000 kilometres, beyond which supply of the relatively bulky products becomes increasingly uneconomical.Commission's investigation showed that the transaction would lead to single dominant positions in
21 tissue paper markets in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, to duopolistic dominant positions in two tissue product markets in Finland between the merged entity and Fort James of the United States - and to the strengthening of dominant positions in three product markets in Finland.

During the second-stage (in-depth) investigation under the Merger Regulation, the companies re-submitted undertakings already offered in first phase. These undertakings, which included the divestiture of certain assets, had already been rejected in Phase I of the probe as they did not address any of the competition issues identified for consumer and AFH tissue products in Finland or for private-label consumer tissue products in Denmark. Furthermore, the proposed divestment package contained insufficient capacity in a number of product markets for the buyer to compete effectively with the merged entity and to effectively restrain SCA's market power in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland.This is only the 14th time the Commission has prohibited a merger since the Merger Regulation (4064/89) came into force in 1990, of a total of over 1,500 cases notified for regulatory clearance in the past ten years, and clearly this a decision of the last resort when the companies did not or insufficiently addressed the Commission's legitimate concerns about creation or strengthening of dominant positions.

Metsa Tissue sees 2001 profit.

HELSINKI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Finnish tissue paper maker  Metsa Tissue, which saw its planned sale to Swedish SCA scuttled last week by the  European Commission, on Monday reported a 2000 loss but said it would return to the black this year.

Metsa Tissue, a subsidiary of  Metsa Serla , posted a 2000 loss before extraordinary items of 21.7 million euros ($20.39 million), more than reversing a profit of 9.1 million in 1999. But fourth-quarter losses slimmed to just 2.5 million euros after January-September losses of 19.2 million.

"The financial result was affected by the sharp rise in raw material costs, which was covered by raising product prices only after a certain delay," Metsa Tissue said. "As a result of these price rises and development projects the Group expects to make a clear profit in 2001."

The EC on Wednesday blocked SCA's $275-million bid for the 66-percent stake in Metsa Tissue held by main owner Metsa-Serla on the grounds that it would lead to dominance in the Nordic markets for certain paper products.

Despite the collapse of the acquisition - which marked only the 14th time Brussels has vetoed a deal - SCA still holds a 19.3-percent stake in Metsa Tissue.

UPDATE 1-Metsa Tissue posts 2000 loss, sees return to black.

HELSINKI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Finnish tissue paper maker  Metsa Tissue, which saw its planned sale to Swedish SCA scuttled last week by the  European Commission, on Monday reported a 2000 loss but said it would return to the black this year.

Metsa Tissue, a subsidiary of  Europe's third biggest paper and board maker  Metsa-Serla , posted a 2000 loss before extraordinary items of 21.7 million euros ($20.39 million), more than reversing a profit of 9.1 million in
1999.

The fourth-quarter loss of 2.5 million euros came on top of January-September losses of 19.2 million, widening slightly from the third-quarter's 1.6-million negative result but narrowing from heavier losses in the first half.

"The financial result was affected by the sharp rise in raw material costs, which was covered by raising product prices only after a certain delay," Metsa Tissue said in a statement. "As a result of these price rises and development projects the Group expects to make a clear profit in 2001."
The firm's loss per share was 0.64 euros, versus a 1999 gain of 0.11 per share. Turnover rose four percent to
609.2 million euros ($572.6 million).

The company was affected by a steep rise in costs of its key raw materials, with pulp prices up by almost 45 percent during the year and waste-paper prices up especially in continental Europe, Metsa Tissue said.

"Between early autumn 1999 and the end of 2000, the rise in raw material costs corresponded to almost 25 percent of Metsa Tissue's turnover," it said.
The EC on Wednesday blocked SCA's $275-million bid for the 66-percent stake in Metsa Tissue held by parent
Metsa-Serla on the grounds that it would lead to dominance in the Nordic markets for certain paper products.

Despite the collapse of the acquisition - which marked only the 14th time Brussels has vetoed a deal - SCA still holds a 19.3-percent stake in Metsa Tissue.

"Metsa Tissue will continue to operate as an independent listed company," it said. "Measures to revitalize activities and raise efficiency, which were held back by the acquisition process, will now go ahead immediately."
The relatively illiquid share - 85 percent of shares are held by Metsa-Serla and SCA - was untraded on the
Helsinki bourse by 1120 GMT, after closing at 9.50 euros on February 1.

EC blocks  SCA's #407m takeover of Metsa Tissue.

The European Commission has blocked SCA's #407m (E640m) takeover of  Metsa Tissue because it would have created too strong a position in the Scandinavian markets.

The merger is only the fourteenth deal to have been blocked by the Commission, and follows a four-month investigation into the deal.

The Commission felt that the merger would have severely limited customer choice in products and enabled manufacturers to raise prices.
The deal would have resulted in the merged company gaining a market share of over 80% in parts of
Scandinavia.
SCA said it may have to pay up to #95.5m in compensation to the seller of the Tissue stake, Metsa-Serla. SCA had agreed to buy 65% of the shares in Metsa-Tissue in a deal agreed last spring.
The EC's decision does not in any way affect the acquisition of MoDo Paper, or the subsequent break up of
Metsa-Serla's corrugated board operations.
Metsa-Serla may now look at divesting some of its businesses following the debt-financed acquisition of MoDo
Paper.

SCA will still sell 50% of its shares in MoDo and buy Metsa-Serla's corrugated board operations, with both deals already approved by the EC.
