In Portugal, power grid operator REN (Rede Electrica Nacional) has warned that dominant power group Electricidade de Portugal (EDP) would be vulnerable to a hostile takeover bid from one of its Spanish rivals, Iberdrola and Endesa. REN says that the  European Commission's decision to block  EDP's acquisition of the gas division of Portuguese oil company Galp has left the company in a weakened position in comparison with its Spanish rivals in terms of the planned Hispano-Portuguese energy market.
Iberdrola owns a 5 per cent stake in  EDP. Other shareholders include the Portuguese state, with 16 per cent, and
Caixa Geral, the Portuguese savings bank with links to the government, with 9.8 per cent. Yesterday,  EDP's
share price fell 0.45 per cent to 2.22  euros.

LISBON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Energias de Portugal (EDP) (EDPP.IN), hit by  European Commission disapproval of a takeover of natural  gas assets, should finish a study on alternatives this quarter, Chief Executive Joao Talone said on Tuesday.

The plans would prepare  EDP to serve clients with natural  gas and power like other  European utilites, including those in neighbouring Spain, he said.

"At the end of the first quarter, I hope to have the work complete, the business concept wrapped up," Talone told reporters at a presentation on new EDP shops.

The European Commission last month barred EDP and Italian energy group Eni (ENI.MI) from buying Gas de Portugal, the Iberian country's main gas dealer. The Commission said the deal would strangle the benefits of power liberalization.

EDP would have taken over 51 percent of Gas de Portugal as part of Portugal's efforts to prepare the electricity company for a single Iberian power market. Talone said there was no reason for the Commission to turn down the deal and EDP was studying whether to appeal the decision.
"The fundamental issue now is to go forward and find alternatives," he said. Document LBA0000020050104e11400n85

EU merger policy  may lead to “European champions”, says commissioner

The EU industry commissioner Günther Verheugen has called for review of the  European Commission’s stance on mergers as a means of promoting industrial “champions”, if the emergence of such companies would be in the interest of  Europe as a whole. Verheugen’s comments, made in an interview with French newspaper Le Monde, come just weeks after the  EU blocked the merger between Energias de Portugal (EDP) and Gas de Portugal (GDP) amid concerns over the impact of the union on consumer prices (see EDEM 8.227). However, he would
not be drawn on whether he believed reforms to the  EU’s anti-trust policy were essential. Verheugen added that the EU’s competition policy remained one of its “jewels” and that the continued independence of the competition authority was “vital”.

He stressed that he believed the EU’s newly appointed competition commissioner Neelie Kroes was not opposed to large companies in principle, provided that market dominance did not arise from state subsidies — but rather
as a result of their market position. CL

Expansion: Iberdrola  ups stake in EDP (Iberdrola  aumenta al 5,7% su presencia  en EDP pero descarta una opa hostil).

Spanish power company Iberdrola invested 60m  euros in the recent share issue carried out by Portuguese rival Energias de Portugal (EDP), increasing its stake in the company from 5 to 5.7 per cent. Iberdrola has declared that the rise does not herald the start of a hostile takeover bid, which, the company believes, would be impossible in any case due to the 26 per cent stake in  EDP owned directly and indirectly by the Portuguese state.

Nonetheless, there are fears in Portugal that Iberdrola might be planning a hostile bid for  EDP, in which it is the leading private shareholder. Iberdrola's right to a seat on the EDP board of directors has long been vetoed.  EDP is seen to have been weakened by the European Commission's decision to block its plans to acquire gas company Gas de Portugal. Yesterday, EDP rose 0.44 per cent on the stock market, closing at 2.26 euros, while Iberdrola fell 1.07 per cent to 18.4 euros.
