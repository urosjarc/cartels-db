General Electric  faces European hurdle in Honeywell merger bid.

General Electric  has been defending its proposed $41 billion  merger with Honeywell  in hearings at the
European Commission in Brussels on 29/30 May.

The deal has been given the go-ahead by the USA conditional on minor concessions in its helicopter engine businesses, leaving  European approval  as the last hurdle.

Thales, Rockwell Collins, Rolls-Royce, United Technologies and Lufthansa were among thosegiving presentations to the EC.

The prime battleground for GE and the EC centres on European concerns over the possible anti-competitive impact of bundling products by the merged companies. Overlap in the regional engines market is also an issue.

'Bundling' refers to a wide-ranging package of services which diversified companies can offer. The EC fears a combined GE-Honeywell would offer 'bundles' of aerospace goods and services, including financing, which could squeeze out potential competitors.

Prior to the hearings EC sources indicated that GE could find it "difficult to find ways to remedy the bundling issues identified by the EC. GE believes it could be settled by behavioural arrangements, for example by pricing each element in a package separately, and have been trying to win the support of their customers for this approach.This will not eliminate our worries as an overall framework remains in place."
Brussels will rule on the merger by 12 July.o. Document fligi00020010711dx65000tk

DAVID BRANCACCIO, anchor: The Wall Street Journal is reporting that General Electric  has offered to sell regional jet engine business that it owns in order to get European approval  for its merger with Honeywell.  The European Union has antitrust concerns. Together, GE and Honeywell  control 90 percent of the market for engines used on smaller, shorter-hop jets.

Interview: Philip Shishkin, The Wall Street Journal Europe, discusses GE seeking European regulatory

SUE HERERA, co-anchor: They are also watching this deal very closely. General Electric,  the parent of this network, is ready to sell the regional jet engine business of its  merger partner Honeywell,  that in order to help win the approval  of European regulators. Philip Shishkin of The Wall Street Journal Europe reported the story and he joins us now from Brussels with details.
Nice to have you with us, Philip. So tell us about this shift in  GE's strategy to get the green light.

Mr. PHILIP SHISHKIN (The Wall Street Journal Europe): Well, first of all, we have to realize that antitrust negotiations are always somewhat of a poker game. And GE has been keeping its cards pretty closely to itself and has been revealing antitrust concessions step by step. And the biggest offer came today, just barely hours ago, when GE realized that they will have to actually sell something, not just make promises about its future business contact--conduct to gain antitrust approval. The easiest thing from the antitrust point of view to get rid of related to the GE-Honeywell mergers is or--is Honeywell's original jet engine business.
HERERA: Now does it guarantee the green light, though, or will there have to be more concessions?

Mr. SHISHKIN: Well, in next few days there will be close negotiations between the commission and--and--and the companies. The thing is that this original jet engine divestiture goes a long way toward securing antitrust
approval, but there are other major issues that still remain unresolved. The biggest one is the role of the market power of General Electric Capital Aviation Services, which is one of the biggest aircraft buying and financing arms. And GE has used it extensively, in the eyes of the commission, to win engine contracts for its planes, so much so that the commission has alleged that GECAS is sort of a Trojan horse that GE has used to--to beat out its rivals, such as Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney of UTC.

HERERA: Now GE CEO Jack Welch is headed to Brussels at the end of the week. What's on the agenda for him?

Mr. SHISHKIN: Well, I think the agenda is shifting constantly, and the agenda will depend pretty much on how much GE lawyers and advisers will be able to accomplish in the next few days. I think what will--what will happen, what we'll see, is that GE's negotiators will go back to the commission tomorrow, and the day after on Thursday, and they will try to actually hammer out some sort of an agreement so that Jack Welch, when he comes here on Friday, can actually cut a deal with Mr. Monte.
HERERA: All right.
Mr. SHISHKIN: But--so that--that remains to be seen what exactly the commission and the lawyers will do. HERERA: OK, Philip...
Mr. SHISHKIN: I'm pretty sure it will involve GECAS.
HERERA: Thank you very much, Philip Shishkin of The Wall Street Journal Europe.
RON INSANA (Co-anchor): Stay tuned. When we come back, the winning streak on Wall Street. In our Stock In
Trade, we'll give you the lowdown on what's behind the market's recent rally.

HERERA: And more on Lucent. What's ahead for that company? Has it decided to go it alone? David Faber with his report.

GE comes up with new offer as time runs out to win EU approval  for Honeywell  deal

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - General Electric  Co. chief executive Jack Welch flies to Brussels this week in a final bid to win European Union approval  for his dlrs 41 billion  merger deal with Honeywell  International, bringing
with him an offer to divest part of the business.

With a Tuesday deadline for offering concessions fast approaching, GE has indicated it is prepared to sell off Honeywell's  regional-jet engine business to satisfy concerns of EU regulators, according to a source close to the negotiations.
The proposal was initially reported in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal.

EU regulators cited regional jet engines as one of their top concerns when it launched an in-depth probe of the deal last March, saying the deal was "likely to significantly reduce the existing degree of competition in this market."

GE and Honeywell are two of the main engine suppliers to makers of increasingly popular regional jets, which carry up to 90 passengers on short haul flights. Honeywell also supplies components to competing
engine-makers.

Welch was expected to fly to Brussels for meetings with EU regulators on Friday, another source said. No public statement was planned.
A spokeswoman for Competition Commissioner Mario Monti refused to comment on any aspect of the case. The
EU decision is due July 12.

Resolution of the regional jet engine problem would still leave another major concern cited by Monti's office: the likelihood that GE and Honeywell could bundle aircraft-engines and avionics and sell them at discounts competitors like Britain's Rolls Royce PLC and France's Thales SA couldn't match.
Analysts have said, however, that they don't believe that concern would be a deal-buster.

In return for its approval, the U.S. Justice Department required Honeywell to divest its helicopter-engine business and authorize new third-party maintenance and repair services for some of its aircraft engines.

With a Tuesday deadline for offering concessions fast approaching, GE has indicated it is prepared to sell off Honeywell's  regional-jet engine business to satisfy concerns of EU regulators, according to a source close to the negotiations speaking on condition of anonymity.

EU regulators cited regional jet engines as one of their top concerns when it launched an in-depth probe of the deal last March, saying the deal was "likely to significantly reduce the existing degree of competition in this market."

Fairfield, Conn.-based GE and Honeywell are two of the main engine suppliers to makers of increasingly popular regional jets, which carry up to 90 passengers on short-haul flights. Honeywell also supplies components to competing engine-makers.

Welch was expected to fly to Brussels for meetings with EU regulators on Friday, another source said, also asking not to be identified. No public statement was planned.
A spokeswoman for Competition Commissioner Mario Monti refused to comment on any aspect of the case. The
EU decision is due July 12.

Analysts said such a sale would have little impact on the deal since GE Aircraft is already the leader in that market, with top positions at three of the four manufacturers: Canada's Bombardier Inc., Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica of Brazil; and U.S.-based Fairchild Dornier.

Credit Suisse First Boston estimated revenue from Honeywell's regional jet engine business at only $300 million a year, or less than 0.5 percent of the combined revenues of the two companies.

Resolution of the regional jet engine problem would still leave another major concern cited by Monti's office: the likelihood that GE and Honeywell could bundle aircraft-engines and avionics and sell them at discounts competitors like Britain's Rolls Royce PLC and France's Thales SA couldn't match.

Analysts have said that they don't believe that concern alone would be a deal-buster. Nor do they expect GE to agree to shedding any of its core business, such as avionics or its aircraft financing and leasing business, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS).

Simon Holmes, an EU competition lawyer at SJ Berwin in London, said he expected GE would have to address the Commission's concerns that "bundling" engines and avionics along with financing packages would harm competition.
"GE will have to bite the bullet in terms of divestiture if they want the deal to go through," he said.



Page 10 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But Michael Regan of Credit Suisse First Boston said that while GECAS and GE Aircraft Engines work together, "they work at arms length and there is no cross subsidization of one or the other - so an agreement to make that clear and definable should be easy to reach."

"The EU is posturing to look like it is taking a hard line on the deal and the sale of regional engines and behavioral agreements around GECAS should suffice," he added in a research note.

In return for its approval, the U.S. Justice Department required Honeywell to divest its helicopter-engine business and authorize new third-party maintenance and repair services for some of its aircraft engines.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - General Electric  Co. is prepared to sell  Honeywell  International's regional
jet-engine business to secure European Union approval  for its proposed $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell,  a
source close to the negotiations said Wednesday.

GE chief executive Jack Welch was expected to discuss the concession to  EU regulators later this week in
Brussels, according to the source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The proposal was initially reported in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal.

EU regulators cited regional jet engines as one of their top concerns after launching an in-depth probe of the deal last March, saying the deal was "likely to significantly reduce the existing degree of competition in this market." The deadline is Tuesday for offering concessions.
GE and Honeywell are two of the main engine suppliers for increasingly popular regional jets, which carry up to
90 passengers on short-haul flights. Honeywell also supplies components to competing engine-makers.

Welch was expected to fly to Brussels for meetings with EU regulators on Friday, said another source, also speaking on condition of not being identified.
Welch declined to comment on the matter following a speech Wednesday to the Harvard Business School in
Boston.

A spokeswoman for Competition Commissioner Mario Monti and a spokeswoman for GE declined comment on the case. The EU decision is due July 12.
Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane would say only that company officials are "continuing to work with the
European Commission to address the issues they raised."

Analysts said a sale of Honeywell's regional jet-engine business would have little impact on the deal since GE Aircraft is already the leader in that market, with top positions at three of the four manufacturers: Canada's Bombardier Inc., Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica of Brazil; and U.S.-based Fairchild Dornier.

Credit Suisse First Boston estimated revenue from the Honeywell unit at only $300 million a year, or less than 0.5 percent of the combined revenues of the two companies.

Resolution of that issue would still leave another major concern cited by Monti's office. GE and Honeywell could bundle aircraft engines and electronic aircraft devices, known as avionics, and sell them at discounts that competitors such as Britain's Rolls Royce PLC and France's Thales SA could not match.

Analysts have said that they don't believe that concern alone would be a deal-buster. Nor do they expect GE to agree to shedding any of its core business, such as avionics or its aircraft financing and leasing business, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS).

Simon Holmes, an EU competition lawyer at SJ Berwin in London, said he expected GE would have to address the Commission's concerns that "bundling" engines, avionics along with financing packages would harm competition.
"GE will have to bite the bullet in terms of divestiture if they want the deal to go through," he said.

But Michael Regan of Credit Suisse First Boston said the GE aviation service business and engine business "work at arms length and there is no cross subsidization of one or the other - so an agreement to make that clear and definable should be easy to reach."

"The EU is posturing to look like it is taking a hard line on the deal and the sale of regional engines and behavioral agreements around GECAS should suffice," he added in a research note.

In return for its approval, the U.S. Justice Department required Honeywell to divest its helicopter-engine business and authorize new third-party maintenance and repair services for some of its aircraft engines.
In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares were off 43 cents to close at $48.75, while
Honeywell shares were unchanged at $48.84.

`Fortune`:  GE, Honeywell  Prepared to Make Concessions for EU MergerApproval

DAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNNfn ANCHOR, AHEAD OF THE CURVE: In its  merger with Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) , General Electric  (URL: http://www.ge.com/) is reportedly prepared to make some concessions in exchange for European Commission approval.  Meantime, new laws taking effect in  Europe aim to regulate cross-border takeover bids.
Janet Guyon, editor-at-large for "Fortune" magazine, joins us now from London with details. Hi, Janet. What`s the latest on this General Electric-Honeywell front?
JANET GUYON, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, "FORTUNE": Well, the GE-Honeywell front is heating up. Jack Welch is coming over on Friday to Brussels to meet with EU officials to try to push through that $42 billion merger with Honeywell, and he`s going to face a tough time. In the EU, they are very concerned that GE, with the Honeywell acquisition, will dominate the global market for aircraft engines and aircraft parts -- avionics, electronics --and that they do this through their finance division, GE Capital.

So it`s not clear what the EU`s going to push for. Some reports are saying that they`re going to push for the finance unit to report separately so they can`t use their financing power to push aircraft buyers into using GE engines. And there are other reports that GE has said that they will sell the regional jet business -- that`s jet engines for small jets that seat about 90 people. So there are two reports out about compromise on this. But I think it`s going to be a tough sell.

Now, I talked to a GE official in Fairfield, Connecticut, this morning -- got her out of bed. And she said the company has no comment on this.

But I have to say, given the tone of things here in Europe, I think Jack Welch is going to have a tough time getting a compromise that will be workable for the company out of Brussels this week.

HAFFENREFFER: Yes, I was going to say, how receptive might he be to the European regulators ideas of things that they might need to divest?

GUYON: Well, hopefully, he`s gotten a little bit more conciliatory. Several months ago, when he first landed in Brussels, he took a very high-handed attitude, and it really did irritate the commission. He seemed to think that he could just roll this deal right through. But I think he`s probably going to have to sell a few businesses. I`m not sure whether just separating out the GE aircraft financing business from everything else is going to work.
HAFFENREFFER: Janet, thank you very much. Janet Guyon, "Fortune" magazine, for us, in London.

General Electric  Co. chief executive Jack Welch will deliver a new offer here this week in a final bid to win
European Union approval  for GE's $41 billion merger deal with Honeywell  International.

With a Tuesday deadline for offering concessions, GE has indicated it is prepared to sell  Honeywell's  regional-jet engine business to satisfy concerns of EU regulators, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity.

EU regulators cited regional jet engines as one of their top concerns after launching an in-depth probe of the deal last March, saying the deal was "likely to significantly reduce the existing degree of competition in this market."

GE's aircraft engines division, based in Evendale, and Honeywell are two of the main engine suppliers for increasingly popular regional jets, which carry up to 90 passengers on short haul flights.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ General Electric  Co. chief executive Jack Welch flies to Brussels this week in a final bid to win European Union approval  for his $41 billion US  merger deal with Honeywell  International, bringing with him an offer to divest part of the business.

'Financial Times': GE May Make Larger-Than-Expected Concessions for Honeywell Merger Approval

Ian Rodger of "Financial Times" notes that in exchange for necessary  European Commission approval  of a
merger with Honeywell,  General Electric  may have to make more concessions than it had expected.

DAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNN ANCHOR: In exchange for necessary EuropeanCommission approval, General Electric  may find itself making more concessions than expected, the "Financial Times" reporting this morning that GE may have to let go of its aircraft leasing arm.
Ian Rodger joins us now, live from the "Financial Times" in London. Ian, what is the EC's goal in this process?
IAN RODGER, INTERNATIONAL NEWS EDITOR, "FINANCIAL TIMES": Well, the EC has always had this bee in its bonnet about what it calls bundling, i.e., if you agree to buy the avionics package, then we'll send you the engine cheaper -- and it's been trying to do this from the beginning. The surprise to me is that they're being as tenacious as they are, because, as you know, the Department of Justice in the United States has signed off on
this deal, and the Europeans are still going for more.

HAFFENREFFER: And now we understand that Jack Welch is going over to Europe later this week. Is he likely to receive these suggestions from the European regulators with open arms, or is he going to try to resist some of the ideas?

RODGER: GE has already made what they call behavioral undertakings, where they promise they won't do any bundling, and they've said they will consider selling off Honeywell's regional jet engine business, which is an overlap with the GE business. But the commission is indicating that these sort of behavioral undertakings aren't enough. That's the drama.

And as you say, Jack Welch meets with Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner tomorrow. We'll just have to see what happens. One of the suggestions is that the Department of Justice is not terribly disappointed about this, using the EU almost as a stalking horse because the customers can go and talk to the EU privately, which they can't do in the United States. So we know Lufthansa and others have gone and complained about this deal privately. Something may come out of it in that way.

EC Voices Concerns  on GE-Honeywell Merger

BRUSSELS --  General Electric  Co.'s proposed purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. would give the company's plane leasing and aircraft engine businesses an added advantage over competitors,  European           antitrustregulators said Tuesday.

The European Commission listed the agency's concerns about the $49-billion transaction in a 156-page report obtained by Bloomberg News.

General Electric is prepared to sell Honeywell's regional jet engine unit as a concession to win the EC's approval for the purchase, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the situation.

The commission also said General Electric might be able to package products at discount prices, such as GE's jet engines and Honeywell's engine parts and avionics, that rivals wouldn't be able to match, stifling competition.

General Electric President Jeff Immelt said last month that the company may agree not to sell packages of products to customers, a practice known as bundling.
GE Chief Executive Jack Welch, who postponed his retirement to complete the Honeywell purchase, will be in
Brussels to meet with European regulators on Friday.

Company spokeswoman Louise Binns said GE would not "comment on any aspect of its discussions with commission officials."

Competitors such as Rolls-Royce and United Technologies Corp. have voiced concern to regulators that General Electric would have an unfair advantage as a supplier of airplane engines and electronics unless it gives up part of the business or accepts restrictions on its marketing, including not selling products solely as a package.
GE is the world's largest jet engine maker and the largest lessor of aircraft through its GE Capital Aviation
Services unit.
Honeywell sells cockpit electronics and small engines used by planes on the ground, among other parts. The European Commission is the regulatory agency of the 15-nation European Union. It can block or force
changes to company mergers even if the firms are not based in Europe.

GE and Honeywell already have received tentative approval from U.S. and Canadian regulators. GE must present possible proposals to the EC by June 14. European regulators have until July 12 to rule on the acquisition.

On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., rose 27 cents to $49.18, while Honeywell fell 10 cents to $48.84. GE would exchange 1.055 of its shares for each Honeywell share in the takeover.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 6 (Reuters) - General Electric  Co.. Chairman Jack Welch on Wednesday dismissed as speculation reports the firm had offered to sell Honeywell  Inc.'s regional jet engine unit to appease  European regulators' concerns about a planned  merger of the two companies.

On the eve of a trip to Brussels to meet with  European regulators about its acquisition of  Honeywell,  Welch vowed to win approval  for the $43 billion deal.
"I'm leaving for Brussels in the morning to try to fix this Honeywell thing," Welch said during an appearance at
Harvard University.
Asked about media reports that he had made an informal offer to European Union regulators to sell some
Honeywell assets, Welch said simply: "All speculation."

Welch is set to meet with EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti on Friday to try to win approval for the massive combination. The Commission must decide by July 12 whether to approve the deal, require concessions, or reject it outright. The U.S. Justice Department cleared the deal last month after Honeywell agreed to sell its small helicopter engine business.

It is a career capping deal for Welch, who is credited with creating $450 billion in shareholder value during his 20 year tenure of the manufacturing conglomerate.

During a discussion before a graduating class at Harvard Business School, Welch recalled the Friday in October when he learned that one of his rivals was going to bid for Honeywell.
"I had the choice Friday night of going to bed or working the weekend. I was going to retire in five months. I
worked the weekend. And we bid $50 billion for Honeywell Monday morning," Welch said.

London's Financial Times on Wednesday reported the European Commission is set to press GE to split the accounts of its aircraft leasing arm before clearing the purchase of Honeywell. Separately, the Wall Street Journal said GE offered to sell the regional jet engine business. GE and Honeywell each make engines used in regional jets.

European rivals fear the powerhouse combination of GE's world-leading jet making business and aircraft financing arm being bundled with Honeywell's cockpit electronics, landing gear and power unit business.

Competitors include engine firms such as United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney and Rolls Royce and avionics firms Rockwell and Thales .

Welch publicly has said he will leave GE by the end of this year, though some insiders say he has told them he hopes to step down as soon as September if GE's acquisition of Honeywell is completed.
"I'm just trying to clean up the laundry and leave town," Welch said at Harvard.

GENERAL Electric  (GE) has denied claims that it broke  EU conditions for a lucrative aircraft engine venture, as it enters a crucial stage of talks with Union  regulators on its planned 48 billion  euro merger with Honeywell.
The company said there was "no foundation" to the allegations, which it attributes to rival engine-maker Rolls
Royce.
The European Commission's approval of
the Engine Alliance venture between GE and

Pratt & Whitney in September 1999 was restricted to the production of engines for aeroplanes with more than 450 seats.

But insiders at a leading GE-Honeywell competitor told European Voice that the joint venture had breached the terms laid down by the regulation. "Engine Alliance was clearly promoting its engines for aircraft which lie outside that category," said one. "They were marketing these engines without permission."
Reports in specialist title Flight In

ternational have also suggested that the GE offshoot offered engines for smaller planes, including Boeing's planned 767-400 ERX and a new version of the Airbus A330.
GE's engine division reacted angrily to the claims. "We've been hearing this from Rolls Royce," said spokesman
Rick Kennedy. "There's no foundation to it."

Kennedy concedes there were plans to build engines for the new 767 - since suspended by Boeing - but maintains they did not breach any conditions. "If an aircraft manufacturer approaches u

s with a request to provide an engine proposal we're allowed to notify the EC to get permission," he said, adding that a request had been filed for the 767.

The allegations come on the eve of a visit to Brussels by GE's chairman and chief executive Jack Welch to discuss possible remedies to win approval for its merger with Honeywell.

According to reports, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti will urge him at a meeting tomorrow (8 June) to separate GE's aircraft leasing arm, Gecas, as a condition for the g

o-ahead. The Commission is also believed to be keen for Honeywell to sell part of its avionics and regional jet business.

It is concerned that GE can 'bundle' its products to airlines by offering engines at a lower price if customers take Honeywell avionics as part of the package. The Commission says Gecas is also used to influence airlines' purchasing decisions.
Welch, who has a reputation as a boss who can't take no for an answer, is instead said to be offering mainly
'behavioural' remedies - promises t

o avoid certain commercial practices which are deemed anti-competitive in a bid to address the Commission's concerns.

GE's competitors, who have been pressing for structural divestments, warn that any behavioural solution would be unenforceable.

Rolls Royce said it had no no official comment to make on the allegations against GE's joint venture with Pratt & Whitney. "This is purely a matter for the Commission to consider in the light of its decision of September 1999," a spokesman said.
Monti's spokeswom

an, Amelia Torres, could not confirm whether the Engine Alliance was being investigated for non-compliance with the conditions of its approval.

The Commission must decide by 12 July whether to approve the GE-Honeywell deal, reject it, or demand concessions.

GE in late bid to win EU's OK of merger with Honeywell: Will offer to divest target's  short-haul jet engine
business

BRUSSELS - Jack Welch, General Electric  Co. chief executive, flies to Brussels this week in a final bid to win European Union approval  for his US$41-billion U.S.  merger deal with Honeywell  International Inc., bringing with him an offer to divest part of the business.
With a Tuesday deadline for offering concessions approaching, GE has indicated it is prepared to sell
Honeywell's  regional jet engine business to satisfy concerns of EU regulators, according to a source close to the
negotiations.
EU regulators cited regional jet engines as one of their top concerns when they launched a probe of the deal in
March, saying the plan was "likely to significantly reduce the existing degree of competition in this market."

GE and Honeywell are two of the main engine suppliers to makers of increasingly popular regional jets, which carry up to 90 passengers on short-haul flights. Honeywell also supplies components to competing engine makers.

Resolution of the regional jet engine problem would still leave another major concern: the likelihood GE and Honeywell could bundle aircraft engines and avionics and sell them at discounts competitors such as Britain's Rolls Royce PLC and France's Thales SA could not match.
Analysts have said, however, they do not believe that concern would be a deal-breaker.
In return for its approval, the U.S. Justice Department required Honeywell to divest its helicopter engine business. Document finp000020010711dx6700qup

General Electric  has denied talk that it had offered to sell  Honeywell's  regional jet engine unit to appease
European regulators' worries over a planned  merger of the two companies.

Chairman Jack Welch said that he was going to Brussels to meet with  European regulators about its US$43 billion acquisition of  Honeywell.

He said media reports that he had made an informal offer to European Union regulators to sell some Honeywell assets were "all speculation".

The US Justice Department cleared the deal last month after Honeywell agreed to sell its small helicopter engine business.

London's Financial Times on Wednesday reported the European Commission is set to press GE to split the accounts of its aircraft leasing arm before clearing the purchase of Honeywell.
Separately, the Wall Street Journal said GE offered to sell the regional jet engine business. GE and Honeywell each make engines used in regional jets.
European rivals fear the powerhouse combination of GE's world-leading jet making business and aircraft financing arm being bundled with Honeywell's cockpit electronics, landing gear and power unit business.

GE Prepared to Sell Honeywell Unit --- Firm May Relinquish Regional Jet-Engine Arm for European          
Merger Approval --- EU Regulators Remained Concerned  About Company's Finance and Leasing Division

In a change of strategy, General Electric  Co. is prepared to sell Honeywell  International Inc.'s regional
jet-engine business to overcome European antitrust opposition to GE's $42.6 billion bid for  Honeywell,  said a
person close to the deliberations.

The proposal, floated in a meeting with European Commission antitrustregulators, signals that  GE has decided to give in to at least some of the EC's complaints about the deal and is ready to discuss selling one or more business units.
While such an offer moves toward settling European antitrust objections, there are other potential problems that
GE may be required to address. The biggest is the vast market power of GE Capital's aviation-services business
-- the company's aircraft financing and leasing arm -- detailed in a confidential 156-page statement prepared by
commission antitrust investigators for the companies.

The statement broadly condemns the proposed deal, finding that it would create a dominant global power in aircraft engines and aerospace electronics. The unexpectedly harsh appraisal makes it clear that the relatively narrow remedy that won antitrust approval for the deal in the U.S. last month won't go far enough in Europe.

In the statement, European investigators found that a combined GE-Honeywell would dominate the market for large regional jet engines. In the U.S., Justice Department officials defined this market more broadly, and didn't require a divestiture. The department ultimately required only the sale of Honeywell's helicopter-engine business, which is relatively small.
In Europe, officials focused on GE's domination of large commercial aircraft-engine sales, which would dwarf
United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney unit and Rolls-Royce PLC. Investigators found that GE exerts
market power through the GE Capital unit, the world's largest financer of aircraft purchases. Investigators found a
potent "bias" toward buying aircraft fitted only with GE engines, raising concerns that this bias could now be
transferred to Honeywell to drive sales of its cockpit electronics, landing gear, power units and other products.

GE Capital is "encouraged to protect and promote all GE products," the investigators said. They found close cooperation between GE's financing unit and Boeing Co., fueled sales of GE engines over those of Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce. GE Capital also is "used by GE to influence the outcome of airlines' airframe purchasing decisions and act as a promoter of GE-powered airframes, to the detriment of GE engine competitors and eventually results, through the use of its disproportionate power, in excluding competing engine sales."

The statement also lists several regional-jet engine purchases allegedly swayed by GE Capital. It found that a combined GE-Honeywell would have a near-monopoly on engines for large regional jets, which carry as many as
90 passengers on short-haul flights.
Four companies make regional jets: Canada's Bombardier Inc.; Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica, or Embraer,
of Brazil; U.S.-based Fairchild Dornier Corp.; and BAE Systems PLC of Britain. GE supplies jet engines to the first
three, the commission said, while Honeywell makes engines for BAE's Avro jets.

GE has previously argued that the European Commission defines this market too narrowly, though its offer to shed the Honeywell line suggests it is ready to abandon this argument.

Page 33 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Honeywell, based in Morristown, New Jersey, had no comment. It is unclear whether GE's latest offer will be enough to close the deal. GE executives have privately stressed that they won't agree to any divestitures involving GE Capital or certain core avionics businesses.

However, lawyers close to the case say GE may be asked to accept far-reaching restrictions on its GE Capital unit to limit bias toward GE engines or Honeywell avionics. GE's chairman and CEO, John F. Welch Jr., is scheduled to arrive Friday in Brussels for a final push to gain approval for his career-capping acquisition.

The EC also found that because of the breadth and vertical integration of GE's many businesses, the Fairfield, Connecticut, conglomerate "appears to have access to sensitive business information of third parties that are or may become customers or business partners of GE, and, at the same time, its competitors."

GE aims to appease Brussels on merger - General Electric.

GENERAL ELECTRIC, the US engineering group, is tomorrow expected to make an eleventh-hour offer to the
European Union to save its #31 billion acquisition of  Honeywell  International.

It is thought that Jack Welch, chief executive of  GE, will fly to Europe to offer Brussels the sale of  Honeywell's regional jet engine business. The EU, which can block the deal if competition officials believe it will create a monopoly, has said that competition in the jet engine market is its biggest concern over a  GE-Honeywell           merger.

GE and Honeywell are the two main engine suppliers for regional jets, which carry up to 90 passengers. The EU's decision on the GE-Honeywell deal is expected on July 12.
GE has already been forced to sell Honeywell's helicopter engine business to gain regulatory clearance from the
US Justice Department.

A planned face-to-face meeting between  General Electric  Co. chief executive Jack Welch and the  European Union's antitrust chief was postponed today in a sign of possible trouble for  GE's $41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International.

"A Friday meeting that had been planned between Mr. Welch and  Commissioner (Mario) Monti has been deferred,"  GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said, declining to elaborate.

She said the GE-Honeywell team, led by GE vice chairman Dennis Dammerman, "is in continuous meetings with the merger task force as they exchange views and work to narrow the issues."

Welch flew in to Brussels early today to try to persuade EU regulators to drop their objections to the deal. Binns declined to comment on whether he would stay for a possible later meeting or return to the United States.

A source close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, played down the significance of the delay, saying it was "essentially just a timing issue."
"We weren't at an appropriate point," the source said.

But the postponement adds to the pressure on GE and Honeywell, who face a Tuesday deadline for making their final offer of concessions. The EU's decision is due one month later, on July 12.

The two men last met in late February, when Welch was still hoping to win easy clearance and have the deal wrapped up by April.

Instead, the EU Commission launched an in-depth probe, citing concerns about the deal's potential to reduce competition in areas such as regional-jet engines, where Evendale-based GE Aircraft Engines and Honeywell dominate the market.

EU/COMPETITION - GENERAL ELECTRIC WILL MAKE CONCESSION TO MERGE WITH HONEYWELL.

Brussels, 07/06/2001 (Agence  Europe) - After an informal meeting held at the end of May between the  European competition authorities and the head of General Electric  (GE), the American conglomerate proposed to sell off the regional transport aircraft engine branch of Honeywell  International in order to end the reservations of the European Commission concerning its planned merger with the latter. In fact, the  Commission opened a
second investigative phase over this operation, fearing that the merger would lead to a dominant position in the markets for aircraft engines and aeronautical electronics (see EUROPE of 3 March, p.10). It should rule next 12
July, while the American authorities have already given their assent. Despite this concession, the  European authorities could nevertheless block the plan, due to fears with regards to Gecas, the aircraft rental subsidiary of GE.

It could in fact grants discounts to airline renting the Gecas planes if they use avionics equipment from Honeywell. This Friday, Jack Welsh, GE President, should meet Commissioner Monti in order to discuss possible solution to the problems raised and submit, according to the Financial Times, several proposals.

RON INSANA, co-anchor: Let's take a closer look now at what this snag could mean for the  GE-Honeywell merger. And joining us is The Wall Street Journal's foreign editor, John Bussey. And, John, what have European regulators proposed? What do they want from  GE?

Mr. JOHN BUSSEY (The Wall Street Journal): Yeah. Well, they've been slowly but surely kind of whittling away at this deal. They want a smaller merged company. GE and Honeywell, in their mind, would just be this 800-pound gorilla that would bundle all of its products together and would just crush the competition. So slowly, but surely,
it's been putting pressure on GE. And GE's been responding by saying, `Well, look, first what we'll do is we'll divest ourselves of some of Honeywell's avionics products. Then some time went by. The EU put more pressure on GE. Then it said, `Well, gee, what if we sell off Honeywell's regional jet engine business?' Now what the EU is saying is, `No, you know, that's just not enough. What we want you to do is we want you to divest--somehow divest--they're a little bit oblique about that--this GE Capital, the aircraft services and leasing operation, which is one of the world's biggest buyers of commercial jets.

INSANA: John, what's the make-or-break here? Do you think the deal gets done, given what Europe is now demanding?
Mr. BUSSEY: Yeah, well, Jack Welch has put himself behind this deal. I mean, this is why, after all, he decided
not to retire. I mean, he wanted to see this deal through. He was stood up today by Mario Monti, who canceled his
meeting with Jack Welch. Mario Monti is the EU competition commissioner, who just felt that enough progress
had not been made in concessions by GE. There is a lot of momentum behind this deal. And there's a lot of
creative thinking that's going to go into perhaps somehow separating the aircraft services business from the main
core business. And that might be through some Chinese wall mechanism...
INSANA: All right.
Mr. BUSSEY: ...that is amenable to the European Union. INSANA: All right. John, thanks very much.
Mr. BUSSEY: You bet.
INSANA: John Bussey of The Wall Street Journal.

Coming up, the NBA steps into the CEO Spotlight. Before the Lakers and the Sixers tip off game two tonight, we'll talk to the man behind the scenes in charge of the action, Commissioner David Stern.

"As the staff exchanges views and narrow the issues a Friday meeting between Mr. Welch and Commissioner
Monti has been deferred for now," she said, speaking from United States by telephone.

The European Commission has raised a series of objections to the proposed $43 billion purchase, saying it might hurt competition for large jet engines and avionics in violation of the law. The two sides are negotiating against a June 14th deadline for proposed accomodations to solve the problem.

European Meeting on GE Merger Aborted  Antitrust: Postponement may signal trouble  for the company's

BRUSSELS -- A planned meeting between  General Electric  Co. Chief Executive Jack Welch and the  European Union's antitrust chief was postponed Friday, a sign of possible trouble for  GE's $41-billion purchase of Honeywell  International.

"A Friday meeting that had been planned between Mr. Welch and  Commissioner [Mario] Monti has been deferred,"  GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said, declining to elaborate.

The GE-Honeywell team, led by GE Vice Chairman Dennis Dammerman, "is in continuous meetings with the merger task force as they exchange views and work to narrow the issues," Binns said.

Welch flew to Brussels early Friday to try to persuade EU regulators to drop their objections to the deal. Binns declined to comment on whether he would stay for a possible later meeting or return to the United States.
EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres declined to comment.
Sources close to GE, speaking on condition of anonymity, however, said the meeting has been rescheduled for
Wednesday.

A source close to the negotiations, also speaking on condition of anonymity, played down the significance of the delay, saying it was "essentially just a timing issue."

But the postponement adds to the pressure on GE and Honeywell, which face a Thursday deadline for making their final offer of concessions. The EU's decision is due July 12.
Asked whether the deadline could be extended, Torres said only that the commission was obligated to follow a
"strict legal timetable."
An EU decision to block the deal could spark a transatlantic trade war, as nearly happened in 1997 when the EU
raised major objections to Boeing's proposed merger with McDonnell Douglas.

In trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, shares of Honeywell dropped $2.24, or 4.6%, to $46.51, while GE fell 77 cents, or 1.57%, to $48.14.

Monti and Welch last met in late February, when Welch was still hoping to win easy clearance and have the deal wrapped up by April.

Instead, the EU Commission launched an in-depth probe, citing concerns about the deal's potential to reduce competition in areas such as regional-jet engines, a market that GE and Honeywell dominate.

Sources said this week that GE was prepared to offer to sell Honeywell's regional jet-engine business to satisfy those "direct overlap" concerns.

But analysts say GE also will have to satisfy EU worries about the effect on competition of "bundling" GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services.

The Justice Department approved the deal May 2 with conditions that require Honeywell to divest its helicopter engine business and authorize new third-party maintenance and repair service for some of its aircraft engines.

In Europe, GE has argued that its aircraft financing and leasing arm is a separate business. Analysts say GE could agree to modify the financing unit's accounting structure to increase transparency and demonstrate it's not subsidizing loss-making enterprises to gain market share, but would balk at any demands to divest what it considers a core business.

Mr. Welch is in Brussels with a team of lawyers representing G.E. and Honeywell  International to negotiate regulatory approval  of their $41 billion merger. G.E. has until the middle of next week to deal with European regulators' objections to the deal. Unless G.E. abandons the deal, a final ruling will be made at the weekly meeting of European commissioners
on July 4 or July 11. Paul Meller (NYT)

GE AND EUROPEAN OFFICIALS DEFER MEETING HONEYWELL MERGER MAY BE IN TROUBLE

A planned face-to-face meeting between  General Electric  Co. chief executive Jack Welch and the  European Union's antitrust chief was postponed Friday in a sign of possible trouble for  GE's $41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International.

"A Friday meeting that had been planned between Mr. Welch and  Commissioner Mario Monti has been deferred," said  GE spokeswoman Louise Binns, declining to elaborate.

She said the GE-Honeywell team, led by GE vice chairman Dennis Dammerman, "is in continuous meetings with merger task force as they exchange views and work to narrow the issues."

Welch flew to Brussels early Friday to try to persuade EU regulators to drop their objections to the deal. Binns declined to say whether he would stay for a possible later meeting or return to the United States.
EU Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres declined to comment.
Sources close to GE, however, said on condition of anonymity that the meeting has been rescheduled for
Wednesday.
One source, also speaking on condition of anonymity, played down the significance of the delay, calling it
"essentially just a timing issue."

But the postponement adds to the pressure on GE and Honeywell, which face a Thursday deadline for making their final offer of concessions.
The EU's decision is due one month later, on July 12.
Asked whether the deadline could be extended, Torres said only that the commission was obligated to follow a
"strict legal timetable."

To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law, just as European companies must abide by U.S. law to do business in America. An EU decision to block the deal could also spark a trans- Atlantic trade war, as nearly happened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

In trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, GE shares closed down 77 cents, at $48.14. Honeywell shares lost $2.24, falling to $46.51.

Monti and Welch last met in late February, when Welch was still hoping to win easy clearance and have the deal wrapped up by April.

Instead, the EU Commission launched an in-depth probe, citing concerns about the deal's potential to reduce competition in areas such as regional-jet engines, where GE and Honeywell dominate the market.

EU Demand Threatens GE-Honeywell

BRUSSELS, June 8 -- In a serious sign of trouble for what would be the world's biggest industrial  merger, European Union antitrust officials are demanding that  General Electric  Co. spin off its highly profitable aircraft leasing arm before they will grant  approval  to GE's planned $45 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc.
While sources close to the talks say the fate of the merger is still uncertain, it is clear that recent negotiations with
EU authorities have taken a sharp turn for the worse for GE and Honeywell.

Even though the U.S. Justice Department gave its consent on condition that Honeywell divest its helicopter engine business, the EU is seeking to impose conditions that are considered so severe they might compel GE to walk away from the merger.

A rejection of the GE-Honeywell deal would mark the first time European antitrust authorities vetoed a merger by two American companies that was approved by the Justice Department.

Officials postponed until Wednesday a final round of talks that had been scheduled for today between GE Chairman Jack Welch and the EU's antitrust commissioner, Mario Monti, when it became clear that the two sides were still too far apart to reach a compromise.

EU officials argue that if the merger goes through, GE's Capital Aviation Services, the aircraft financing and leasing arm, would gain enough clout to compel airlines and aircraft makers to choose GE engines over competing models offered by Rolls Royce and Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp., according to sources close to the talks.

GE-Honeywell would have a dominant position in Europe's aviation industry, giving it the potential to eliminate rivals and raise prices, EU officials worry. In a 140-page brief outlining their objections, EU antitrust officials said they were particularly concerned about GE's ability to "bundle" products so customers would have little choice but to accept package deals involving GE engines, Honeywell avionics and GE Capital's financing.
In closed hearings last week, participants said GE executives appeared shocked by the extent to which the EU
had embraced the views of rival companies.

GE reluctantly proposed to sell Honeywell's regional jet engine business this week to appease concerns that the two companies would acquire a near-monopoly on engines for short-haul planes that carry up to 100 passengers. It marked the first time during the negotiations that GE had offered to sacrifice part of Honeywell's business.

But sources close to the talks say any divestiture of GE Capital Aviation Services, which is regarded as a crown jewel that rakes in huge profits, would probably be considered a deal-breaker.
"Jack Welch may want to end his career with a flourish, but it's hard to believe he would ram through a deal with
Honeywell at the price of losing GECAS," said a person close to the negotiations.

GE has until Thursday to propose remedies to resolve EU antitrust concerns. The EU's executive commission will pass judgment no later than July 12.

The most plausible compromise would involve a limited divestiture, or what antitrust lawyers describe as "building a Chinese wall" between the parent company and GE Capital. GE executives have not closed the door on accepting some limits on GE Capital's behavior or giving it semi-independent status.

Before arriving in the Belgian capital Thursday, Welch vowed to an audience at Harvard University that he would focus his energies in his waning days as GE chairman "to try to fix this Honeywell thing."

But he may not have reckoned with the stubborn will of Monti, who has emerged as perhaps Europe's most powerful business regulator in his three years as EU antitrust commissioner. The former Italian economics professor has often told associates that he is determined to make the forces of global capital bow to the interests of the consumer.

Monti has said in several speeches that he considers divestments as the best method of making mergers compatible with competition needs. He says this is much preferable to extracting promises from companies that vow to change their behavior because these remedies are too difficult to enforce.

GE to give up $2bn in assets to satisfy  EU.
By Lucinda Kemeny.

GE, the world's biggest industrial company, will offer to sell more than $2billion ( #1.4billion) in assets in a dramatic bid to secure  European commission approval  for its #28billion  merger with Honeywell,  the industrial group.

Negotiations between Mario  Monti, the EU's commissioner for competition, and Jack Welch, the head of  GE, are scheduled to end this week.

Monti, who has taken a much harder line towards the deal than expected, will meet Welch on Tuesday to hear the company's final proposals. A meeting set for last Friday was postponed because GE decided it needed more time to come up with a solution to the deadlock. Its compromise offer will go much further than expected.

Monti is concerned about the impact the GE-Honeywell deal will have on competitors in the aviation industry where GE is already the world's biggest maker of engines.

It is understood that Welch has already offered to sell the regional-jet engines business to alleviate the commission's anxiety about overlap between the two companies' products.

But this business is relatively small and Monti's officials, who form the merger taskforce responsible for the case, are pushing for a sizeable divestment. They are concerned that the combined business will be able to dominate competitors by bundling products together in cheap packages and through the strength of GE's aircraft-leasing arm, GCAS.
The only way that GE could satisfy the commission's concerns over bundling would be to sell Honeywell's
avionics businesses, which have a combined value of about $4billion. An adviser close to the deal said: "Avionics
disposals will solve the bundling issue, but a partial disposal will not."

Demands that GCAS would also have to be separated from the main business were, however, said to be "no longer under discussion".

GCAS has only ever bought aircraft with GE engines, and the commission believes the potential of the business to dominate aerospace is cause for serious concern. But GE has said publicly that it will not go ahead with the deal if has to divest itself of GCAS.

Both GCAS and bundling were central issues mentioned in the commission's statement of objections, issued last month as part of the investigation into the merger. The statement was followed by hearings at which several companies, including Rockwell and Rolls-Royce, said they had deep reservations about the deal going ahead.

Monti has been under pressure for the past week from American anti-trust officials to take a softer line, but insiders say that it is still hard to know which way he will turn.
Insiders say the final deal will hinge on GE making a series of divestments that will satisfy the concerns of the EU
and will allow other companies to build up their own business through acquiring the assets.

In addition, there would be checks to ensure that GE does not try to force out its competitors and that there is a rapid dispute-settlement mechanism.

GE Faces Thu Deadline To Win EU Honeywell  Deal Approval
By Matthew Newman
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
783 words
11 June 2001

Dow Jones International News
DJI

(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The next few days will be crucial for General Electric  Co. (GE) as it must come up with a convincing package of concessions within this time to win European Union approval  of its $43 billion acquisition of  Honeywell  International Inc. (HON).

Faced with a June 14 deadline,  GE must essentially convince the E.U.  Commission that the proposed sale of its regional jet-engine business and some of its avionics products is enough to prevent the  merger - one of the biggest this year - from damaging  competition in the sector, industry observers say.

At risk is its aircraft financing arm GECAS - one of the world's biggest aircraft buyers and a jewel in GE's crown - which the Commission may insist it sells before approval is granted. Such a requirement could knock the merger deal dead, observers say.

"The Commission is showing that it's being tough and that it's exploring all possibilities of anticompetitive behavior," one analyst, who declined to be named, said. "GE will struggle to keep GECAS, but without some remedies on GECAS, the deal won't be credible."

GE Chief Executive Jack Welch is planning to return to Brussels either Wednesday or Thursday to wrap up the deal. A meeting last Friday between Welch and E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti was postponed because the deal on divestments wasn't "ripe" for official blessing, according to industry sources.

The Commission is scheduled to make a decision July 12. The U.S. and Canada have already conditionally cleared the deal.

During intense talks Friday and over the weekend, GE presented a package of avionics and non-avionics product sales, hoping to quell the E.U. Commission's concerns that the merged aerospace giant's "bundling" of engines and avionics sales along with financing packages would harm competition.

The package was said to include Honeywell's regional jet business where there is a clear overlap in business, as the two companies directly compete with each other, observers say. GE's CF34 engines and Honeywell's AS900 engine both serve planes in the 70- to 90-seat market.

Other products included in the package were said to be Honeywell's air-turbine starter business, marine-gas turbine business and some non-avionics areas, such as auxiliary power units, weather radar and navigation equipment.

A London-based analyst, who asked to remain anonymous, says GE needs to convince the Commission's antitrust authorities that the package of products represents enough revenue to break a combined GE/Honeywell "continuum of products" that would threaten competition in the sector.

The E.U.'s concern is that a combined GE/Honeywell would sell so many aircraft-related products - from engines to navigational equipment - that it would squeeze out other competitors, such as Rolls-Royce PLC (U.RR) and Pratt and Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. (UTX).

"GE has to show that the products are big enough revenue earners and that they have a large part of the market share," the analyst said. "They need to show that the package is a large revenue-producing line and that it's commercially acceptable."


Page 53 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
However, other analysts say the Commission may take a hard line on selling GECAS because it prefers outright divestments rather than a company's commitment to change its business practices, which are difficult to monitor.
Still, there is some precedent for such "behavioral commitments." The Commission approved Boeing Co.'s (BA)
$3.75 billion acquisition of Hughes Electronics Corp.'s satellite manufacturing and components unit without any
conditions. The companies had suggested a number of behavioral commitments to secure approval.

In the past, GE has argued that its financing arm is a separate business, but the Commission is concerned that GECAS will steer customers to GE engines, Honeywell avionics and service agreements as part of bigger package deals.

To allay those concerns, GE could agree to have separate accounts for GECAS and its other businesses. The company would also have to ensure that the manager at GECAS involved in airline deals would have nothing to do with the rest of the conglomerate.

Another possibility is that GE could agree to spin off GECAS to shareholders, but analysts said such a scenario would be too radical for GE.

"For GE, this isn't a realistic assumption," said a Brussels-based competition lawyer. "But the fact that they are considering it, shows that there's a compromise on the table."

Newscast:  Honeywell-GE  deal still in the hands of European regulators
645 words
11 June 2001
CNBC: Business Center
BCTR
English

RON INSANA, co-anchor: The clock is ticking on the proposed $43 billion-dollar  GE-Honeywell merger. GE has just days to try to satisfy  European regulators, who, according to The Wall Street Journal, are pushing the company to get rid of a highly profitable part of its business. Mike Huckman has the latest on those who are discussing the deal.
MIKE HUCKMAN reporting:

European regulator concerns about the aircraft business could keep the GE-Honeywell deal from ever getting off the ground.

Mr. KENT NEWCOMB (A. G. Edwards): We clearly think GE is going to have to give up something to get this deal done.

HUCKMAN: THE EU commission reportedly thinks the proposed new firm would sell so many airplane parts and services that aircraft engine companies like Rolls Royce and United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney couldn't compete, and tens of thousands of European jobs could be lost. But analysts say what that view fails to take into account is the deal's potential benefit to airlines.

Mr. NEWCOMB: Well, I mean, if you can get a--a broader range of products and services at a better price and you've got a much stronger supplier, you know, as a customer that's--that's generally viewed as good thing.

Mr. NICK HEYMANN (Prudential): Every airline, you know, has endorsed this as really good, because it's going to help them become more efficient.

HUCKMAN: The EU reportedly wants GE to sell its aircraft financing business, which is a unit of GE Capital. Heymann estimates GE Capital accounts for 40 percent of the company's earnings, and the aircraft leasing unit makes up five to seven percent of that number. Newcomb says it's too valuable.

Mr. NEWCOMB: GE has--has been public in saying that it will not, you know, give up the--the crown jewels of the combined company to make it happen.

HUCKMAN: But it is willing to give up other parts of the business. GE's already agreed to sell Honeywell's military helicopter engine unit to get the US Justice Department to OK the deal, but the European commission is not as easily satisfied.
Mr. HEYMANN: The process in Europe is a good one. It's a very, very thorough one.

HUCKMAN: A process that could lead to a compromise, which reportedly ranges from GE selling Honeywell's regional jet engine unit to setting up separate management and accounting for its aircraft leasing business.

Mr. NEWCOMB: They've obviously put some things on the table. We'll just have to--to see how they hammer it out at the end of the day.

HUCKMAN: And GE has until the end of the day on Thursday to submit its antitrust concessions. CEO Jack Welch is expected to go to Brussels midweek to help iron out the details. The European commission then has a deadline of July 12th to make a decision on this deal.
Ron, back to you.
INSANA: Mike, how confident is The Street the de--deal will get done?

HUCKMAN: Well, Heymann is somewhat skeptical about these news reports, and so he thinks that this deal will still get done with relatively few and small divestitures on the part of GE. But Newcomb, on the other hand, puts

Page 55 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
more stock in these stories. He once said there was a 90 percent chance of the deal getting down. He has now downgraded that to a 60 percent to 70 percent chance.
INSANA: All right. Thank you, Mike.
Checking on how the merger partners fared on Wall Street today, among the Dow 30, GE lost 72 cents, and
Honeywell slipped a buck and a quarter to $45.26

TED DAVID, co-anchor: Well, our big story tonight: Crunch time in Brussels, where  General Electric  and Honeywell  are pressing the case for their  merger with European regulators. Scott Cohn is here now with the latest.
Scott.
SCOTT COHN reporting:

And Ted, GE and Honeywell basically have until this Thursday to lay their cards on the table. That's when they have to tell Europeans what concessions they're willing to make to get their deal approved. Between now and then, intense negotiations are continuing. The sticking point: This deal hits the Europeans in a very sensitive place, the air.

General Electric engines on the wings, Honeywell instruments in the cockpit, the whole plane leased to the airline by a division of GE Capital. No question, a combined GE-Honeywell would be an aerospace powerhouse; maybe too powerful for regulators in Europe, home of the Airbus consortium, where aviation is a matter of regional pride. Economist and former Justice Department antitrust official Lawrence White says that pride may well enter into the equation.

Mr. LAWRENCE WHITE (New York University): At least the view from this side of the Atlantic is: In Europe there are sensitive political issues, issues of, you know, a company being a--an important national resource,
a--sometimes even a more protectionist view that encroaches on the antitrust analysis.

COHN: The Europeans have already publicly raised concerns that the deal could hurt competition, that GE's financing arm would be able to pressure customers to order planes with GE engines or Honeywell avionics, hurting European manufacturers like Rolls-Royce. Among the remedies, the Europeans have reportedly suggested that GE sell off its aircraft financing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, which financed some $4 billion worth of aircraft last year. Analysts think that could be a deal-breaker.

Mr. KENT NEWCOMB (A.G. Edwards): They're not going to--to do things that detract from their long-term competitiveness, that detract from their earnings stream and--and, by all accounts, you know, GE aircraft leasing is--is a very critical part of GE Capital and a very profitable business.

COHN: So a team of GE and Honeywell executives and attorneys, led by GE Capital chairman Dennis Dammerman, is in place at EU headquarters in Brussels. Their challenge: find a compromise, perhaps selling off more Honeywell businesses or internal controls to limit GE Capital's leverage for its airline customers.

The question facing the GE team and the cloud that's developed over GE and Honeywell's stock is this: At what point is GE better off walking away, and would it after so much invested in trying to make a deal work? GE chairman Jack Welch and the EU's competition commissioner were supposed to meet last week; that meeting abruptly called off. The hope at GE is that that meeting will be back on--back on any day now, Ted. There is not much time left.
DAVID: Well, is the deadline coming up? July--early July, right? COHN: The deadline for the EU to make its decision...
DAVID: Yeah.
COHN: ...is July, but they have to--GE and Honeywell have to have their concession list in place by Thursday. DAVID: Interesting. OK. Thanks, Scott Cohn, with the very latest.

GE's Honeywell  Bid Hits Snag with Europe's  Antitrust Enforcers
339 words
12 June 2001
06:02
Dow Jones Business News
DJON
English
(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
BRUSSELS -- General Electric  Co.'s planned acquisition of Honeywell  International Inc. hit its most serious obstacle to date as Europe's antitrust enforcers pressed GE to sell more than half of  Honeywell's  entire aerospace division -- the very business that drew  GE to seek to acquire  Honeywell  in the first place -- people familiar with the situation told Tuesday's Wall Street Journal.

While the parties could still broker a compromise, the newest demand from the  European Commission's Merger Task Force targets the core of  Honeywell's  lucrative aerospace business, which accounts for about $10 billion of the company's total annual sales of $25 billion.

A person close to GE (GE) said the commission's Merger Task Force is asking for divestitures totaling $6 billion in annual revenue and including some of Honeywell's (HON) most prized products, such as ground-proximity
warning systems, airborne collision-avoidance devices and communication and navigation equipment. A detailed economic analysis prepared by European regulators contends that Honeywell already has a commanding presence in a number of these segments, and argues that in some areas none of its existing rivals would be able to compete effectively against the research, production and marketing clout of the proposed GE-Honeywell combination. "They are looking for a megabucket full of avionics and nonavionics," said the person, who is familiar with GE's strategy. "At the moment the parties are a long way apart."

If the deal is blocked or major avionics divestitures take place, ironically one of the biggest beneficiaries would be a U.S. company, Rockwell International Corp.'s Collins unit, which is Honeywell's strongest rival in many of the disputed markets. While more than half of Honeywell's sales are in the aftermarket and services segments, so far the commission has given the most scrutiny to those operations that manufacture and sell equipment for newly assembled jets, industry officials said.

STOCKHOLM, June 11 -- The General Electric  Company's $45 billion takeover of Honeywell  International Inc. has a ''reasonable chance'' of winning European approval,  the head of the European Commission's antitrust department said today.

Regulators have no ''definite view'' of how to curb G.E.'s plane-leasing unit, the biggest buyer of jets, Alexander Schaub, the  European official, said in an interview. The  commission is concerned that the leasing business would give G.E. an unfair advantage by enabling it to dominate the production of jet engines and airplane electronics.

''We have to wait to see what they are proposing and then we must make up our minds,'' said Mr. Schaub, who is the top aide of Mario Monti, the European competition commissioner.

Reports have said that the commission may force G.E. to sell the unit. G.E. faces a deadline on Thursday to propose ways of scaling back its business, with a European ruling due by July 12.

Mr. Schaub's comments prompted the gap between the share prices of G.E. and Honeywell to narrow, suggesting that traders believe the merger is moving closer to approval. G.E. closed at $47.45, down 69 cents, while Honeywell closed at $45.25, down $1.26.

G.E. is the biggest jet-engine maker and the largest lessor of aircraft. Honeywell is the biggest maker of auxiliary power units that are used to power planes on the ground. The commission said the takeover would impede competition in aircraft engines and avionics.
But European regulators are unlikely to force G.E. to sell the plane-leasing unit, analysts said.

''I still think you're going to come out of here with behavioral types of restrictions,'' said Tom Mahowald, an analyst at American Express Financial Advisors.

The commission, which is the regulatory agency of the 15-nation European Union, expressed concern about markets for engines for regional and corporate jets, avionics and nonavionics products, as well as small marine gas turbines.

Once the companies submit concessions, the commission will circulate a ''nonconfidential'' version to competitors for comment. It will also draft a recommendation to take to an advisory committee of representatives of national antitrust bodies.

Representatives for G.E. and Honeywell declined to comment on the negotiations, though they said the companies were continuing to work with the commission.
The deal has already been cleared by the United States Department of Justice. Document nytf000020010712dx6c00wsd

Analysis: GE-Honeywell  possible merger

SUE HERERA, co-anchor: And one Dow component that was holding down the Dow today was  Honeywell,  with European regulators keeping its merger with General Electric  in a holding pattern. Although there is still confidence that the merger will ultimately be approved,  some investors fear GE will have to sell half of Honeywell's  aerospace division. That's the unit that attracted  GE to Honeywell  in the first place.
Shares of  GE pushed out of negative territory and posted a sizeable gain today by the end of the session, up
$1.52 to $48.92.
Honeywell, though, went down early, and it stayed down, down a buck 63 to $43.62.
Joining us to talk more about what's going on with the GE-Honeywell deal is The Wall Street Journal's John
Bussey and our Bob Pisani, who covers all the floor action at the New York Stock Exchange today.
Gentlemen, nice to have you here tonight.

John, let me start with you. How much of this is posturing by the European Union and the European countries that have to do with this deal, and how much of it i--is real, do you think at this point?

Mr. JOHN BUSSEY (The Wall Street Journal): Well, some of it, no doubt, is posturing on both sides. They want to get the best deal possible, so they go to the negotiating te--table demanding more than the other is willing to give. That said, we're getting awfully close to the deadlines here, and you would think that at this point, you'd begin to see the shape of an agreement coming through, and we don't see one yet. Now there's plenty of time left for negotiating.

Phillip Shiskin, our reporter on the case in Brussels--I just talked with him couple minutes ago, and he said there's no news so far today out of the negotiations. But down the road, Sue, there's a--kind of a bigger issue here for a lot of US companies. They're watching this, and they're saying to themselves, `Gee whiz, this has gotten really complex. Any merger that I'm planning, I'm going to have to think about this,' because there seem to be two different theories of--of--of mergers. One in the US, which looks more immediately at how the merger will affect
prices and consumers, and then the European way, which looks way down the road and says, what's this going to do to the market and to the market structure, which is a harder thing to fathom for US companies.

HERERA: Now, Bob, speaking of the market--at least the market here in the US, it was really kind of the focus of traders' attentions at the end of the day, but not a lot of people wanted to talk about it as I understand.
BIB PISANI reporting:

No, you--it was tough. People talked to me sort of quietly and not for attribution, but not a lot of people wanted to be quoted directly on it. I--w--the market was clearly worried about the GE-Honeywell deal due to the developments you heard from John, Sue. And the key point was that we saw the spread widening dramatically overnight. The spread is the difference between what General Electric was offering for Honeywell minus what Honeywell is being valued at in the market today. So the spread, that difference widened dramatically overnight. That was a sign that at least some players thought that this deal may have problems going ahead.

So the question is: What was the problem right now? And there were two groups that traders were telling me about. One was arbitrage players, who are long Honeywell and they are short General Electric. This is a very traditional arbitrage position to take. There was a lot of speculation that some of these arbitrage players were now unwinding those positions out of concern that the deal may not, in fact, occur.

The other group that they were talking about, Sue, was mutual funds. A lot of mutual funds own Honeywell as a proxy for General Electric as a sort of cheap way of owning general electric. There is also co--some concern about out--about there--about whether or not those mutual funds, some of them may have been concerned, and

Page 62 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
they also went out and bought General Electric, because they needed to, basically, because they have to have some weighting in General Electric.

The final point I'll make, Sue, here is that the Street--when I called around and talked to traders and arbitrage players, 100 percent of them felt that this deal would go through, and yet, you saw clear evidence that at least some people didn't feel...
HERERA: Are doubting it.
PISANI: ...the deal was going to necessarily make it.
HERERA: Yeah. John Bussey, you get the last word. Broaden it out for us, the trade implications between the US
and Europe. If--are there trade implications if this deal falls apart or not?

Mr. BUSSEY: Well, probably more sort of intuitive on the part of companies if they're going to be willing to cross the Atlantic to--on--on mer--in merger deals, or have to go before the European Union merging with a company that has operations in Europe, like Honeywell and GE does. The good news is that most deals aren't this big. This is huge, and it affects...
PISANI: Yeah.

Mr. BUSSEY: ...a very large market, and that's why the EU is looking at this so closely. The bad news may be that there may be more divergence in the future between the US regulators in a Bush business-friendly administration and in a left-of-center government of Europe that might be as--even more aggressive on these fronts in the future.
HERERA: All right. John Bussey of The Wall Street Journal, Bob Pisani here on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange, gentlemen, thank you.
Mr. BUSSEY: You bet.

Report on Business: The Wall Street Journal
GE deal almost killed by EUHoneywell  acquisition hits antitrust wall

BRUSSELS -- General Electric  Co.'s planned acquisition of Honeywell  International Inc. came close to the brink of collapse yesterday, as Europe's antitrust enforcers pressed GE to sell more than half of  Honeywell's  entire aerospace division -- the very business that drew  GE to seek to acquire  Honeywell  in the first place -- say people familiar with the situation.

While the parties could still broker a compromise, the newest demand from the  European Commission's Merger Task Force targets the core of  Honeywell's  lucrative aerospace business, which accounts for about $10-billion (U.S.) of the company's total annual sales of $25-billion.

A person close to GE said the Commission's Merger Task Force is asking for divestitures totalling $6-billion in annual revenue and including some of Honeywell's most prized products, such as ground-proximity warning systems, collision-avoidance devices, corporate jet engines and units making communication and navigation equipment. "They are looking for a megabucket full of avionics and non-avionics," said the person, who is familiar with GE's strategy. "At the moment the parties are a long way apart."
On Friday, GE's negotiators offered to sell various Honeywell divisions with combined annual sales of
$1.55-billion, including units making regional jet engines, engine starters, weather radars and other businesses.

But the Commission is trying to force GE to substantially increase that offer. One person familiar with the Commission's thinking said the Merger Task Force wanted GE to raise its Friday proposal three to four times. This would increase the total divestment figure to between $4.65-billion and $6.2-billion in annual sales. "Fundamentally, this puts the deal in jeopardy," said the person familiar with GE's strategy.
Spokeswomen for GE and the Commission separately declined to comment on the negotiations.

Until the past day or two, Honeywell and GE officials were confident that the Commission wouldn't seek divestitures that would undercut the aerospace synergies the two companies believe the merger would provide, according to people familiar with the matter.

From the beginning, GE has wanted to create a seamless range of aerospace products combining GE jet engines with Honeywell's avionics equipment. But the Commission is concerned that such bundling would sideline GE's competitors without a similar range of products to offer. It has therefore sought to make GE divest a large part of Honeywell's business to make such bundling impossible. Some of the Honeywell units that the Merger Task
Force wants GE to sell are crucial to Honeywell's overall business.

Honeywell, for instance, is the pre-eminent supplier of the newest generation of ground-proximity warning systems (called enhanced ground-prox), designed to warn pilots of surrounding terrain and give them a warning to climb in order to avoid a crash. Honeywell hopes to leverage that position to sell related devices to help pilots navigate and orient themselves when manoeuvring close to the ground. (In its analysis of the GE-Honeywell merger, prepared last month, the Commission indicated that Honeywell's major rivals, including Paris-based Thales SA, are weak in this market.)

The latest setback for GE comes just days after the Commission floated another suggestion -- to spin off the GE Capital Aviation Services unit -- but this was unacceptable to the company. Still, a person familiar with the

Commission's thinking said Gecas, which is GE's aircraft leasing and financing arm, remains one of the problems to be addressed.

GE's negotiators are heading back for more talks with the Commission today in the hope of finding a compromise. The company must come up with a package of antitrust concessions by Thursday. The final decision on the case will be handed down by July 12.

BUSINESS
GE OFFERS EU MORE MERGER CONCESSIONS PRIMARY ISSUE, HOWEVER, MAY BE FATE OF
AIRCRAFT LEASING UNIT, OBSERVERS SAY
BARBARA NAGY; And MICHAEL REMEZ; Courant Staff Writers

General Electric  Co. has offered more concessions aimed at winning  approval  of its $45 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc., but  GE's aircraft-leasing unit remains the biggest obstacle to  antitrust certification, according to published reports.

It's clear from comments in the  European press that regulators understand concerns raised by  GE's competitors, including United Technologies Corp. and Rolls-Royce PLC, said Mark A. Bobbi, an aerospace and energy consultant in Prospect.

Those companies are worried not so much about GE gaining a monopoly in certain product lines, but about the clout the company would have in the industry if the merger goes through.
They're especially worried that GE Capital Aviation Services, or GECAS -- the world's largest buyer of jet aircraft
-- would use that clout to dictate that planes be outfitted with GE components. That, in effect, could push rivals
such as UTC out of some markets.
European publications said Sunday that GE has proposed selling several aerospace product lines, including
Honeywell's avionics, auxiliary power units, environmental control systems, and engine starters.
Last week, GE said it might also divest itself of part of Honeywell's small-engine unit.

Industry observers played down the significance of those proposals. They suspect that GE is offering to sell only narrow parts of Honeywell's aerospace business, and said the real question is how the GECAS issue will be resolved.
Honeywell's cockpit avionics unit, for example, would complement UTC's Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton
Sundstrand divisions, which make engines and components for medium-size and large jets.
If GE sold that business, UTC could be a buyer.

But analysts said GE would be loath to divest itself of any product line or business that could benefit rivals such as UTC.

"There's no way they're going to sell the high-value-added businesses of Honeywell," a Pratt executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "That's why GE is buying Honeywell."
Bobbi agreed.
"If it's 50-passenger and up, GE wants to control it. GE wants to own it," he said. "That's where the big bucks are." GE has until Thursday to propose "remedies" to European regulators.
Antitrust authorities have until July 12 to accept or reject the deal, possibly with modifications.

European regulators have no "definite view" about how to curb GE's aircraft leasing unit, Alexander Schaub, an official with the European Commission, said in an interview with Bloomberg News.

"We have to wait to see what they are proposing, and then we must make up our minds," said Schaub, the top aide to Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

The Financial Times reported that the commission might force GE to sell the unit, but analysts said restrictions on how GECAS operates are more likely.

Paul Nisbet of JSA Research in Newport, R.I., said this week should provide an indication of how far GE is willing to go to satisfy the concerns of European regulators.
Company Chairman John F. Welch has said he would walk away from the deal if the restrictions are too severe. "Hopefully, we'll have a clue of what Jack Welch offers to do. That is probably going to be as far as he is willing to
go, or pretty close to it," Nisbet said.

He said it appears that the Europeans are trying to get as close as possible to the outer limits of what GE can accept without killing the deal.
Nisbet compared the process to a high-stakes chess match, with each side carefully plotting its every move. "Obviously, [the regulators] are pushing them to the brink to get some significant concessions," Nisbet said. "I
suspect this whole thing will go through, and I suspect they won't get all the concessions they'd like."

Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with SG Cowen & Co., said UTC will have to evaluate the potential for acquisitions after European regulators hand down their decision.
Some purchases may be impossible because of antitrust concerns, he said.

But he said the final ruling on the GE-Honeywell deal will give UTC and other bidders a better idea of how regulators view consolidation.

GE-Honeywell  Deal's Problems  Deepen --- Europe's  Antitrust Enforcers Push for Aerospace  Sale That
Undercuts Synergies
By Philip Shishkin and Andy Pasztor

BRUSSELS -- General Electric  Co.'s planned acquisition of Honeywell  International Inc. hit its most serious obstacle to date as Europe's antitrust enforcers pressed GE to sell more than half of  Honeywell's  entire aerospace division -- the very business that drew  GE to seek to acquire  Honeywell  in the first place -- say people familiar with the situation.

While the parties could still broker a compromise, the newest demand from the  European Commission's Merger Task Force targets the core of  Honeywell's  lucrative aerospace business, which accounts for about $10 billion of the company's total annual sales of $25 billion.

A person close to GE said the commission's Merger Task Force is asking for divestitures totaling $6 billion in annual revenue and including some of Honeywell's most prized products, such as ground-proximity warning systems, airborne collision-avoidance devices and communication and navigation equipment. A detailed economic analysis prepared by European regulators contends that Honeywell already has a commanding presence in a number of these segments, and argues that in some areas none of its existing rivals would be able to compete effectively against the research, production and marketing clout of the proposed GE-Honeywell combination. "They are looking for a megabucket full of avionics and nonavionics," said the person, who is familiar with GE's strategy. "At the moment the parties are a long way apart."

If the deal is blocked or major avionics divestitures take place, ironically one of the biggest beneficiaries would be a U.S. company, Rockwell International Corp.'s Collins unit, which is Honeywell's strongest rival in many of the disputed markets. While more than half of Honeywell's sales are in the aftermarket and services segments, so far the commission has given the most scrutiny to those operations that manufacture and sell equipment for newly assembled jets, industry officials said.

On Friday, GE's negotiators offered to sell various Honeywell divisions with combined annual sales of $1.55 billion, including units making regional jet engines, engine starters, weather radars and other businesses. But the commission is trying to force GE to substantially increase that offer. One person familiar with the commission's thinking said the Merger Task Force wanted GE to raise its Friday proposal three to four times. This would increase the total divestment figure to between $4.65 billion and $6.2 billion in annual sales. "Fundamentally, this puts the deal in jeopardy," said the person familiar with GE's strategy.
Spokeswomen for GE and the commission separately declined to comment on the negotiations.

From the beginning, GE has wanted to create a seamless range of aerospace products combining GE jet engines with Honeywell's cockpit instruments and avionics equipment, and then mesh them with maintenance and
data-collection services. Honeywell officials in the past have stressed the goal of helping airlines do pre-emptive maintenance and identify emerging safety issues. Some of the Honeywell units that the Merger Task Force wants GE to sell are central to that concept, and are considered by GE to be stepping stones to further market penetration.

But the commission is concerned that such bundling would sideline GE's competitors without a similar wide range of products to offer. Honeywell, for instance, is the pre-eminent supplier of the newest generation of
ground-proximity warning systems, designed to alert pilots of surrounding terrain and give them a warning to climb in order to avoid a crash. Honeywell hopes to leverage that position to sell related devices to help pilots navigate and orient themselves when maneuvering close to the ground. (In its analysis of the GE-Honeywell deal,
Page 68 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
prepared last month, the commission indicated that Honeywell's major rivals, including Paris-based Thales SA, are weak in this particular market.)

So far, none of the product lines GE has offered to shed are considered by company or other industry officials to threaten the basic synergies that prompted the original deal. But the avionics businesses now targeted by European regulators are among the fastest growing parts of Honeywell. Selling them not only would be a major economic blow to GE, but the new entity would lose a big chunk of the expertise, engineering talent and product building blocks that initially attracted GE. Moreover, the remaining nonaerospace Honeywell units, ranging from industrial automation equipment to automotive parts, have turned in subpar performances for many quarters. And GE has been widely expected to seek to divest itself of some of them if its proposed acquisition receives the
green light from European officials.

The latest setback for GE comes just days after the commission floated another suggestion -- to spin off GE's aircraft leasing and financing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services unit -- but this was quickly recognized as a "deal breaker" that would most likely prompt GE to walk away.

GE's negotiators are heading back for more talks with the commission today in the hope of finding a compromise. The company must come up with a package of antitrust concessions by Thursday. The final decision on the case will be handed down no later than July 12.

GE's Welch meets EU's Monti ahead of deadline for Honeywell  deal

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  General Electric  Co. chief executive Jack Welch met with Europe's top antitrust regulator Wednesday, a day before a deadline for meeting  EU objections to the dlrs 41 billion merger with Honeywell  International Inc,  EU sources said.
No details about the meeting were disclosed, but it comes amid reports that negotiations have been strained over
EU demands for significant divestitures in  Honeywell's  aerospace division.

A spokeswoman for Competition Commissioner Mario Monti refused comment, and a GE spokeswoman could not be immediately reached.

Welch was to have met with Monti Friday and flew in to Brussels, but the meeting was postponed at the last minute. A source close to the negotiations said then that they weren't "at an appropriate point."

Under EU rules, GE has until midnight Thursday to make its final offer of concessions to meet the regulators' concerns. The EU's decision is due one month later, on July 12.

Monti and Welch last met in late February, just before the EU Commission said it was opening an in-depth probe into the proposed merger.

Monti's office cited concerns about the deal's potential to reduce competition in areas such as regional-jet engines, where GE and Honeywell dominate the market.

Sources said last week that GE was prepared to offer to sell Honeywell's regional-jet engine business to satisfy those "direct overlap" concerns.

But analysts also say GE also will have to satisfy EU worries about the impact on competition of "bundling" GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS).

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the EU has demanded GE sell more than half of Honeywell's lucrative aerospace division, including ground-proximity warning systems, collision-avoidance devices and corporate jet engines.

The total divestitures sought account for dlrs 6 billion, out of Honeywell's total annual sales of dlrs 25 billion, the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources.

The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal May 2 with conditions that require Honeywell to divest its helicopter engine business and authorize new third-party maintenance and repair service for some of its aircraft engines.

Huge rift separate GE, Honeywell  and EU to get merger approval

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International said Thursday the  European Union was asking far too many concessions to get their merger approved,  making it unlikely the dlrs 41 billion linkup will get the backing of the 15-nation bloc.

Welch said in a statement his company "wanted to complete the transaction but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal."
"The Commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point."
"The European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined," he said.

The two companies submitted to the EU's antitrust office a final package of concessions they were willing to make, including dlrs 2.2 billion in divestitures in Honeywell's Aerospace business.

But the statement said the proposed selloffs "are far short of the European Commission's demands which seek billions more than the proposed GE divestitures."

Welch and EU antitrust Commissioner Mario Monti had a telephone conversation early Thursday to discuss their differences.

The undertakings submitted by the two companies would reduce Honeywell's dlrs 25 billion in revenues by 9 percent. The combined GE-Honeywell revenues would decline by about 1.5 percent. But the proposal would have left the dlrs 3 billion of anticipated gains from cooperation largely intact.

Welch met twice with Monti on Wednesday to try to satisfy EU objections to the deal. The deadline for GE to offer concessions is midnight Thursday. A decision is due July 12.

Before the second meeting broke, an EU source said that the "atmosphere is still good" and both sides "are working toward a solution."
The press release of GE shed a different light Thursday.

Monti's office has cited concerns about the deal's potential to reduce competition in areas such as regional-jet engines, where GE and Honeywell dominate the market, as well as the impact on competition of "bundling" GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS).
GECAS is also the world's second-biggest buyer of airplanes, which it then leases to airlines and others.
GE said Thursday that it offered to set up GECAS as a separate "ring-fenced" entity to deal at arms length with
Honeywell.
The EU's antitrust office was expected to react to the news later on Thursday. (rac-cb)

No details about the meetings were officially disclosed, but they come amid reports that negotiations have been strained over EU demands for significant divestitures in  Honeywell's  aerospace division.
A spokeswoman for Competition Commissioner Mario Monti refused comment, and GE spokeswoman Louise
Binns only confirmed that the meetings occurred.

Before the second meeting broke, an EU source said that the "atmosphere is still good" and both sides "are working toward a solution."
"GE is proactive and trying to come up with creative solutions," he said on condition of anonymity.

Welch was to have met with Monti Friday and flew in to Brussels, but the meeting was postponed at the last minute. A source close to the negotiations said then that they weren't "at an appropriate point."

But analysts also say GE also will have to satisfy EU worries about the impact on competition of "bundling" GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS).

At Wednesday's first meeting, GE offered to divest dlrs 2.1 billion worth of its avionics business, but the offer didn't satisfy the Commission, said a person close to the negotiations, also speaking on condition of anonymity.

GE negotiators also proposed introducing management separation between GECAS and the rest of the company, creating separate accounts for GECAS and installing an independent compliance committee that would make
sure that GECAS acts as a semi-independent company within GE, the source said.

The Commission's Merger Task Force had initially pressed GE to spin off GECAS to the company's existing shareholders, but GE negotiators always dismissed this option as unacceptable.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the EU has demanded GE sell more than half of Honeywell's lucrative aerospace division, including ground-proximity warning systems, collision-avoidance devices and corporate jet engines.

GE Struggle  Points to Schism Between EU, U.S. Regulators --- Panel's Demands Imperil  Honeywell           Merger
By staff reporters Brandon Mitchener and Philip Shishkin in Brussels, Anita Raghavan in London and Matt Murray in Pittsburgh

General Electric  Co.'s tough road to European approval  of its bid for  Honeywell  International Inc. could signal a divergence between  European Union and U.S. regulators and make mergers less predictable.

After the European Commission made potentially deal-breaking demands for divestitures of substantial portions of Honeywell's  business, GE's negotiators are working to reach a compromise with the  commission that would save the $41 billion (48.59 billion  euro) deal. The Europeanantitrust authority has less than a month to give its thumbs up or thumbs down.

"There are unmistakable signs of a divergence, and that has to be of real concern," says Alec Burnside, a partner at law firm Linklaters & Alliance in Brussels.

Antitrust lawyers say the commission is less impressed than U.S. regulators with arguments that large-scale mergers will bring economies of scale that benefit consumers through lower prices. Some antitrust lawyers also complain the commission is using legal theories long discarded in the U.S. These differences were largely papered over during the Clinton administration, when the U.S. and much of Europe were headed by center-left governments. But with a conservative Republican in the White House, the differences in antitrust enforcement could become more acute.

"The general expectation is that the new (U.S.) administration is going to be less of an enforcer of mergers at the same time the (commission's) merger task force are hitting their stride and looking at cases more closely," says Mr. Burnside.

Antitrust lawyers are quick to point out that there have been numerous cases in the past where European and U.S. antitrust authorities reached different conclusions about the same deal -- especially in big deals. But whereas those past divergences could generally be explained by different facts -- a different impact in different markets, for example -- the markets and competitors in the GE-Honeywell case are all global, making the current divergence all the more surprising.

"What we've seen in a number of cases is that analysis is the same, the economics are the same, but the point at which intervention would be deemed appropriate is different in the U.S. and the EU," says John Kallaugher, an antitrust lawyer at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in London.

Antitrust practitioners say Brussels's stance stems from the commission's inclination to protect the competitors of the merging companies and to use merger control as a way of investigating the conduct of powerful companies.

As GE and other companies before it have learned, the commission's antitrust enforcers are reluctant to accept promises from merging parties and would rather see clear-cut divestments. On top of this, critics argue, the commission's merger task force has little judicial oversight and is therefore able to take a harder line in relation to some merger cases. The commission itself strongly denies any kind of bias.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, for his part, has suggested that the GE-Honeywell deal isn't necessarily comparable with the bulk of other mergers and acquisitions his office is required to review. "In terms of antitrust analysis, GE-Honeywell is slightly more than a simple case," he told a news conference in May. "Actually, it is a complex case."


Page 85 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The commission's antitrust enforcers are worried that the combined company will be able to undercut its competitors by offering its customers discounted packages of airspace products such as jet engines and cockpit equipment. These competitors, as the theory goes, wouldn't stand a chance of matching the combined company's range of products. In the long term, the commission says, GE may even drive some of its weaker rivals out of business.

For other companies attempting to do big mergers, the lesson should be clear. While the U.S. will examine a merger's immediate impact on prices and consumers, the commission is likely to take a longer view and ponder how the merger will affect both the structure of markets and the companies' competitors, antitrust lawyers say.

The commission also appears to be less receptive to the companies' arguments about the efficiencies of a merger. Some companies argue that a combination of their businesses will deliver benefits to the consumer through reduced prices and streamlined lines of supply. This argument didn't fly in GE-Honeywell's case. Although U.S. antitrust enforcers aren't particularly enthusiastic about efficiency defenses either, they are more likely to accept such arguments, antitrust lawyers say.

Big companies doing deals in the EU may also have their sheer size working against them. One of the biggest problems in GE-Honeywell's case, for instance, is GE's powerful aircraft financing and leasing arm. Although the commission has argued that GE Capital Aviation Services can be used to amplify the negative effects of the Honeywell deal, some observers note that the commission is using the merger to change the structure of GE itself.

Some of the hurdles GE is aiming to scale, lawyers and other observers say, scare other companies that might face similar scrutiny, including having to defend themselves against antitrust theories that are unfamiliar outside of Europe. "If GE can't do its merger with Honeywell, then other chief executives will ask the question whether they can do deals with regulatory complications," says Rick Sapp, head of the European advisory group at Goldman, Sachs International.

A hang-up in the GE-Honeywell deal could make corporations "gun-shy of deals with regulatory problems and require chief executives to engage in more extensive pre-planning of clearance risks," says Mr. Sapp.

But there's also good news for others in the marriage market: What GE and Honeywell are up against is unusual. The GE-Honeywell deal isn't only bigger than most others, but also has the potential to reshape an entire industry
-- in this case the global aerospace industry. Most deals are far less sweeping in scope. And most companies are used to the commission's scrutiny. "The reality is that (the regulatory issue) is part of the landscape and it has been" for several years, said Tom King, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney.

GE Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Welch Jr. has admitted that he underestimated European antitrust concerns.

GE Bid for Honeywell  Hits Serious Obstacle --- EU Regulators Push for Aerospace  Sale, Undercutting
Logic Behind Deal
By Philip Shishkin and Andy Pasztor

BRUSSELS -- General Electric  Co.'s planned acquisition of Honeywell  International Inc. hit its most serious obstacle to date as Europe's antitrust enforcers pressed GE to sell more than half of  Honeywell's  entire aerospace division -- the very business that drew  GE to seek to acquire  Honeywell  in the first place, people familiar with the situation said.

While the parties could still broker a compromise, the newest demand from the  European Commission's Merger Task Force targets the core of  Honeywell's  lucrative aerospace business, which accounts for about $10 billion of the company's total annual sales of $25 billion.

A person close to GE said the Merger Task Force is asking for divestitures totaling $6 billion in annual revenue and including some of Honeywell's most prized products, such as ground-proximity warning systems, airborne collision-avoidance devices and communication and navigation equipment.

A detailed economic analysis prepared by European regulators contends that Honeywell already has a commanding presence in a number of these segments, and argues that in some areas none of its existing rivals would be able to compete effectively against the research, production and marketing clout of the proposed
GE-Honeywell combination. "They are looking for a megabucket full of avionics and nonavionics," said the person, who is familiar with GE's strategy. "At the moment the parties are a long way apart."
Shares of both companies fell Tuesday in New York Stock Exchange trading on news of the latest troubles. GE
was trading at $46.80, down 60 cents, or 1.3%. Honeywell shares were off $2.87, or 6.3%, at $42.38.

If the deal is blocked or major avionics divestitures take place, ironically one of the biggest beneficiaries would be a U.S. company, Rockwell International Corp.'s Collins unit, which is Honeywell's strongest rival in many of the disputed markets.

On Friday, GE's negotiators offered to sell various Honeywell divisions with combined annual sales of $1.55 billion, including units making regional jet engines, engine starters, weather radars and other businesses. But the commission is trying to force GE to substantially increase that offer. One person familiar with the commission's thinking said the Merger Task Force wanted GE to raise its Friday proposal three to four times. This would increase the total divestment figure to between $4.65 billion and $6.2 billion in annual sales. "Fundamentally, this puts the deal in jeopardy," said the person familiar with GE's strategy.
Spokeswomen for GE and the commission declined to comment on the negotiations.

From the beginning, GE has wanted to create a seamless range of aerospace products combining GE jet engines with Honeywell's cockpit instruments and avionics equipment, and then mesh them with maintenance and
data-collection services. Honeywell officials have stressed the goal of helping airlines do pre-emptive
maintenance and identify emerging safety issues. Some of the Honeywell units that the Merger Task Force wants
GE to sell are central to that concept, and are considered by GE to be stepping-stones to further market
penetration.

GE's negotiators were heading back for more talks with the commission Tuesday in the hope of finding a compromise. The company must come up with a package of antitrust concessions by Thursday. The final decision on the case will be handed down by July 12.

RON INSANA, co-anchor: Now those closest to the situation are keeping quiet about the facts, but it appears there are miles to go before  General Electric's  huge deal with  Honeywell  gets official  approval  in Europe. The merger got some intense top-level work today in crucial meetings between CEO Jack Welch and European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. For more on the story now, I'm joined by The Wall Street Journal's John Bussey at the World Financial Center, and our Bob Pisani, reporting tonight from CNBC headquarters in New Jersey.

John, let me start with you. There were wire service reports saying today that Mr. Welch met with Mr.  Monti, and that Mr. Welch told a US government official that the talks did not go well. Do we know anything more this evening?
JOHN BUSSEY reporting

Yeah. Well, they're continuing to negotiate. And who knows? They may be able to still pull this off. But our reporters in Brussels say that, though they met twice today, they are still far apart. GE made a few more concessions in both willingness to sell off some of the avionics of Honeywell and separating its big aircraft leasing company, the management of it, from--with a Chinese wall from the rest of the company, which was something that the--the EU wanted. They actually wanted them to s--spin off that--that entire division. But GE is saying
that--or the players in the--the negotiations are saying that it's still far apart.

The other thing that GE did is call in some air support from Washington. Washington officials in Europe are now speaking out in favor of the deal passing through. They say they're going to take it up with the EU at a EU meeting in Sweden tomorrow, Thursday. And a very top-level antitrust official from the Justice Department has gone over to Brussels to explain why the Justice Department of the US has already approved this deal.
INSANA: Yeah. Bob Pisani, speaking of far apart as the two negotiators are said to be, so is the spread now... BOB PISANI reporting:
Yeah.

INSANA: ...between the deal price and the price of Honeywell shares. Tell us a little bit about what that is suggesting is going on at the moment.

PISANI: It's very simple, Ron. It's a way of looking at how worried the Street is. This was a real emotional roller coaster for investor days--for investors today and particularly for arbitrage players who have a lot vested in this deal.

And one way to look at how worried the Street has been is to look at the spread, and the spread is very simple to understand. It's simply what General Electric is offering to buy Honeywell for, minus what Honeywell is currently being valued for on the Street, the current price of Honeywell at any one moment.

Ideally--and look at this chart as a worry meter. As this line goes up, it signifies that the Street is worried about the deal. The higher the number, the more worried the Street is. The lower the number, the less worried the Street is. This is only two days. This is Tuesday and this is today here.

Now in an ideal situation, the spread in a deal, as the deal gets closer, should drop. It should go to zero on the day the deal actually occurs. But look, the spread has been widening. This is suggesting--And this was yesterday's action. This is suggesting that the Street is very concerned that the deal has a higher probability of not going through. Yet at today, at the open--Here's the open right now--you'll notice the spread dropped...
INSANA: Yeah.

Page 89 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
PISANI: ...and it narrowed, as we like to say. The reason this happened is that there was word out that Mr. Welch was going into his meetings this morning with fresh proposals. That means people were more optimistic the deal may go through.
INSANA: All right.

PISANI: Ron, as we got through the rest of the day, we got those headlines you were talking about, all of a sudden the spread widened again, suggesting once again, the Street was worried. Ron.
INSANA: John, tell us what goes on tonight and tomorrow.

BUSSEY: They negotiate. They try to close the gap. By the end of the day tomorrow, GE, that's the day on which GE has to present its list of concessions, final concessions to the Competition Commission in Brussels. That's the deadline: end of the day. Then the Competition Commission circulates those concessions to all of GE's competitors and asks for comment. Then the Competition Commission makes its decision, perhaps as early as July 4th, but no later than July 12th.
INSANA: All right. Gentlemen, thanks very much. John Bussey and Bob Pisani, I appreciate your insights tonight. Document bctr000020010710dx6d001yy

Interview: Christine Glancey talks about stories  coming  out in tomorrow's edition  of The Wall Street

TED DAVID, co-anchor: All right. Tomorrow morning's Wall Street Journal will have coverage from reporters in Brussels who are following  GE's efforts to win  European approval  of its merger with Honeywell.  Let's find out what else will be in the Thursday edition. Deputy national editor Christine Glancey is at Journal headquarters. As we lumber along here on Last Call, trade tensions between the US and Canada causing higher lumber prices, are they?

Ms. CHRISTINE GLANCEY (The Wall Street Journal): Yes, Ted, lumber prices are up. Just today, the July contract was up over 3 percent. And this is Canadian mills pulling back on production, just as construction crews are getting ready to get to work in the nicer weather down here in the States. And all this is leading up to a US Commerce Department decision due June 26th. It's been a long-running feud, many decades, between US and Canadian mills. And it's just coming to a head again. This is just another chapter in a long-running dispute.
DAVID: Hmm. So if you want to know how a business is doing, maybe you ought to just ask its customers, huh? Ms. GLANCEY: Yeah. Now our Heard on the Street column tomorrow takes a hard look at Intel. And if you
remember last week, Intel got a small pop when the CFO said that demand for their chips in the second half of
this year would be better than the first half. Well, that wasn't based on any new data. It was all historical trends,
and the second half has always been better for Intel. So what our reporters decided to do is look at the users of
chips. And if you remember in the--during the past week, both HP and Dell, big users of Intel chips, said they see
slackening demand for their PCs. And Nokia, as well, uses its--uses Intel's chips in their cell phones, and they
also see slowing demand.
DAVID: All right. Last but not least, you'll pardon me if I do this. Ms. GLANCEY: Go ahead.
DAVID: One industry that's getting clubbed of late is getting creative?

Ms. GLANCEY: Yes, golf carts are getting creative. They're going country. It seems that new construction of golf courses hit its high in 1998 and has slipped a bit. So makers of golf carts, being creative, looked around and they're now selling their machines to ranchers, farmers and even hunters. They're souping them up, painting them green, giving them bigger bumpers, higher tires and charging a bundle for them, and they're--they're going off road, into the woods.
DAVID: And what is this now, 15 manufacturers are vying for a piece of this fast-growing market?
Ms. GLANCEY: Yeah, and they're--they're big manufacturers, too. Ingersoll-Rand has a unit into it, and so does
Textron.

DAVID: Hmm, interesting. Well, we'll be sure to check out that and the rest in The Wall Street Journal tomorrow. And we'll see you tomorrow, as well.
Ms. GLANCEY: Have a good night, Ted.
DAVID: You, too. Thank you, Christine Glancey, deputy national editor of The Wall Street Journal. Document bctr000020010710dx6d001zx

GE, Honeywell  Submit Final Undertakings To EC >GE HON
934 words
14 June 2001
15:01
Dow Jones News Service

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)-  Honeywell  International Inc. (HON) and General Electric  Co. (GE) submitted a final undertakings proposal, which includes $2.2 billion in divestitures, to the European Commission in an attempt to gain approval  for their  merger.
In a press release Thursday, General Electric said it is "not optimistic that its proposal will meet with European 
regulatoryapproval."

General Electric said "the proposed divestitures are far short of the European Commission's demands, which seek billions more."

Jack Welch, chairman and chief executive of General Electric said, "Jeff Immelt and I wanted to complete the transaction but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal. The Commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point. This shows you are never too old to get surprised. In this case, the European regulators demands exceeded anything I or our European advisors imagined, and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the U.S. and Canada."
Jeffrey Inmelt is Welch's named successor.
The undertakings propose divestitures of $2.2 billion in revenue in Honeywell's Aerospace business.

These include a new business and regional jet engine, air turbine starters and certain avionics and non-avionics products.

General Electric also offered to set up GE Capital Aviation Services as a separate 'ring-fenced' entity to deal with Honeywell avionics and non-avionics products "at arms length." The operation would remain 100% owned and managed by GE.

The most recent version of the European Commission's Merger Task Force demands, had they been accepted by the companies, would have required the divestiture of virtually all of Honeywell's avionics business and its APU business.
General Electric said the proposed undertakings, in the "unlikely event they were accepted", would only
"modestly" reduce the positive impacts of the merger.

The divestitures would reduce Honeywell's $25 billion in revenues by 9% and revenues of the combined proposed combined company by about 1.5%.

The $3 billion of "synergies" that were originally projected for the acquisition would remain largely intact and the estimated increase in earnings per share in the first full year of combined operations would be reduced to 9 cents from 11 cents.

Upon approval, General Electric sees no change in its long-term expectations that the Honeywell acquisition would increase earnings growth by 1% to 2%.

Separately, Honeywell said it fully supports General Electric's proposal to the EC, but added that it has a comprehensive contingency plan in place if it continues as an independent company

Michael R. Bonsignore, Honeywell chairman and chief executive, said the proposal is "fully responsive to the substance of the issues raised by the European Commission"

Page 92 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He added that Honeywell is "committed to the merger and will continue to support GE in its efforts to obtain
European regulatory approval."

Since the merger agreement, Honeywell has been engaged in a restructuring that has reduced its annual expenses by about $600 million, and reduced its worldwide work force by 10%.
Based on the terms of the Honeywell merger, General Electric will swap 1.055 shares for each Honeywell share. General Electric's New York Stock Exchange listed shares have been trading around $49 on heavy volume
Thursday morning. A $49 share price would value Honeywell's shares at around $51.70 each.

Honeywell recently traded at $37.40, down 4.86, or 11%. The widening spread between Honeywell's share price and the deal's terms suggests that Wall Street is skeptical that the deal will go through.
The proposed merger, valued at about $40.6 billion on Wednesday, has continued to experience scrutiny from the
EC, although the U.S. Justice Department cleared the deal in early May.

To gain U.S. approval, GE agreed to sell Honeywell's helicopter-engine unit and take other steps to protect competition.

The two companies initially said that the deal, announced in October, faced no antitrust problems, and that they hoped to complete it by February.

European regulators have focused on GE's domination of large commercial aircraft-engine sales - dwarfing United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit and Rolls-Royce PLC (U.RR) - and found that GE exerts market power through the GE Capital unit, the world's largest financer of aircraft purchases.
Investigators raised concerns that a bias toward buying aircraft fitted only with GE engines could be transferred to
Honeywell to drive sales of its cockpit electronics, landing gear, power units and other products.

The EC found that, due to the breadth of GE's many businesses, the conglomerate "appears to have access to sensitive business information of third parties that are or may become customers or business partners of GE, and, at the same time, its competitors."
The the commission also voiced concern over the bundling of products and services, such as GE jet engines with
Honeywell's avionics. GE has indicated it is prepared to break out pricing for each component.

The EC antitrust enforcers reportedly want the company to spin off Gecas, GE's aircraft leasing and financing arm, to existing shareholders.

General Electric has indicated it is prepared to separate managements and amend Gecas's purchasing policies, though it opposes complete divestment of a business that is crucial to its overall performance.

From the beginning of the Honeywell deal, GE has wanted to create a seamless range of aerospace products combining GE jet engines with Honeywell's cockpit instruments and avionics equipment, and then mesh them with maintenance and data-collection services.

EU Taking Another  Tough Stance On An American  Deal
By Colleen DeBaise
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
662 words
14 June 2001
19:26
Dow Jones News Service
DJ

(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If  General Electric  Co. (GE) loses its fight to win European approval  to acquire Honeywell  International Inc. (HON), it won't be the first time Europeanregulators have stood in the way of an American corporate deal.

Europe has become a tougher environment for mergers, with EuropeanCompetition Commissioner Mario Monti in his two years on the job blocking or requiring substantial modifications to several mergers, including the MCI WorldCom/Sprint deal. Even before  Monti, the power of European regulators was evident in 1997, when they raised major objections to Boeing Co.'s (BA) impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.
While the Justice Department has already cleared GE's $41 billion bid For Honeywell with minor concessions, the
European Commission's Merger Task Force has demanded far greater divestitures. Antitrust experts say
Europe's use of a different set of legal standards when considering mergers sometimes leads to such a conflict
with U.S. authorities.

"It's not like (European regulators) have set up a special tribunal to persecute American companies, it's just the way they do business," says Charles Biggio, an antitrust attorney with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in New York and a former Justice Department official. "The differences...have been recognized for some time."

Ernest Gellhorn, a law professor at George Mason University, says European regulators perhaps weigh other issues - such as a merger's effect on employment - more heavily than their U.S. counterparts.
"They focus more narrowly on the impact on the European
Union, whereas the U.S. authorities are focused on the impact on competition in the United States," he said. Antitrust attorneys compared GE's battle to secure European approval to Boeing's fight to win European backing
for its $16.3 billion purchase of McDonnell Douglas. In both cases, the deals had been cleared by U.S. authorities
but ran into hurdles with Europe.

Ultimately, Boeing provided enough concessions to satisfy the European Commission, and the deal went though. Antitrust attorney Biggio said GE and Honeywell, similarly, are "negotiating now (with the EU) over what's going to fix the problems."

As reported, GE and Honeywell have offered to divest $2.2 billion in Honeywell's aerospace business, although it's unclear whether that offer will satisfy the commission.

The European Commission, under Monti, has become increasingly more aggressive in demanding concessions from merger partners. The commissioner, for instance, threatened to block America Online's (AOL) $117.8 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., approving it only after the companies severed ties with German media group Bertelsmann AG.

A separate deal - Time Warner's proposed $20 billion purchase of EMI Music Group PLC - faced a near-certain veto from the European Commission last year and was ultimately scrapped.

Donald I. Baker, an antitrust attorney with Baker & Miller and former head of the antitrust division of the Justice Department, says Europeans "seem more willing to listen seriously to complaints from competitors than Americans."
Page 94 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Looking ahead, Baker said the U.S. and E.U. "may well be in for a period of greater divergence in how we handle mergers."

At the same time, European regulators haven't always held conflicting viewpoints from U.S. authorities. WorldCom's $115 billion merger with Sprint - touted as the largest takeover in history - collapsed last year when authorities on both sides of the ocean announced efforts to block the deal.

Biggio says the EU, the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ actively discuss cases to minimize conflict in their conclusions. The regulatory bodies often express similar concerns over antitrust issues, he says. But when the two sides differ over whether to grant approval - as appears to be the case with the GE/Honeywell merger - "it can become a pretty substantial sore point," he said.

N.Y. Stocks Tumble; DJIA's Lowest Close Since April 25
By Robert O'Brien

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply after investors burnt by the apparent collapse of the  merger of General Electric  and Honeywell  scrambled to limit their fallout from some unsuccessful trades, while traders speculated about any successive deals.

Shares of Honeywell  International sank $5.16 to $37.10, after opposition by  European regulators to the takeover by GE appeared to scuttle any chance of a successful conclusion to the combination of the two businesses. Trading in  Honeywell  shares picked up sharply, with 82.5 million shares changing hands in the session, versus average daily volume of 5.5 million shares.

Shares of GE, meanwhile, managed to finish higher on the session, up 1.01 to 48.86, though not for fundamental reasons. Under traditional merger arbitrage, investors buy the stock of the target company, while "shorting" - that is, betting on the decline - of the acquiring company; arbitrageurs make money on the spread between the trading price of the target and the actual price the acquirer pays.

On Thursday, those traders had to quickly sell their shares of Honeywell, which led to the sharp decline, while covering their short bets on GE by buying shares of the stock.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the session down 181.49 points, a loss of 1.67%, at 10690.13; it marked the lowest the industrial average has closed in over a month, since it ended at 10625.20 on April 25. Weakness in shares of United Technologies, another component of the Dow industrials, contributed to the declines, as investors speculated about whether the industrial gaint would reenter the bidding for Honeywell. United Technologies lost 3.16 to 77.10
The Nasdaq Composite Index also weakened badly on the day, falling 77.58, or 3.66%, to 2044.08.
On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 934 issues advancing, 2,145 declining and 187 unchanged. NYSE volume totaled 1,220,654,370 shares, compared with 1,057,826,000 Wednesday.
The NYSE Composite Index was 623.96, down 8.76. The average price per share fell 52 cents.

More worries about the earnings outlook for the high-technology sector following the release of several more profit warnings wrought havoc in the group again.
"There are several ramifications to seeing this deal fall apart," Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies,
said Thursday, among them a trend toward protectionist government policies, rather than free-market forces. With
the acute sensitivity to earnings forecasts, "It's hit the Street when we don't have the stomach for any kind of
pain," Hogan added.

Shares of several software developers weakened badly on the day. Shares of Micromuse, which lost 19% Wednesday, fell 11.19 to 24.06 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, and sank near a 52-week low of 23.20, set April
4. Company officials, appearing at an investment conference Wednesday, unsettled investors with remarks about how challenging the environment has been in the software market. Several analysts following the company reduced earnings forecasts following those remarks.

Shares of database software maker Oracle retreated 65 cents to 14.85 on Nasdaq, ahead of the company's release of quarterly results, slated for Monday.
Page 97 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Shares of PeopleSoft struggled, falling 4.21 to 38.99 on Nasdaq. The loss came despite some upbeat comments from Dain Rauscher Wessels, which started coverage of the enterprise software developer with a buy rating, showing how challenging the environment in software proved to be Thursday.

Computer-products distributor Ingram Micro fell 1 to 13.06, after the company said it expected to break even, and might post a loss, for the second quarter, owing to weak demand.

Corning fell 1.35 to 16. Merrill Lynch cut its rating on shares of the Corning, N.Y., maker of optical fiber; the firm said Corning's high-margin optical fiber pricing and sales will fall below expectations over the next several quarters.

The earnings pessimism proved so daunting, even denials that a company's earnings were at risk weren't enough to support a stock. Shares of Texas Instruments, for example, dropped 2.51 to 31.51, even though the chip and handset maker's chief operating officer insisted at a conference Wednesday that the company would live up to forecasts.
Shares of Intel fell 1.45 to 27.61 on Nasdaq, after officials of the chip-making giant, appearing at a conference in
New York, said conditions in the communications market won't improve until 2002.

Affiliated Computer Services declined 3.05 to 73.50. Lehman Brothers reduced its rating on the Dallas computer-services concern, saying the stock had reached its target price. The stock climbed to a 52-week high Wednesday.

Check Point Software fell in morning trade after Salomon Smith Barney reduced its earnings forecast for the Redwood City, Calif., developer of network security software products. However, the stock rebounded by the close, making up its decline, and ending 83 cents higher at 43.95 on Nasdaq.

Lucent Technologies shed 49 cents to 6.75. The Murray Hill, N.J., telecommunications equipment maker's deal to sell two manufacturing plants to Flextronics International in order to raise cash has fallen through.

Shares of Flextronics, a Singapore contract electronics maker, declined 2.10 to 20.70 on Nasdaq in a tough session for equipment makers.

Level 3 Communications surrendered 49 cents to 7.96 on Nasdaq, falling to a 52-week low intraday. An analyst at a brokerage firm, Kaufman Brothers, said the Broomfield, Colo., telecommunications service provider is pursuing
a work-force reduction of 10%, as well as a delay or cancellation of some of its planned collocation buildout. The company couldn't be reached for comment.
Charles Schwab lost 1.32 to 16.03. The San Francisco discount brokerage concern reported that trading levels in
May fell 11% from year-earlier results, and 7% from April totals.

Schlumberger fell 3.32 to 56.90. The New York oil services concern said that its revenues for the businesses it acquired with Sema PLC will come in below its estimates owing to weakness in the telecommunications industry and further weakness of the European currency versus the dollar. Schlumberger closed the Sema acquisition in April.

Gentex lost 4.18 to 24.80 on Nasdaq. The Zeeland, Mich., auto-parts supplier late Wednesday warned that its second-quarter earnings will come in below analysts' projections.

The American depositary receipts of Irish pharmaceuticals maker Elan gained 3.44 to 60.05, amid what an analyst described as anticipation of approvals for drugs in the company's development pipeline.

CNF lost 1.24 to 29.24. The Palo Alto, Calif., trucking and freight-hauling concern reduced its second-quarter earnings projections, saying it planned to record a charge related to its Emery Worldwide Airlines operation.

Hospitals operator Community Health Systems, Brentwood, Tenn., gained 46 cents to 28.01, on anticipation of federal legislation that could send up to $15 billion to rural hospitals.

Some Arbs Continue  To Bet On GE-Honeywell  Going Through
By Christiane Bird

(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As General Electric  Co.'s (GE) plans to buy Honeywell  International Inc. (HON) seemed Thursday to fall victim to European competition concerns, some merger-arbitrage hedge fund managers haven't given up hope.

Meredith Jones, vice president and director of research at Van Hedge Fund Advisors International Inc., a company that advises institutions and high-net-worth individuals, noted that analysts are describing Thursday's events as a "momentary blip" in the negotiating process. The sense is that the deal may still go through, she said.

Among the four or five merger-arbitrage managers Jones spoke with on Thursday, about half said they were going to maintain their positions in Honeywell and half said they were getting out, she said.

Andrew Kopperl, a merger-arbitrage manager and managing director for Pegasus Investments Inc., Boston, also said that he believes the deal will still go through.

Either way, said Jones, "a lot of funds have as many as 50 to 100 positions, so while this will have impact, it shouldn't be significant."

"There are a great many political sensitivities at work here...," Kopperl said. "Most of the airline industry and customers of GE and Honeywell are in support of the deal. The key European interests, including Rolls Royce and Airbus, are generally supportive of the deal. So whose interests are Mario Monti representing?"
Mario Monti is the chief E.U. Competition Commissioner who has expressed concerns about the acquisition. Kopperl said that his company has an investment in the GE-Honeywell deal, but declined to comment on when he
first began investing or on whether Pegasus is holding onto all of its position.

Kopperl also said that whether or not the deal goes through, Honeywell has interesting prospects for the future. Among these are the fact that it may be attractive to other companies such as United Technologies Corp. (UTX), Tyco International Ltd. (TYC), and others, he said. "Someone else will pick it up, absolutely," he said.

Kopperl also noted that many institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds were stepping up their investments in Honeywell on Thursday.

In contrast, David Jarvis, manager of the Ascendant Limited Partnership, a merger-arbitrage fund in Canada, said that he largely got out of GE-Honeywell last week because he does not believe the deal will go through.
"We started investing in February by shorting GE and going long on Honeywell, and later added Honeywell
'puts,"' he said. "But last week, we began to get a sense that things weren't going right, and closed off our
GE-Honeywell position, leaving the 'puts' in place."

"Puts" refer to put options, which grant an investor the right to sell a stock at a specified price even if it goes beneath that price. The price that Jarvis had on Honeywell was $42.50.

"We're in a no-lose situation," he said, noting that if Honeywell's stock continues to fall, the fund is locked into a small profit and if it rises, they will profit even more.

Jarvis attributed his early doubts over the GE-Honeywell deal to the fact that he is based in Canada. "On the surface, the deal makes sense, but from Canada, we could see a growing divergence between the views of Europe and America," he said.

Mark Strome, a risk-arbitrage manager and president of Strome Investment Management, Santa Monica, Calif., is not invested in the GE-Honeywell deal. However, he said he thought that many other merger-arbitrage managers probably are, and that he expects them to "put the trade on." Many managers started going long on Honeywell
and short on GE when the spread between share prices was $2 to $3, and since the spread went to $20 today, obviously people are getting hurt, he said

Barry Colvin, chief operations officer at Tremont Advisors Inc., a hedge fund consulting group, said that only about 15-20% of hedge funds are involved in "event-driven" investment strategies, and that of those, only some are involved in merger-arbitrage.
Among those, some funds have a more conservative strategy which would have led them to get out of
GE-Honeywell two to three weeks ago, he said.

However, "others are more aggressive, and as the spread widened, they may have taken even greater risks...," he said. "If a fund manager is talented, he would not be hurt too badly, but I would expect many to be down a couple of percentage points."

EU Commission "Surprised" By GE Offer On Merger -Off'l

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- A European Union Commission official close to the talks with General Electric  Co. (GE) on its $40 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. (HON) said he was surprised that GE made a final offer on divestments to assure E.U. approval.
"I didn't think that they would do this," he said on condition of anonymity. "We're a bit surprised."
GE and Honeywell offered $2.2 billion in sales of Honeywell's aerospace business and were "far short of the
European Commission's demands, which seek billion more."
GE said it's "not optimistic that its proposal will meet with European regulatory approval."
A Commission spokesman had no immediate comment, but said the E.U. will release a statement soon.


The E.U. source had no comment when asked whether the Commission will accept GE's final offer, but Brussels-based lawyers think E.U. acceptance is highly unlikely.

EU Commission To Maintain Timetable On GE-Honeywell
By Matthew Newman
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
655 words
14 June 2001

Dow Jones International News
DJI

(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- General Electric  Co.'s (GE) $40 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. (HON) is effectively dead, but the European Union will press on with its antitrust review until July 12, sources close to the deal said Thursday.

The E.U.'s executive arm, known as the Commission, is likely to follow a strict timetable on considering  GE's new concessions on its  merger, unless GE formally withdraws the deal.
"The Commission will go through the motions," said a source close to the deal.

A Commission official said the E.U.'s merger task force has handled the case like any other merger and will continue to follow routine procedure.

"The Commission has to go through the procedures and the timetable has to remain the same," said one veteran competition lawyer who is familiar with the Commission's antitrust procedures.

The only way the timetable would change is if GE withdraws its merger, which could happen if Honeywell decides to abandon its merger agreement with GE, the source said.
That means the Commission will adhere to the following timeframe:

- After Thursday's 2200 GMT deadline for GE remedies passes, the Commission will circulate GE's final proposals to the companies, competitors and national antitrust authorities.

- The merger task force will review the proposals and comments by companies and national authorities, and make a recommendation to the Commission.
- The Commission's final decision on the case is likely to come on July 4, and no later than July 12.

Under E.U. rules, the Commission must make a decision July 12, which is four months after GE notified the Commission of the merger. Most observers expect a decision Wednesday, July 4, because the Commission, which usually meets on Wednesdays, would want to avoid making a last-minute decision on Wednesday, July 11.
Deal Collapses On Commission Demand To Sell Off GECAS

The deal faltered because the two sides couldn't agree on what remedies GE should make regarding its aircraft leasing and financing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services or GECAS.

To appease E.U. regulators, GE earlier Thursday offered to divest $2.2 billion of revenues derived from Honeywell's aerospace business and to set up GECAS as a separate "ring-fenced" unit to deal at arms length with Honeywell avionics and non-avionics products.

GE's promise that GECAS would maintain an arm's-length relationship with Honeywell was designed to ensure that GECAS doesn't discriminate against Honeywell's rivals.

But the offer didn't go far enough for the Commission's Merger Task Force, which continued to press GE to spin off GECAS to the company's existing shareholders, the source said.
GE negotiators had warned the Commission that such a move would be unacceptable and kill the deal.

Page 103 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"GE put $2 billion plus on the table and the EU wanted more - they wanted to sell all or part of GECAS," the source said.
"It's over from the GE side," the source said. "GE isn't going to do anything."

The competition lawyer says the Commission won't back down now and approve the deal following the strong critique of the Commission in GE's statement.

"It would be a humiliation if the E.U. accepts the deal now because of the GE statement," the competition lawyer says.

In a statement, GE Chief Executive Jack Welch said the Commission went too far: "(Chairman-elect) Jeff Immelt and I wanted to complete the transaction but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal. The Commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point...and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the U.S. and Canada."

Newscast:  GE chairman  seeks Bush's  help to gain European approval  of Honeywell  takeover

NANETTE HANSEN, anchor: We begin with  GE, the parent of this network, battling to bring its  merger with Honeywell  to life; Chairman and CEO Jack Welch fighting to sell  regulators in Europe on the deal before a midnight deadline. Now he's even asking the White House for help. CNBC's Leslie Laroche is in London. She has the very latest on this for us. What's going on, Leslie?
LESLIE LAROCHE reporting:

Well, good morning, Nanette. The clock is ticking on that GE-Honeywell deal, and as you mentioned, chairman Cnd CEO Jack Welch seems to be pulling out all the stops. He has asked for President Bush's assistance in gaining European approval of that takeover of Honeywell. A spokesman for the president says Bush may bring up the issue today at an EU summit in Sweden.

Now GE does have until midnight tonight to submit its final proposal to the European Commission, and while the US gave the green light to the merger with little concessions, the EC is taking a tougher line and asking GE to divest key assets, including Honeywell's avionics division.

GE Honeywell  Deal Dead?; CNNfn

JAN HOPKINS, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP:  GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/) proposed merger with Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) looks highly unlikely. GE says it`s not optimistic and according to Reuters Group (URL:  http://www.reuters.com/) , a US official says that Europeanregulators appear to have blocked the deal. My next guest is an  antitrust lawyer who worked on a merger that faced similar legal problems, the marriage of Boeing (URL:  http://www.boeing.com/) and McDonnell Douglas. Mark Schechter is partner at Howrey & Simon. He joins us from Washington. So why is the  European commission such a force in US mergers?

MARK SCHECHTER, HOWREY AND SIMON: Well, it`s a relatively recent phenomenon. The EC has come into its own and when it has a problem with a proposed merger, it is prepared to block it. In fact, this is a unique circumstance because if it does block this one, it will be the first time in history, as far as I can gather, that the EC has blocked a merger of two American companies when the US antitrust agencies have cleared it.
HOPKINS: And they need this approval in order to do business in Europe, is that right?

SCHECHTER: That`s right. There is no practical way that I`m aware of for companies with a global reach to be able to operate in defiance of a European commission order.

HOPKINS: So what went wrong here? Was it really misjudging what the issues were in Europe? Did Jack Welch have too much [INAUDIBLE] or something going into these meetings?

SCHECHTER: Well, I wasn`t there. Excuse me, I don`t know exactly what happen. It is true that the EC has a somewhat different standard that is applied in the United States to mergers. It`s called create or maintain a dominant position, in this case in avionics and the positions that Europe is taking are certainly aggressive ones relative to standards that would be applied in the United States.

HOPKINS: So, I mean again, back to the issues. So the GE people were just totally blind-sided? They didn`t have the right research or what happened?

SCHECHTER: I can`t tell you. What I can tell you, though, is that although this is a merger of two American firms, much of the opposition that was mounted to this deal was by other US firms, both engine producers and avionic producers, who had expressed the concern that as a result of this deal, they would be made less effective competitors in the market. There were in addition, some European competitors and that was really the heart of
the challenge that was mounted to this deal. And it`s perhaps the case that the parties didn`t anticipate there would be this much reaction, negative reaction to their deal.

HOPKINS: Now, as mergers and acquisition lawyer, are you telling clients, potential clients that might be looking at mergers that they should look a little bit more carefully because of what`s going on in Europe?

SCHECHTER: Well I tell you my experience is that if we have a proposed transaction that has a significant component in Europe or significant presence in Europe, we look very carefully at the European side of the deal and that is part of our advice, part of out counseling and part of our advocacy as was the case in the McDonnell Douglas Boeing merger.

BERNIE SCHAFFER: Mark, Bernie Schaffer here. The WorldCom (URL:  http://www.wcom.com/) /Sprint PCS (URL: http://www.sprintpcs.com/) merger, I`m recalling there were European problems with that as well. Is there any kind of a trend there, you know, combining that with the GE situation?



Page 106 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SCHECHTER: I think probably not. We were active in that particular matter on behalf of one of the opponents to that deal. And in that case there was fairly strong convergence between the European antitrust authorities and the United States antitrust authorities in opposing the deal. For essentially the same reasons.

GE/Honeywell/EC  -7: Justice  Dept Cleared Deal In May
349 words
14 June 2001
15:10
Dow Jones News Service
DJ
English
(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
The proposed merger, valued at about $40.6 billion on Wednesday, has continued to experience scrutiny from the EC, although the U.S. Justice Department cleared the deal in early May.
To gain U.S.  approval,  GE agreed to sell Honeywell's  helicopter-engine unit and take other steps to protect
competition.

The two companies initially said that the deal, announced in October, faced no antitrust problems, and that they hoped to complete it by February.

European regulators have focused on GE's domination of large commercial aircraft-engine sales - dwarfing United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit and Rolls-Royce PLC (U.RR) - and found that GE exerts market power through the GE Capital unit, the world's largest financer of aircraft purchases.
Investigators raised concerns that a bias toward buying aircraft fitted only with GE engines could be transferred to
Honeywell to drive sales of its cockpit electronics, landing gear, power units and other products.

The EC found that, due to the breadth of GE's many businesses, the conglomerate "appears to have access to sensitive business information of third parties that are or may become customers or business partners of GE, and, at the same time, its competitors."
The the commission also voiced concern over the bundling of products and services, such as GE jet engines with
Honeywell's avionics. GE has indicated it is prepared to break out pricing for each component.

The EC antitrust enforcers reportedly want the company to spin off Gecas, GE's aircraft leasing and financing arm, to existing shareholders.

General Electric has indicated it is prepared to separate managements and amend Gecas's purchasing policies, though it opposes complete divestment of a business that is crucial to its overall performance.

From the beginning of the Honeywell deal, GE has wanted to create a seamless range of aerospace products combining GE jet engines with Honeywell's cockpit instruments and avionics equipment, and then mesh them with maintenance and data-collection services.

Huge rift separate GE, Honeywell  and EU to get merger approval

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International said Thursday the  European Union had made too many "extraordinary demands" for approval  of their merger, threatening the creation of one of the world's largest industrial companies.

The EU's top antitrust official, Mario  Monti, expressed "regret" at the companies' position, but said his office would continue to review the deal "unless the  merger notification is formally withdrawn."
A source close to the deal said the GE team left Brussels on Thursday and considered the dlrs 41 billion deal
"effectively dead.
"It's over from the GE side," the source said on condition of anonymity. "GE isn't going to do anything." A final decision by the 15-nation EU is due July 12. GE said it was "not optimistic" about its chances. Rejection would be a personal blow for GE chief executive Jack Welch, one of the foremost U.S. business
leaders, who postponed his retirement until the end of 2001 to oversee the merger. This week, he even appealed
to the White House for help in persuading the EU to approve it.

In a statement, Welch said his company "wanted to complete the transaction but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal.

"The (EU) Commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point," he said, adding they "exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined."

GE currently dominates the market for aircraft engines and servicing, while Honeywell is the predominant supplier of aircraft electronics for commercial jets and air traffic control systems.
The two companies said they submitted a final package of concessions to the EU's antitrust office, including dlrs
2.2 billion in divestitures in Honeywell's aerospace business.

The plan would reduce Honeywell's dlrs 25 billion in revenues by 9 percent, and combined GE-Honeywell revenues would decline by about 1.5 percent.

But the GE statement said the EU was seeking "billions more" that it had proposed, including virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.
The statement did not include the value of those operations.

In his statement, though, Monti said he and his staff were not necessarily seeking "further divestments in the aerospace industry but rather a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior of GECAS," GE Capital Aviation Services.
"We regret that this avenue has not been pursued," he said.
Monti's office previously cited concerns about the impact on competition of "bundling" GE jet engines with
Honeywell electronics and GECAS financing.

Page 109 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The market power of GECAS has always been one of the biggest problems cited by EU regulators. GECAS is one of the world's leading buyers of commercial aircraft, which it later sells or leases to airlines and other customers.
The EU is worried GE could use GECAS' financial clout to sway airlines and aircraft manufacturers to choose GE
engines over competing brands made by such companies as Rolls-Royce PLC and Pratt & Whitney.
GE said Thursday that it offered to set up GECAS as a separate "ring-fenced" entity to deal at arms length with
Honeywell, a move designed to ensure that GECAS doesn't discriminate against Honeywell's rivals.

But that apparently did not go far enough to satisfy the Commission's Merger Task Force, which initially pressed GE to spin off GECAS to the company's existing shareholders. GE negotiators had dismissed that option as unacceptable.

After the midnight Thursday deadline for proposals to soothe antitrust worries, the Commission will pass along the offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment.

The office then will assess the responses and make its final recommendation to the full Commission, which will rule no later than July 12.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.
The U.S. Justice Department approved the GE-Honeywell deal in May.
Welch said the EU's demands "differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the U.S. and Canada." "This shows you are never too old to get surprised," he said.
Europe has become a tougher environment for mergers, with Monti in his two years on the job blocking or requiring substantial modifications to several high-profile deals, including the MCI WorldCom-Sprint deal.

Some fear an EU decision to block the GE-Honeywell deal could spark a trans-Atlantic trade war, as nearly happened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

"It's not like (European regulators) have set up a special tribunal to persecute American companies, it's just the way they do business," said Charles Biggio, an antitrust attorney with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in New York and a former Justice Department official.

Ernest Gellhorn, a law professor at George Mason University, says European regulators perhaps weigh other issues - such as a merger's effect on employment - more heavily than their U.S. counterparts.

"They focus more narrowly on the impact on the European Union, whereas the U.S. authorities are focused on the impact on competition in the United States," he said.

Honeywell shares fell dlrs 3.20, or 7.6 percent, to dlrs 39.06 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where GE shares were up dlrs 1.63, or 3.4 percent, to dlrs 49.48.

EU says won't be swayed by Bush on deciding GE-Honeywell merger

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  European Union antitrust regulators said Thursday they would not be swayed by political pressure in deciding whether to approve General Electric  Co.'s dlrs 41 billion  merger with Honeywell International Inc.

A spokeswoman for  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti called "interesting" reports that  GE chief executive Jack Welch had asked U.S. President George W. Bush to plead  GE's case during his meetings Thursday with  EU leaders in Sweden.

"As to political involvement, it's something that can happen and has happened in the past, but it doesn't impress the Commission," spokeswoman Amelia Torres said.

Torres insisted the EU Commission decides cases "purely on competition grounds ... regardless of whether the companies involved are based in Europe or elsewhere in the world.
"That's what the Commission has always done and will continue doing," she said.

Welch met twice with Monti on Wednesday to try to satisfy EU objections to the deal. The deadline for GE to offer concessions is midnight Thursday. A decision is due July 12.

Before the second meeting broke, an EU source said that the "atmosphere is still good" and both sides "are working toward a solution."

Monti's office has cited concerns about the deal's potential to reduce competition in areas such as regional-jet engines, where GE and Honeywell dominate the market, as well as the impact on competition of "bundling" GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS).

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  General Electric  Co. CEO Jack Welch said Thursday the commitments his company and Honeywell  International were willing to make to get European Union approval  for their merger fell far short of EU demands, making it unlikely the dlrs 41 billion merger will get the backing of the 15-nation bloc.

Welch said in a statement his company "wanted to complete the transaction but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal."
"The Commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point."

The two companies submitted to the EU's antitrust office a final package of concessions they were willing to make, including dlrs 2.2 billion divestitures in Honeywell's Aerospace business.

But the statement said "the proposed divestitures are far short of the European Commission's demands which seek billions more than the proposed GE divestitures."

Welch and EU antitrust Commissioner Mario Monti had a telephone conversation early Thursday to discuss their differences.

Welch met twice with Monti on Wednesday to try to satisfy EU objections to the deal. The deadline for GE to offer concessions is midnight Thursday. A decision is due July 12.

Before the second meeting broke, an EU source said that the "atmosphere is still good" and both sides "are working toward a solution."
The press release of GE shed a different light.

Monti's office has cited concerns about the deal's potential to reduce competition in areas such as regional-jet engines, where GE and Honeywell dominate the market, as well as the impact on competition of "bundling" GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS).
GECAS is also the world's second-biggest buyer of airplanes, which it then leases to airlines and others.

GE said in Thursday that it offered to set up GECAS as a separate "ring-fenced" entity "to deal at arms length with Honeywell.

MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 14, 2001--Honeywell  (NYSE: HON) today said that it fully supports the filing made by General Electric  (NYSE:  GE) with the European Commission related to the proposed GE/Honeywell  merger.

"We believe the  GE filing is fully responsive to the substance of the issues raised by the  European                       Commission," said Michael R. Bonsignore,  Honeywell's  Chairman and CEO. "We remain committed to the merger and will continue to support  GE in its efforts to obtain  European regulatory approval."

"While continuing to support the merger, we have a comprehensive contingency plan in place if we must move forward as an independent company," Bonsignore said. "Honeywell remains a fundamentally strong, $25 billion global company with a promising future, strong financial performance, and world-class franchises in aerospace, automation, specialty materials and automotive markets."

GE's merger plan on ropes

The megadeal between  General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International appears to be falling apart.
Problems with European regulators make it unlikely the $41 billion linkup will get the backing of the 15-nation
European Commission, GE said today.

GE Chairman and CEO Jack Welch said the European Commission was asking for too many concessions to get the merger approved. GE "wanted to complete the transaction, but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal," he said in a statement. "The commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point."
"The European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined," he said. If approved, the merger would double the size of GE's Evendale- based aircraft engines business. Honeywell's Phoenix-based aerospace business, as large as GE's in annual revenues, makes and services
aircraft engines and manufactures parts related to jet propulsion systems, landing systems, avionics and aircraft
cockpits.

Two weeks ago, GE Aircraft Engines President and CEO David L. Calhoun said GE officials were hopeful Europe would approve the merger. Teams of workers there had been heavily involved in planning for the integration of
the two businesses and were even dreaming up a new name for the company, which would be based in
Evendale.

The deal had been viewed as good for GEAE, one of the area's largest employers with 8,600 workers, because there was very little overlap between the GE and Honeywell product lines. Calhoun said in December that the merger would make GEAE twice as profitable and make it a player in the cockpit equipment and business jet markets.

The U.S. Justice Department agreement approved the deal last month, requiring only that Honeywell divest its helicopter engine business and authorize new third-party maintenance and repair service for some of its aircraft engines.

But the deal faced much tougher scrutiny in Europe. The two companies submitted to the EC's antitrust office a final package of concessions they were willing to make, including $2.2 billion in divestitures in Honeywell's aerospace business.

But the GE statement said the proposed selloffs "are far short of the European Commission's demands which seek billions more than the proposed GE divestitures."

Welch and EC antitrust Commissioner Mario Monti had a telephone conversation early today to discuss their differences.Welch met twice with Monti Wednesday. The deadline for GE to offer concessions is midnight tonight in Brussels. A decision is due July 12.

GE's irresistible Welch collides with EU's immovable Monti over Honeywell

BRUSSELS (AP) _  General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International said Thursday the  European Union is demanding too many concessions from their proposed merger, making it unlikely the $41-billion-US linkup will get EU approval.

GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch stated that ``we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal.''
The demands of the 15-country EU show ``you are never too old to get surprised,'' Welch added.
``In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined.''

If the deal collapses, it would be a personal blow for Welch, who postponed his retirement until the end of 2001 to oversee the merger.

The EU's competition worries are based on GE's dominant position in the market for aircraft engines, servicing and financing, while Honeywell is the dominant supplier of aircraft electronics for commercial jets and air traffic control systems.

Honeywell said in a separate statement Thursday that it has ``a comprehensive contingency plan in place if we must move forward as an independent company.''

The two companies said they submitted a final package of concessions to the EU's antitrust office, including divestitures worth $2.2 billion US in Honeywell's aerospace business.

The plan would reduce Honeywell's $25 billion in revenue by nine per cent, and combined GE-Honeywell revenue would decline by 1.5 per cent.

However, the GE statement said, the proposed selloffs ``are far short of the European Commission's demands which seek billions more than the proposed GE divestitures.''

GE said regulators were demanding divestiture of virtually all of Honeywell's aviation electronics business and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.

EU antitrust commissioner Mario Monti issued a statement saying European regulators were still ``giving guidance on how best to resolve the remaining competition concerns.''

``As I have indicated to Mr. Welch, we were ready to consider improved commitments until the legal deadline'' of midnight Thursday in Brussels.

To do business in Europe, transnational companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by U.S. law to do business in America.
An EU decision to block the deal could spark a transatlantic trade war, as nearly happened in 1997 when the EU
objected to Boeing's merger with McDonnell Douglas.
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, travelling with President George W. Bush in Sweden, said Thursday that
Welch has contacted White House chief of staff Andrew Card about the conflict with the EU.

``I can't say specifically if there was a request, what it was,'' Fleischer said.
``The United States obviously supports the merger.''
Welch and Monti talked early Thursday to discuss their differences. They also met twice on Wednesday. A final decision by EU regulators on the deal is expected by July 12.
GE said it is not optimistic that its proposal will be approved.

Monti's office previously cited concerns about the deal's potential to reduce competition in areas such as regional-jet engines, where GE and Honeywell dominate the market, as well as the impact on competition of
``bundling'' GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services.
GE said it offered to set up GE Capital Aviation Services as a ``ring-fenced'' entity to deal at arm's length with
Honeywell.

AARON SCHACTER, anchor: Good morning, I'm Aaron Schacter in Los Angeles.

This is D-Day for  General Electric  in Europe. The company has until midnight to make concessions to the European Union if its proposed $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International is to be approved.  The major sticking point is the EU's call for GE to sell off parts of Honeywell's  aerospace division. GE chief Jack Welch met twice yesterday with Europe's top antitrust regulator.

Update On GE/Honywell  Regulatory Issues, Deal In Jeopardy

CNNfn: Market Coverage - Morning

RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: The big story, of course, we continue to follow is what`s going on with  GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/) and Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) ?

We`re going to take a phone call now from Michael Regan of Credit Suisse First Boston. He`s joining us on the phone from Paris to talk about the  GE/Honeywell merger. And, of course, the activity as of late has been centered in Europe.
Thanks for joining us on "Market Call", Michael.
MICHAEL REGAN, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON, PARIS: Hi Rhonda, how are you? SCHAFFLER: I`m doing pretty well.
What`s your sense of what`s going on now in Europe in regards to this deal?

REGAN: Well clearly, Rhonda, GE felt the need to put their best foot forward and make it definitive. And so they have offered what they think is both very reasonable and a big concession on their part in terms of getting this deal done.
SCHAFFLER: Wall Street is selling off Honeywell pretty dramatically. Is that selling justified?

REGAN: Well, I think that there`s a valid concern whether or not this deal will go through. We still think that there`s slightly better than a 50-50 chance. But the gap between what the EU has asked for, $6 billion of divestitures, and what GE has put as their best foot forward and their final offer at $2.2 billion, is pretty wide. And so I think the concern is focused on that-and rightly so.
SCHAFFLER: Jack Welch is known as somebody who gets things done.

REGAN: And he does get things done. But I think it`s important, Rhonda, to understand that GE has said all along they would not acquire Honeywell at any cost. And what we`ve seen today is them drawing the line at terms of what they`re willing to do to get this deal done. GE can bring a lot of value and add a lot of value to their franchise with Honeywell, but not if they`re forced to divest important pieces of that. And that`s what the EU has asked for and that`s just unacceptable.
SCHAFFLER: Michael, if this deal doesn`t work, does somebody else come up to the plate for Honeywell? REGAN: Well, I do think that Honeywell continues to have wonderful franchises both in aerospace and in the
industrial world, which are clearly very attractive to lots of different people. And I think part of the reason you`re
seeing Honeywell hold in here in the $38, $39 range is the expectation that perhaps somebody else would
emerge.
SCHAFFLER: Michael Regan of Credit Suisse First Boston, joining us from the phone, in Paris, tracking GE and
Honeywell. Thanks for joining us this morning.
REGAN: Thank you, Rhonda. Have a good day.

GE, EU begin last day of merger talks

General Electric  Co. Chairman Jack Welch met twice with EuropeanCompetition Commissioner Mario Monti yesterday, offering to divest more units to soothe  antitrust worries and win approval  to purchase Honeywell International Corp.

GE has until the end of today to make its final offer and close the $42 billion acquisition. After the first meeting with Monti, sources said Welch was pessimistic. But other sources said such pessimism was unjustified and progress was made.

These sources, all of whom are familiar with the deal, but from several perspectives, had no results from the second meeting.

While negotiations in Brussels were under way across town, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick - accompanying President Bush on a visit -weighed in on the $42 billion transaction to say America has a strong interest in fair treatment of GE and Honeywell.
A maker of everything from electronics for jetliners to thermostats, Morris Township-based Honeywell employs
3,000 people in New Jersey.

The U.S. Justice Department cleared the deal earlier this year, but the European Commission has said that the transaction, in its current form, fails to comply with European Union rules assuring fair competition.

GE offered yesterday to divest a package of Honeywell products that produce $2.1 billion in revenue annually, including avionics, regional jet engines, engine starters, ground proximity warning systems and more, sources said.

GE also offered to appoint independent directors and to separate the management of GE Capital Aviation Services, which buys, sells and leases commercial airplanes to airlines. It would also separate accounts for GE Capital Aviation Services and create an independent body to assure compliance.

GE's was trying to address the Commission's concerns that acquiring Honeywell will give GE a dominant position in manufacturing jet engines, avionics and other parts for large commercial jet aircraft.

The commission also is concerned that GE can use GE Capital Aviation Services to offer price breaks and financing to airlines in order to induce them to prefer GE products.

After Welch's first meeting with Monti, sources said he telephoned a U.S. government official to say the two sides were miles apart and not to involve Bush because it would do little good given the major differences. The second meeting was said to be a last-ditch effort.

But others said progress was made at the morning meeting and that, in any event, there was another day of negotiating available.
GE has until midnight tonight, Brussels time, to make its final offer.

Commission staff will present its recommendations to representatives of the 15 EU member countries' competition agencies on June 25. The Commission will vote on the recommendations July 4, after soliciting comment from customers and competitors that could be affected. The final deadline for action by the Commission is July 12.

Honeywell  has backup plan if merger with GE fails
215 words

English
(Copyright 2001)
NEW YORK, June 14 (AFP) - Honeywell  said Thursday it has a "contingency plan" should its planned  merger
with General Electric  fail to win European Commission approval.

The industrial conglomerate said it was prepared to continue its restructuring and continue as an independent company should the  merger effort fail.

Honeywell said it "fully supports" the filing made in Brussels earlier Thursday by GE to meet concerns about competition by divesting some 2.2 billion dollars in Honeywell assets, including its aerospace business.

"We believe the GE filing is fully responsive to the substance of the issues raised by the European Commission," said Michael Bonsignore, Honeywell's chairman and CEO.

"We remain committed to the merger and will continue to support GE in its efforts to obtain European regulatory approval."

After GE's filing in Brussels, Honeywell shares tumbled more than 12 percent to 36.90 dollars due to pessimism about the merger prospects.

Bonsignore said that Honeywell has "a comprehensive contingency plan in place if we must move forward as an independent company," Bonsignore said.

"Honeywell remains a fundamentally strong, 25-billion-dollar global company with a promising future, strong financial performance, and world-class franchises in aerospace, automation, specialty materials and automotive markets."

BRUSSELS, June 14 (AFP) - US firms  General Electric  and Honeywell  have offered to sell some assets in Honeywell's  Aerospace business but doubt it will be enough to win approval  from EUcompetition authorities for a merger, GE said on Thursday.

The proposed sales represented 2.2 billion dollars (2.6 billion  euros) of revenue but were "far short of the European Commission's demands which seek billions more than the proposed  GE divestitures", a  GE statement said.
"GE is not optimistic that its proposal will meet with European regulatory approval."

GE chairman Jack Welch said his group wanted to complete the transaction "but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal.
"The commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point.

"In this case the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisors imagined, and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the US and Canada."

GE said the concessions offered to the commission in the form of divestitures included a new business and regional jet engine, air turbine starters and certain avionics and non-avionics products.

GE had also offered to set up GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) as a separate "ring-fenced" entity to deal at arm's length with Honeywell avionics and non-avionics products.

These proposals, GE said, "in the unlikely event they were accepted", would modestly reduce the positive effect of the GE- Honeywell combination, reducing Honeywell's revenue of 25 billion dollars by nine percent and revenues of the combined entity by about 1.5 percent.

The expected synergies of the merger, amounting to three billion dollars, would remain largely unaffected and the estimated increase of earnings per share in the first full year of merged operations would be reduced from 11 cents to nine cents.

GE said the concessions offered to the commission in the form of divestitures included a new business and regional jet engine, air turbine starters and certain avionics and non-avionics products.

GE had also offered to set up GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) as a separate "ring-fenced" entity to deal at arm's length with Honeywell avionics and non-avionics products.

These proposals, GE said, "in the unlikely event they were accepted", would modestly reduce the positive effect of the GE- Honeywell combination, reducing Honeywell's revenue of 25 billion dollars by nine percent and revenues of the combined entity by about 1.5 percent.

The expected synergies of the merger, amounting to three billion dollars, would remain largely unaffected and the estimated increase of earnings per share in the first full year of merged operations would be reduced from 11 cents to nine cents.

'Financial Times': Midnight Deadline Looms for GE-HoneywellMerger

Ian Rodger of the "Financial Times" notes a midnight approval deadline for a General Electric and Honeywell  
merger.

DAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNN ANCHOR: As we have been telling you this morning, there is a midnight deadline looming over the GE-Honeywell  situation,  GE hoping for approval  from European regulators.
Let's go live now to London to the newsroom of "The Financial Times," where Ian Rodger has just come out of the
"FT"'s morning news conference.

Ian, we are just getting word from GE also this morning. Apparently, Jack Welch remains in Europe, I guess to continue to talk with the European regulators. However, they are not aware of any new meetings set up, and we also know that the White House administration has been briefed as to the current situation with the European regulators.
Good morning to you, first of all. What's the latest on your end?
IAN RODGER, "FINANCIAL TIMES": Well briefed, I suppose, is a bit of euphemism. My understanding is that
Jack Welch has gone to the White House and said, come on, get on board, give me a hand here.
Yesterday, as you may have noticed, Robert Zoellick stuck his oar in, saying the United States was very keen that
GE and Honeywell got fair treatment in Europe.

This is high noon. This is the last day. GE has to get what is called its undertakings, what it will do to try and make the commission happy, in by midnight tonight.

HAFFENREFFER: Why would the regulatory arms of the U.S. government and the European government be so different in their approach to this deal?

RODGER: That's a really tough question. There are a couple of possibilities. One is that they actually are secretly working together, and they've decided, in this case, the Europeans will play the bad cop and be the toughies.

The more likely case is that the Europeans are still sort of stretching their muscles. They're new at this game, in terms of dealing with global companies, and they're trying to see how strong they really are. In this case, the general impression is they may be biting off a bit more than they should chew, and the last couple of days we had the impression they're sort of retreating a bit.

And you know, we feel there's probably a deal here. One of their signs -- again, you can interpret it either good or bad -- is that all the usual sources that we talked to have gone to ground.

HAFFENREFFER: So how will this play out? Are we likely to see the company make some concessions, obviously not too major, not ones that would remove the very thing that attracted them to Honeywell in the first place.

RODGER: Well that's the tricky part, isn't it? What we've seen and what we have in the paper this morning is that the latest proposals GE has made are that it'll separate the accounts of GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) -- this is their aircraft leasing and finance arm -- introduce independent directors, and spin off Honeywell's regional jet engine business. And you sort of say is there going to be much synergy left?

Page 129 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But this will all play out over the next few weeks. The final bell is July 12, I think it is. That's when the commission will make its decision.
HAFFENREFFER: Ian, thank you very much. Until then, the clock ticks down to the deadline tonight. Ian Rodger at the "Financial Times."

THE PING PONG GAME between Brussels  merger cops and General Electric  Co.'s negotiators is straining the nerves of investors.

GE's bid for  Honeywell  International Inc. continues to wallow in  antitrust uncertainty. And arbitrageurs around the world are working the phones furiously to get the latest on the companies' talks with the  commission.

The carpet-bombing barrage of phone calls is jamming voice-mail boxes on more than one mobile phone. Everyone, it seems, is a target: GE's own lawyers, journalists, the commission's investigators and anyone remotely connected to them. One arb says he talked to someone who plays tennis with one of the Brussels merger cops. (He didn't learn much from him.)

The investors' jitters are understandable. They want to know whether to bet their money on the deal going through or falling apart. But the signals from Brussels have been very muddled. "Tracking it daily, with heart attacks," reports one arb. Another one was extremely interested in getting his hands on the commission's confidential report on GE-Honeywell. "I'm looking forward to seeing it more than any book or any movie," he confessed recently. And in the end, he says, he got a copy.

Some arbs or their lawyers display remarkable persistence. "Did you hear anything new?" one asks on the phone. In 10 minutes, he calls again: "Anything new?"

ON THE EVE of the Goteborg summit, the European Commission is picking a fight with Swedish authorities over local tariffs on wine.

The commission isn't happy that Sweden levies a higher tax on wine than it does beer. According to the commission, European law has firmly established that beer and wine ought to be taxed at the same level, since they are similar enough to compete for a place on the same dinner tables. Therefore, the taxing of one product more than the other could be a form of beer protectionism, the commission says. (Sweden, whose northern-most parts stretch well above the Arctic Circle, doesn't produce a lot of wine.)

The commission wrote to Sweden, pointing out the discrepancy and formally requesting that Stockholm lower the wine tariff. But the letter was only just mailed -- meaning it's too late for Sweden to change its policy in time for the protesters, journalists and government officials about to arrive in Goteborg for the summit. Or for U.S. President George W. Bush, but he's a teetotaler anyway.
---

TALKING POINTS: While Europe wondered what Bush would say on his maiden voyage to the Old World, planners in Warsaw agonized over where he'd say it. Initially, the list of possible venues for Mr. Bush's centerpiece speech Friday "was like a tour guide to Warsaw," says one person involved in the planning. Perhaps in front of the Royal Castle in the scenic old town? Nope -- too many comparisons with former President Bill Clinton, who spoke there to cheering crowds in 1997. The old town square, the new town square and the national theatre were also nixed. The Bush entourage ultimately chose the new Warsaw University Library, a funky, raw

concrete and glass edifice on Dobra (which means Good) Street. Why? "No idea," says the planner. "Maybe because his wife was a librarian?"

PHONE ATTACK: Telecoms Commissioner Erkki Liikanen is telling Parliament that the EU executive is getting impatient with local phone operators that refuse to open their networks to competition. If no improvement is seen by October, the commission will launch legal challenges to a number of operators, he says. While competition has taken off in local phone services, leased lines and the mobile market since European telecom liberalization began in 1998, most local networks are still monopolies. But not for want of competition. "We don't underestimate the ability of the incumbent operators to drag their feet as much as possible in order to postpone competition," Mr. Liikanen told Parliament's industry committee. The commission already has grounds to prosecute "in a number of cases," according to Mr. Liikanen, but is keeping its powder dry to give national regulators an opportunity to resolve disputes.

DAY IN COURT: The European Court of Justice will hold hearings next week on France's decision to maintain a ban on imports of beef from the U.K. even though the commission has deemed British beef safe in terms of
mad-cow disease. France -- which cited the advice of its food safety agency -- is the only country to persist in keeping British beef off its plates, and the commission cried foul.

Newscast:  Europe's  ability  to stop American  merger between two companies has chilling effect on mergers worldwide
506 words
14 June 2001
CNBC: Business Center
BCTR
English
(c) Copyright 2001, CNBC, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
SUE HERERA, co-anchor: About the situation involving  GE, Honeywell  and Europe, one thing is certain. It points the way towards a lot of other continental complications. The ability of European regulators to stop two American companies from merging is expected to have a chilling effect on mergers worldwide. And in other international dealings, it could have a bitter aftertaste. More from Rob Reynolds in Washington.
ROB REYNOLDS reporting:

How can two American companies have their merger plans blocked by foreign regulators on another continent, even after the US Justice Department has OK'd the deal? It's because companies the size of GE and Honeywell aren't just American companies anymore. They're global, and subject to global rules.

Mr. EDWARD GRAHAM (Institute for International Economics): Both of these firms have extensive European operations. And the European Union, under the modified treaty of Rome, does claim jurisdiction over mergers where the merging parties meet certain thresholds.

REYNOLDS: In the past, the European's Commission Competition Bureau has held up in closely scrutinized deals like AOL Time Warner and ExxonMobil. It forced Boeing and McDonnell Douglas to agree to conditions on their merger, and would have blocked the MCI WorldCom-Sprint deal if the FCC hadn't acted first.

Washington has reciprocal power to block European corporate combinations if they do significant business here. EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, a former professor of economics at an Italian university, has a reputation for playing hardball.

The collision over GE-Honeywell comes at a sensitive time in transatlantic relations. President Bush's policies are unpopular with many European leaders and much of the European public. During his European trip, the president has emphasized cooperation, and EU Commission president, Ramano Prodi, says trade tensions have diminished.

Mr. ROMANO PRODI (European Commission President): Somebody think that we work--we lose too much time on working on trade disputes. But it is not true. Now the real disputes are very, very small.

REYNOLDS: It is true that long-standing disputes over bananas and wheat products are resolved. But a conflict looms over steel, following Bush's action last week to protect US steel makers from cheaper imports. And Washington has been trying for years to break an EU ban on imports of hormone-treated American beef. Experts predict Europe's attitude towards competition and mergers will toughen in the future.

Mr. RICHARD BURT (Former Ambassador to Germany): And as the European Union begins to resemble almost kind of federal government--as--as the Germans say, they want to see a federal Europe--then regulatory disputes like this between Washington and Brussels, as opposed to old-fashioned disputes between Washington and national capitals, are going to proliferate.

REYNOLDS: And trade experts also point out that if Brussels continues to make it too difficult for American companies to do business in Europe, eventually Washington might decide to return the favor. Rob Reynolds, CNBC BUSINESS CENTER, Washington.

Newscast:  GE-Honeywell merger proposal runs afoul of Europeanregulators
565 words
14 June 2001
CNBC: Business Center
BCTR
English
(c) Copyright 2001, CNBC, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
TED DAVID, co-anchor: Our big story: that $41 billion acquisition of  Honeywell  by General Electric  appears tonight to be all but dead, even though it was  approved  by Washington. The proposal ran afoul of Europeanregulators. What's it mean to investors, and what happens next? Garrett Glaser is standing by at the GE Building in midtown Manhattan with some answers. Garrett.
GARRETT GLASER reporting:

Ted, if the big story was that this apparently humongous deal is going to go away, maybe the bigger story is what happens when European multinationals come over here to try to do more merger and acquisition deals themselves?

How it can be that the regulatory environment is so different across the pond? Over the last several years, chief regulator Mario Monti and others have blocked or required substantial modification in several big M&A deals, including MCI WorldCom-Sprint and Boeing-McDonnell Douglas. Are they anti-American? Not really, say antitrust attorneys in this country. It's just that they do business differently.

Mr. TOM KENAP (The Wall Street Journal): This is a--a longstanding tradition not only with Mr. Monti, but with his predecessor as well. They really want to seeing that competition is there in the marketplace, and as soon as they're concerned that this is not the case--and apparently they are in this thing here--they come down very hard.

GLASER: The effects of a merger are more closely scrutinized in Europe, say M&A attorneys who work there. One area studied closely is the potential for layoffs. Asked of the impact of a GE decision to walk away: minimal. One fund manager in New York said, `I don't see this as a negative. GE is regarded by many as one of the
best-positioned industrial giants.' Honeywell, on the other hand, faces a more uncertain future. Would it be worth as much going forward?

Mr. MATT COLLINS (Edward Jones): I think we'd probably see a lower premium just because of the problems Honeywell's had over the last couple of quarters. They had some very disappointing results. GE did come in and cr--really, potentially gutted the company and may have left it not quite as attractive for United Technologies.

GLASER: United Technologies, the company made a nearly accepted offer for Honeywell last fall. Will it try again, and it would make sense for UTX?

Mr. SAM PEARLSTEIN (First Union): They'd be a much broader aerospace supplier. With the acquisition of Sundstrand a couple of years ago, they already have a number of systems that would benefit from having the Honeywell businesses as well. In the environmental syste--environmental control systems, the auxiliary power unit systems, the--some of the smaller engines, certainly there's a lot of complementary products there. They'd
gain the avionics business that Honeywell has, which has electronics, who's taking on more and more importance in the play, and certainly would help benefit a lot of the other United Technologies systems.

GLASER: Well, UTX shares traded down on the session on some concerns about integration issue--issues, future profits, but also on concern that the stock would be shorted by arbitragers trying to get ahead of the game. Ted.
DAVID: All right, Garrett. Thanks very much, Garrett Glaser, in midtown tonight. Document bctr000020010710dx6e00049

RON INSANA, co-anchor: Jennifer Lewis-Hall joins us now from the exchange floor with BUSINESS CENTER's
Stock In Trade. Jennifer.
JENNIFER LEWIS-HALL reporting:

Yes. Hey, Ron. A very busy day. Broad-based selling we saw hit the Dow hard on that steep slide in shares of Honeywell. Now this is--GE and Honeywell's merger woes took center stage, but analysts also say taking a toll, more worries about corporate profits.

Mr. RICHARD McCABE (Merrill Lynch): I think the--the worry today is the fact that we're getting more and more of these unfavorable preannouncements of second-quarter earnings, particularly among some of the technology stocks. And the market again is--today is an example of it--reducing or relieving the overbought condition that we got to just two or three weeks ago.

So maybe today's performance combined with yesterday you're saying that, `Gee, that--the weakness is more visible, more obvious,' and that may be a sign we're near an ending.
LEWIS-HALL: Now a slew of sectors on the downside today. Among them, drawing selling, First Union cutting
2001 and 2002 estimates on financial services giant American Express, pressuring the financial sector. Charles
Schwab also issuing cautious comments today. So financials are turning lower. And a lot of red arrows in the
software sector. Shares of Micromuse plunging about 30 percent on cautious comments as well coming from the
company. A number of analysts downgrading the stock. So a very full news day today.

At 6:30, I'll have a look at Corning, why it dropped about 7 percent, and a top ketchup producer out with results. Much more to focus on, though, again today with General Electric really, Ron, in the spotlight, and Sue.

SUE HERERA, co-anchor: Well, eight months after  General Electric's  dramatic announcement that it would buy fellow Dow component  Honeywell,  the prospects for that deal are dimming. The deal is reportedly coming apart because GE's offer of $2.2 billion in divestitures is far less than  European regulators continue to demand. With a reference to his designated successor, chairman and CEO Jack Welch said in a statement earlier today that, quote, "Jeff Immelt and I wanted to complete the transaction, but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal," end quote.

GE's stock gained new--on the news today, or on the reception, perhaps, that the deal might not go through.

General Electric (GE) 49.00 up 1.15 [+2.43%]
HERERA: It finished up a buck 15 to 49 on extremely heavy volume. (Graphic on screen)
Honeywell (HON) 37.25 down 5.01 [-11.86%]

HERERA: As for Honeywell, the prospects of the deal falling apart took its toll there today, down $5.01--on a percentage basis, almost 12 percent--to 37.25. Ron.

Interview: Wall Street Journal's Thomas Knipp talks about the blocked  merger between GE and Honeywell
591 words
14 June 2001
CNBC: Business Center
BCTR
English
(c) Copyright 2001, CNBC, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
RON INSANA, co-anchor: In Europe, on Wall Street, and around the world, it is becoming clearer and clearer General Electric's  planned merger with Honeywell  is a deal in peril. And the prospect of  European officials blocking a merger between the two American companies throws a cloud over the global business community. Joining us now from London is Thomas Knipp. He's The Wall Street Journal's  Europe's associate editor.

And, Thomas, if you would explain the environment in which the problems arose for  European regulators here who had to deal with this ic--acquisition. What was the problem, in fact?

Mr. THOMAS KNIPP (The Wall Street Journal): I think the problem was, really, that GE had too big ambitions. And their main problem was that General Electric--Electric's avio--avionics services systems company, they intended, up to now, only to buy GE components. And their fear was that with Honeywell in the boat, they would tend to buy only Honeywell services and--and machines and tools as well. So their fear was that this would create a too uncompetitive kind of environment. And actually, the main thing they asked from GE was to change the commercial behavior of this entity. And apparently Jack Welch and Jeff Immelt were not prepared to
accommodate to that.

INSANA: Now are demands made by Mario Monti and the European regulators there a change from the way they usually deal with acquisitions like these?

Mr. KNIPP: Not at all. Not at all. It's--we discussed this on CNBC the whole afternoon. This is very much in the tradition of how the--ho--how the authorities here acted under Monti and under his predecessors. So there's no change in the policy here.

INSANA: All right. Now what does it mean if the deal is, in fact, blocked by the EU? Will it create a lot of problems for future transatlantic mergers?

Mr. KNIPP: I think what it will do--first and foremost it's--there will be a very big change in the relationship between regulators here in Europe and in the US. Up to now, there was a very close relationship. But with the change in administration in the US, all this changed. This is the first thing. The second thing is that, you know, given all the other tensions between the US and Europe, this could we--very well spark another kind of trade war or, you know, bigger--bigger tensions.

For GE itself, I think they would have a chance if they would withdraw the notification to approve this merger or to look at it, because if they do, they would have the chance to come back to the commission and refile, basically.
INSANA: All right.
Mr. KNIPP: If they don't do that, the thing will be declared dead basically by July the 12th.
INSANA: All right. Thomas Knipp of The Wall Street Journal Europe, thanks for joining us this evening. Mr. KNIPP: Goodbye now.
(Graphic on screen)
General Electric (GE) 48.80 up 0.95 [+1.99%]

INSANA: And taking a look at the two stocks in question today, General Electric, the parent of this network, actually rallied 95 cents to $48.80.
(Graphic on screen)
Honeywell (HON) 37.10 down 5.16 [-12.21%]

Page 137 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
INSANA: Honeywell, of course, lost considerable ground today, falling as much as $5 to $37.10, down more than
12 percent on the day.

Report on Business: The Wall Street Journal
GE calls up the big guns as EU merger talks falter Company faces a midnight deadline to save $41-billion
takeover of Honeywell

BRUSSELS, WASHINGTON and PITTSBURGH -- With a deadline for submitting new proposals looming, General Electric  Co. intensified its fight to win  European regulatory approval  to acquire Honeywell International Inc. and called on Washington to provide political support.

With GE's $41-billion (U.S.) bid for Honeywell  hanging in the balance, GE chairman and chief executive officer John F. Welch Jr. met with EuropeanCompetition Commissioner Mario Monti twice yesterday to work out a deal. But GE negotiators emerged from the second meeting discouraged, and the company's hopes of securing European approval  were dimming, said a person close to the situation. Though  GE is likely to present a final offer to the European Commission before a deadline of midnight tonight (Brussels time), and a compromise agreement is still possible, the company wasn't expecting the differences to be easily bridged.
The European Commission and GE spokespeople declined to comment on the negotiations.

A few days earlier, Mr. Welch called White House Chief of Staff Andy Card to ask for support. "It is a topic the administration may bring up in the meeting" with the European Union's leaders in Sweden tomorrow, said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for U.S. President George W. Bush.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick also weighed in, saying that the U.S. has a strong interest in seeing
the GE-Honeywell deal treated fairly. "Obviously, it's an important deal," Mr. Zoellick said at a news conference in
Brussels. "I've discussed it with my European colleagues," he said.
The U.S. Department of Justice has already approved the acquisition with minor concessions, but the European
Commission's Merger Task Force is demanding sweeping divestitures.

U.S. Attorney-General John Ashcroft earlier this week dispatched a senior Justice Department official to Brussels to talk with European counterparts about the transaction, U.S. officials said. Deborah Herman, a deputy assistant attorney-general in the antitrust division, met with European Commission officials to explain why the Justice Department concluded last month that the transaction was legal and could be approved with limited conditions, the officials said.

Along with the pressure from Washington, GE offered a bigger package of divestitures to satisfy European antitrust enforcers. GE's latest proposals seek to assuage the Commission's antitrust concerns on two fronts -- Honeywell's extensive range of avionics products and GE's own aircraft financing and leasing arm.

But it remained unclear whether the Commission would deem the offer sufficient because it has been pressing for even more-sweeping divestitures.
At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Honeywell shares were down $1.21 at $42.26, while
GE's shares were down 92 cents at $47.85.

The discussions between U.S. and European Union officials in part reflect Washington's increasing concern about a divergence of American and European antitrust policies after years of co-operation.

European Union Blocking GE-Honeywell Merger

Vol. 27, Issue: 12
English
(c) 2001 Phillips Business Information, Inc.
At least four companies -- Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney-Canada, Turbomecca, and Lufthansa AG -- have expressed interest in acquiring Honeywell's  military helicopter unit. However, it is still uncertain whether the proposed GE-Honeywell  merger will gain the approval  of the European Union. A decision must be made by July 12.

The U.S. Department of Justice  approved GE's $41 billion acquisition of  Honeywell  in May, provided the combined company exited the helicopter engine business.  GE agreed to this, but has met much greater intransigence from the  European Union.

The EU's overall concern is that the combined company will be too powerful in the aviation market, thus hindering competition and perhaps even driving some competitors out of business. The EU made more specific and pointed objections in a 155-page document that it provide to GE in May.

The Europeans are worried that GE-Honeywell will dominate the market for regional jet airplane engines and bundle or combine engine and avionics services. Regional jet corporate competitors such as Pratt & Whitney and Rolls Royce, and avionics competitors such as Thales, Litton Industries, and Rockwell Collins, all testified against the merger.

GE publicly has expressed optimism that the deal will gain EU approval. Privately, though, company officials acknowledge that they are frustrated by the protracted review process. The EU, they say, seems more intent on protecting companies -- especially in Europe -- from legitimate competition than in addressing bona fide antitrust concerns.

GENERAL ELECTRIC's chief executive, Jack Welch, met European regulators yesterday, a day before a deadline for meeting EU objections to the $41bn (#30bn) merger with Honeywell  International. No details were disclosed about the meeting, which took place amid reports that talks have been strained over  EU demands for significant divestitures in  Honeywell's  aerospace division. Under  EU rules, GE has until midnight today to make its final offer of concessions.

U.S. stocks  drop with Honeywell,  warnings.

NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Stocks slumped at midday on Thursday as the prospect of a failed  merger between heavyweights  General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Corp. rattled investors already on edge over corporate profit warnings.

The two companies, whose stocks are among the 30 in the Dow average, proposed divestitures worth $2.2 billion to win European Union approval  of their planned merger, but said they were not optimistic the proposal would
be accepted. At midday, a U.S. official said the EU appears to have decided against the  GE/Honeywell  deal.

Honeywell, whose products range from aircraft electronics to security systems, dropped 13 percent and accounted for more than a fifth of the blue-chip index's loss.

The news comes as Wall Street battles a bevy of profit warnings as the second quarter comes to a close. Companies ranging from ketchup giant H.J. Heinz Co. to electronic parts maker CTS Corp. warned results will land shy of Wall Street estimates in the economic downturn.
"We are in confessional season, and we have a poor economic outlook," said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst at
Prudential Securities. "We are going to have to go through the next two weeks blocking and tackling."
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average fell 161 points, or 1.49 percent, to 10,709. Industrial conglomerate
GE gained $2.32 to $50.17, while Honeywell sank $5.51 to $36.75.

The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 53 points, or 2.54 percent, to 2,067. Software maker Micromuse Inc. helped drive the tech-rich index lower with a drop of $8.70 to $26.55, adding to the stock's 16 percent plunge a day ago on fears it would not meet expectations.
The broad Standard & Poor's 500 Index slid 14 points, or 1.17 percent, to 1,227.
"It feels like an absence of buyers. I don't see any panic selling," said Ted Oberhaus, manager of equity trading at
Lord Abbett & Co. "I guess the feeling is the economic recovery is not imminent in the third or fourth quarter.
When you hear the European Central Bank is lowering growth forecasts and the Japanese economy is
deteriorating - that doesn't bode well over here in the states."

Confession season, when companies warn that profits will miss Wall Street estimates, picks up steam this week as the second quarter draws to a close.

So far this quarter, 65 percent of a total of about 743 profit forecasts have been negative, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. This time one year ago, about 50 percent of 173 earnings outlooks were warnings, the research firm said. This year's jump in negative forecasts is due in part to Reg FD, or Regulation Fair Disclosure, a rule forcing companies to disclose market-moving information even-handedly to all investors.

H.J Heinz lost 31 cents to $42.12, saying its core profits dropped 18 percent in its fiscal fourth quarter and warned that earnings in the current quarter would fall short of Wall Street estimates.

Fiber-optic cable maker Corning Inc. fell 94 cents to $16.41 after Wall Street house Merrill Lynch lowered its intermediate-term rating, saying sales may be weak over the next few quarters.

Texas Instruments Inc. fell $1.84 to $32.18. The semiconductor maker reiterated its financial outlook for the second quarter, saying revenues would fall 20 percent from the first quarter amid industry weakness.

Siebel Systems Inc. slid $4.35 to $40.75 after German software rival SAP AG unveiled big partnerships and high-profile deals with customers.

Kraft Foods Inc., the biggest U.S. food maker, dropped $1.21 to $30.04 one day after its market debut. Kraft fell below its initial public offering price of $31 per share.

CTS fell $3.90 to $20 after warning of a quarterly loss, following a restructuring that has included a work force reduction of 28 percent since the start of the year.
Investors shrugged off a report that showed U.S. inflation at the wholesale level was tame in May. The Producer
Price Index inched up 0.1 percent in May after rising 0.3 percent in April.

The government report offers reassuring news for Federal Reserve policymakers, who will meet later this month to consider whether to cut interest rates again. Wall Street, however, already widely expects the Fed will slice another 25 basis points off interest rates after five steep cuts totaling 250 basis points, or 2-1/2 percentage points, so far this year to lift the economy out of its slump.

"We are not seeing any great increase in inflationary pressure, but that is not what the market cares about." said Paul Cherney, market analyst at S&P Marketscope. "It cares about it only peripherally - it doesn't want it to impede Fed easing. What the market needs now is evidence that what the Fed has done is coming through in economic reports."

A separate report showed the four-week moving average of jobless claims rose to 424,500, adding to Wall Street's gray mood. That was the highest level in almost nine years and pointed to further weakening in the labor market as the world's richest economy struggles to climb out of its slowdown.

GE-Honeywell  seen exposing EU-US antitrust rift.
By Peter Kaplan

WASHINGTON, June 14 (Reuters) - The  European Union's tough stance on General Electric  Co.'s proposed purchase of Honeywell  International Corp. exposes a rift in U.S. and European antitrust enforcement despite years of effort to improve relations,  antitrust experts said on Thursday.

The GE-Honeywell  case is a jarring reminder that even though the two sides have improved collaboration on merger cases, the competition laws and agencies on each side of the Atlantic remain fundamentally different, U.S. antitrust experts said.

"We're in a broader world," sighed one prominent antitrust attorney in Washington, D.C. "We may think that (some of) their theories are crazy, but you'd better learn to deal with them."

The $42.3 billion GE-Honeywell merger gained relatively easy approval last month from the U.S. Department of Justice. The department's antitrust division required only that the companies divest a helicopter engine unit and give some engine maintenance work to a competitor.

But in Brussels on Thursday, the deal ran into serious trouble as the companies' last-ditch $2.2 billion divestiture offer fell far short of the European regulatory demands.
Underlying Europe's thinking is an antitrust theory known as the "portfolio effect" that has not been widely used by
U.S. antitrust officials since the 1980s.

Specifically, the Europeans fear that GE-Honeywell will be able to freeze out competitors by bundling together large packages of aerospace products.

GE's financing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, would exacerbate that problem by permitting it to offer bargain packages to airlines.
Europe and the United States haven't had such divergent views about a large merger since Boeing Co. bought
McDonnell Douglas in 1997.

When the EU threatened to turn down the Boeing merger, leading U.S. lawmakers promised a trade war that was averted when European competition officials finally relented.
That clash led to increased efforts to share merger investigation data and improve cooperation.
In the United States, antitrust enforcers are more likely to view the huge, "vertical" portfolio of products that
GE-Honeywell could offer as a benefit to customers, rather than a threat to competition, antitrust experts said.

"All this concern about bundling is something the American antitrust authorities - even the Clinton antitrust authorities - would look at as efficiencies," said Joe Simms, an antitrust attorney with Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Washington.

Since the 1980s, U.S. regulators have focused more on mergers that produce large "horizontal" shares of individual markets as the main threat to competition.
"Europe never bought on to that basic switch and never abandoned concerns with vertical issues the way the
U.S. did," said Steve Calkins, general counsel of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission during the mid-1990s.

Page 145 of 149 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
One reason Europe may be more aggressive about opposing mergers is because, unlike their U.S. counterparts, they don't have to go to court to stop a merger, according to some U.S. antitrust attorneys.

"The European Commission has more discretion, and it's harder to challenge them," Calkins said. "The existence of the courts have acted as a cloud in the back of the minds of U.S. enforcers."

The United States and the EU have sent antitrust delegations back and forth to discuss the GE/Honeywell case. But cooperation could not bring the two antitrust agencies to the same conclusion.

News of the tough EU demands caused immediate rumblings in Congress, where some lawmakers have accused the Europeans of treating U.S. companies more harshly than their own.
"There's has been a lot of growing suspicion on this side that the EU is playing games," said one source on
Capitol Hill. "This can't be a good sign for EU-U.S. relations."

Rivals of GE and Honeywell, such as United Technologies Corp. and Rockwell International Corp., have sent lobbyists to the Hill in recent days to try to quell any backlash against Europe, sources on the Hill said.

"They're saying, 'There are problems with this deal, there are problems with this deal. So if the Europeans block it, you should be happy," said one source in Congress.

UPDATE 2-GE, Honeywell  offer to divest $2.2 bln of business.

(Recasts first five paragraphs, updates stock prices, adds  European Competition Commissioner quotes in paragraphs 8-10)

NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Corp. on Thursday proposed massive divestitures to gain European Commission approval  for the companies' planned $42 billion  merger,
but they said the proposal fell far short of EC demands and they were not optimistic.

GE and Honeywell officials said in a prepared statement that the package submitted to the EC in Brussels, just hours before a midnight deadline there (6 p.m. EDT), included the divestiture of businesses with annual revenues totaling $2.2 billion. They said the EC was demanding "billions more."
The companies called their offer "final."

The news sent Honeywell shares plummeting on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares fell as low as $37 before recouping a bit to $38.99, off $3.27, or 7.7 percent. GE was up $1.55 to $49.40.
GE's acquisition of Honeywell has already been approved by U.S. antitrust officials.

GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch, in a statement, voiced dismay at the EC demands: "(GE Chairman-elect and President) Jeff Immelt and I wanted to complete the transaction, but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal. The commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point. This shows you are never too old to get surprised.

"In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined, and differed sharply from antitrust counterparts in the U.S. and Canada."

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the EC would continue to consider the GE-Honeywell deal unless it was formally withdrawn.

"Unless the merger notification is formally withdrawn, the Commission will continue with the review procedure," Monti said in a statement. He said he had had constructive and cordial talks with GE and Welch.

Monti said he was ready to consider new offers from the companies through the midnight deadline. And he said that "we regret" that GE failed to explore structural changes in its GE Capital Aviation Services, which buys, sells and leases airplanes.

GE and Honeywell said they had offered to divest several divisions within Honeywell's aerospace unit and set up GE Capital Aviation Services as a separate entity that would deal at arm's length with Honeywell's avionics and non-avionics products.

GE and Honeywell officials have been locked in feverish negotiations with European regulators in the last few weeks trying to broker a compromise that might allow their proposed union to go through.

GE has said the EC demands would cost it billions in revenue and significantly hinder the GE-Honeywell strategy for merging in the first place.

Among the divestitures proposed by GE and Honeywell, within Honeywell's aerospace business, were regional jet engines, air turbine starters, and certain avionics and non-avionics products.
