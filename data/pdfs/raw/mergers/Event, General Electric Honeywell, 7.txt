EU rejects GE-Honeywell merger;  wants to consult U.S. on future rulings

STRASBOURG, France (AP) - The  European Union rejected General Electric  Co.'s proposed dlrs 41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. on Tuesday and its antitrust chief suggested  EU and U.S.  regulators should work closer to prevent future mega-merger disagreements.

"GE-Honeywell  is a rare case where the trans-Atlantic  competition authorities have disagreed. I am determined to strengthen our bilateral cooperation in the future to try to reduce this risk further," said EUCompetition Commission Mario Monti.

The EU veto of a GE-Honeywell merger marked the first time a proposed merger between two U.S. companies was blocked solely by European regulators.
The measure was approved by regulators by the U.S. Department of Justice May 2.

Monti criticized political pressure on the EU to ensure the GE-Honeywell linkup received the go-ahead. And he spoke of "unprecedented" comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill questioning the EU executive Commission's authority to judge merger cases.

U.S. senators, in their turn, have accused EU regulators of protectionism. Before the EU veto was announced, President George W. Bush also expressed his concern.

Monti insisted the European veto was judged solely on its anticipated impact on fair competition, not political grounds.

"The nationality of companies was totally irrelevant for us," he told a news conference, pointing out that competitors that complained about the deal included both Americans and Europeans.

Under EU rules, the European Commission must approve mergers of companies whose combined worldwide turnover exceeds 5 billion euros (around dlrs 4.24 billion) and have European sales of at least 250 million euros (around dlrs 170 million).

Monti said U.S. and European regulators regularly consult on their respective investigations of corporate linkups. While the they usually come to similar verdicts, the "risk of dissenting views ... can never be totally excluded," he said.

Monti said he was "genuinely interested in understanding why" American regulators had made a different forecast of the impact of a GE-Honeywell merger.
He said it showed the need to "enhance cooperation in antitrust matters."

The companies' plans now were not immediately clear. GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again.

An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the Commission since 1990, six have been taken to court, but none as so far been successful. In three cases, he court sided with the Commission, one was withdrawn, and two are still pending.
In separate statements, GE and Honeywell expressed dismay at the EU veto of their merger plans.

Page 5 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," said
GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch.

The unanimous veto by the 20-member European Commission was expected after GE failed to allay European fears its merger plans would create an aerospace giant with unfair dominance in European markets.
Monti said the companies "vastly belated, highly publicized remedies did not resolve the problems identified." These focused on fears a GE-Honeywell linkup would have lead to a dominant share of the market for corporate
jet engines, cockpit electronics as well as jet engines for large commercial and regional jets.

Additionally, the EU argued that through its aircraft-financing and leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, GE could force the price of planes up. It rejected GE's offer to sell a minority stake in GECAS arguing it didn't change the structure of its control of GECAS' purchasing policy.
General Electric Co. is one of the world's largest and most profitable companies. It makes power plant parts,
plane engines, appliances and owns the NBC television network. Honeywell makes aerospace, power generation,
transportation and factory automation systems, as well as specialty chemicals, plastics, fibers and other industrial
materials.
GE said on Oct. 23 it would buy Honeywell for more than dlrs 40 billion in stock.
On March 1, the EU launched an in-depth probe into the linkup and issued a formal statement of objections on
May 8, six days after the proposed merger was approved by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Last month GE chief executive Jack Welch flew to Brussels to try to win EU approval for the merger, but said that the Europeans were making "extraordinary demands" for antitrust clearance.

Newscast:  European Commission officially blocks  GE-Honeywell merger

DAVID BRANCACCIO, anchor: First it was the signals, then the sources, say stories, out of the European Commission, General Electric  and Honeywell.  Today what had been foreshadowed became official. Europe has blocked a merger between the two industrial and aerospace giants. It is the first time European antitrust officials have stopped a  merger between two US-based companies that the American government had already approved.

In a statement today,  GE CEO Jack Welch said he felt, quote, "profound regret" at this setback, a word choice that leaves open the possibility of a legal challenge to  Europe's decision. The thwarted  merger is seen as a personal setback for Welch, who had stayed on as CEO to see the deal through.

The long knives appear to be out for Honeywell CEO Michael Bonsignore, with a Wall Street Journal article today suggesting Honeywell's board was looking for a replacement.

TODAY'S BRIEFING

-- The European Union's 20-member executive  Commission plans to vote today on  General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last minute proposals or withdrawal of the  merger, EU officials said Monday. The  EU is widely expected to  reject the deal at its meeting in Strasbourg, France.

-- Ford Motor Co. has hired the former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as a consultant. Sue Bailey was hired a few weeks ago as an internal consultant, Ford spokesman Jason Vines said Monday. Vines emphasized that Bailey has "nothing to do with the Explorer. She's here to help out with the tire
replacement program and with this public health issue." Last August, 6.5 million Firestone tires, used mainly as original equipment on Explorers, were recalled when the federal government linked at least 203 deaths and more than 700 injuries to the tires. In some cases Explorers rolled over after the tires experienced tread separation.

-- Quaker Oats Co. has given PepsiCo Inc. an extra 30 days to divest its All Sport sports-drink brand in an effort to win U.S. approval for the No. 2 soft-drink company's purchase of the Gatorade maker. Quaker Oats cited "continuing discussions" with the Federal Trade Commission as the reason for the extension. FTC lawyers are concerned about PepsiCo's acquisition of Gatorade, which holds more than 80 percent of the U.S. sports-drink market.

-- OPEC ministers indicated the group is unlikely to raise oil production at a meeting today. OPEC ministers are watching crude oil inventories that are up more than 7 percent in the past year in the United States, the world's
top oil consumer. In response, prices in London have fallen about 11 percent since June 14. "The market is weak, inventories are high and demand is weakening," Chakib Khelil, Algerian oil minister and OPEC president, said in Vienna. "We are worried about a collapse in prices."

-- International Business Machines Corp.'s pension fund sold Boston's One Federal Street office tower for $375 million. The 1.1 million-square-foot building was sold to Jamestown Associates, a real estate fund for German investors, said Mike MacMillan, a spokesman for Clarion Partners, IBM's adviser and partner.

-- An index of U.S. manufacturing in June rose to a seven-month high and consumer spending increased more than expected in May, both signs the economy may be starting to recover from its factory-led slowdown. The National Association of Purchasing Management's index increased to 44.7 last month from 42.1 in May. Last month's reading, the highest since November, was boosted by gains in orders and production. Still, a reading below 50 signals a decline, and the index has been in the 40s since August.

-- Beauty giant Revlon Inc. is selling Colorama brand of cosmetics and hair products, sold primarily in Brazil, as well as Revlon's manufacturing facility in Sao Paulo to the L'Oreal Group for $55 million.

The Dow Jones industrial average Tuesday fell 22.61 points to 10,571.11 while the Nasdaq slipped 7.92 to
2,140.80. European Union regulators voted today to block the  merger of General Electric  and Honeywell,  the
first time that E.U. regulators have acted alone in blocking a deal between American companies.

LOU DOBBS, CNN ANCHOR: Tonight, a crushing blow to Jack Welch and  Honeywell,  but an opportunity for George David and United Technologies and the potential for a transatlantic trade war. We'll have a report from the OPEC meeting in Vienna and have the latest forecast on summer gasoline prices. And the man who brought you the thriller in Manila, the rumble in the jungle, joins us to talk about the great brawl of China, Don King.
ANNOUNCER: From the heart of New York City, this is LOU DOBBS' MONEY LINE. Here now, Lou Dobbs. DOBBS: Good evening. GE-Honeywell, the biggest deal of Jack Welch's career, is officially dead. The European
Commission this morning voted to block the takeover, the first time that the E.U. regulators have acted alone in
blocking a deal between American companies. And we are right now awaiting an announcement from
Honeywell's board, apparently on the fate of CEO Michael Bonsignore. It is a stunning turn of events for a saga
that had already set a new benchmark in corporate intrigue.
We begin our coverage tonight with Allan Chernoff. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After weeks of failed negotiations with GE and Honeywell executives, the suspense was all but gone as European competition commissioner Mario Monti announced the decision.

MARIO MONTI, EUROPEAN COMPETITION COMMISSION: This merger, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines.

CHERNOFF: Market dominance was the problem the Europeans saw, GE in jet engines, Honeywell in avionics. Combined, the European Commission argued, the businesses could have even more clout if GE's aircraft division, which leases to major airlines, pressured suppliers to favor Honeywell avionics and GE engines. GE's response, "We strongly disagree. The facts just don't support these assertions." Honeywell said it is deeply disappointed.

Announced last October, the mega merger sailed through the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division with relatively minor modifications. Commissioner Monti denied the European rejection was part of a political agenda.

MONTI: This does not mean that one authority is doing a technical analysis and the other is pursuing a political goal, but simply that we might interpret facts differently. I am determined to strengthen our bilateral cooperation in the future.

CHERNOFF: But if anything, the rejection of GE and Honeywell's plans is raising concerns that Europeans might block future mergers between U.S. corporations.

MICHAEL REGAN, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: I think it is a dangerous precedent set by the Europeans to sort of put their heads in the sand and withdraw a little bit from the nature of global competition on the world stage.

Page 9 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CHERNOFF (on camera): In the aftermath of this affair, the thinking in the business world is that GE walks away remaining one of the most potent companies on the globe. Honeywell, though, emerges bruised. Moody's Investors Service acknowledges that, saying it is now considering lowering the company's bond rating -- Lou?

DOBBS: Yet we saw the stock of GE today decline, something of a surprising development, even though it was light trading. How impaired is GE as a result of this? Jack Welch certainly taking a hit. How about GE?

CHERNOFF: Taking a bit of a hit in his reputation but everybody is saying Jack still certainly has a fantastic career and GE still a very strong company, solid earnings continuing in spite of the economic slowdown, people saying the company is going to keep moving ahead.
DOBBS: Although this would have been a major, as the saying goes, accretive boost to GE as a result. CHERNOFF: No doubt about it and a lot of disappointment there.
DOBBS: Right. Allan, thank you, as always.

Well, as await word from Honeywell's board on the fate, perhaps, of Michael Bonsignore, the CEO, Peter Viles is here to tell us what is probably next for this company -- Pete?

PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's been very difficult to predict what is next in any of this drama. But two big questions hanging over this company -- who's going to run it? Will it be Michael Bonsignore or perhaps Larry Bossidy? And just as big a question for investors, is it still for sale? And if it is for sale, is it for sale in one piece, perhaps to United Technologies, or will they try to avoid the Europe Commission and Mario Monti and perhaps sell it off piecemeal? There was a lot of discussion on Wall Street today that perhaps that is the way to go, to break this company up and sell it piece by piece. DOBBS: "The Wall Street journal" reporting particularly that Larry Bossidy, the former head of Allied Signal, who orchestrated that combination coming back, that looks like pretty much a clear signal, a very overt signal, perhaps, that Mr. Bossidy might be already set to move in, correct?

VILES: It certainly does, although you would think a company ready to make an announcement like that would have made it by this time on a holiday evening. So you would assume there is some substantive discussions right now in that boardroom. And as we say, the twists and turns of this story, it's very hard to say what's next.

DOBBS: United Technologies certainly wanted not to be next, but wanted to be first in this combination. They, with the vigor and the effort they put into derailing the GE-Honeywell deal, it seems fair to assume that they have a significant interest in moving ahead with Honeywell.

VILES: Sure. The question there is do they want the whole thing or having seen what happened in Europe, perhaps they think that might be difficult for them and they would come back, perhaps, with a different offer, a lower offer, and Larry Bossidy or Michael Bonsignore or somebody else is going to have to decide is it worth less now than it was in October? So a lot of drama left in this story.

DOBBS: And as you say, on a pre-holiday eve, I don't know if pre-holiday eve would be quite the way to -- it would be a holiday eve, not a pre-holiday eve. It seems unusual that that board is meeting and taking this long. We had expected that phone call, that conference call to be at what time?
VILES: There had been some guidance we would have news from the company by 5:30. DOBBS: 5:30.
VILES: But if you remember back to October, the way this thing all happened then did not reflect or respect a business timetable at all. Even that was an 11th hour weekend deal. So...
DOBBS: Nothing has gone according to script on this one. VILES: Not at all.
DOBBS: Pete, thanks very much. Peter Viles.

Well, on Wall Street today, investors were focused more on profit warnings than the GE-Honeywell debacle. Or, perhaps, the real focus, in fact, was the Fourth of July holiday. The markets today drifted lower in a short
pre-holiday session. Jennifer Westhoven has the story.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JENNIFER WESTHOVEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A round of profit warnings set a down beat tone for the day. Most of the disappointments came from Internet and software companies, raising worries there's no quick comeback in sight for those sectors. Internet Security Systems sank 40 percent on a warning it will lose even more money this quarter. Other high tech firms had some nasty surprises, as well.

PETER DOYLE, KINETICS NEW PARADIGM FUND: These companies are selling a product that hits a wall, the demand falls off very dramatically and it may not come back ever and I think that the valuations for many of the technology names are very extended and are likely to come down.

WESTHOVEN: The selling overall was modest, though. The Nasdaq slipped 7 to 2,140 for the day. Volume was light with the closing bell ringing three hours early a day before the Independence Day holiday.

A similar story for Dow Jones Industrial Average, closing out the day down 22 at 10,571. DuPont was the Dow's top percentage loser after it said Q2 profits won't meet forecasts. The chemical giant also said demand is weak, not just in the United States, but around the world.

RICHARD CRIPPS, LEGG MASON: After the bear market has bottomed, which we think it did at the beginning of April, typically earnings are very difficult, meaning your comparisons with a year ago are very hard and there's really no momentum in the economy yet to cause earnings to increase.

WESTHOVEN: DuPont fell, as did IBM and US Airways, which fell nearly 12 percent, its second day of losses after it said it won't get a $4.3 billion buyout from UAL. Bucking the trend, casket maker Hillenbrand gained on stronger than expected profits.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

WESTHOVEN: One big question is if the potential weakness of the third quarter profits is already priced into the stock market. In about two weeks, earning period starts and with it a blitz of conference calls and corporate forecasts. And many analysts say the long awaited visibility is coming, but it's not going to be pretty --Lou?

DOBBS: Well, if it's, the visibility is so difficult, maybe they don't know for certain. Let's be optimists here. Think about it being a bright sunny day. And the earning season does get underway and with already the confession season now behind us, this, it looks like it's going to be an intriguing third quarter. We can say it that way, at least.

WESTHOVEN: There are a lot of analysts, too, including First Call, who say they really think that the estimates for that third quarter for the growth, they are really going to have to come down and come down hard.
DOBBS: OK, Jennifer. We'll see. As always, Jennifer Westhoven, thanks.

In economic news, the second encouraging report on manufacturing -- see -- in as many days, factory orders jumping two and a half percent in May. That was far stronger than expected and the best monthly performance in nearly a year. But there was also some encouragement from auto workers, auto makers, rather, today. Ford sales in June fell sharply, but the company reported that sales of the Explorer hit a record despite all of that bad P.R. and safety concerns. Chrysler posting its first positive month of sales since last fall. And General Motors' results falling short of expectations, but sales of its SUVs and minivans surged.

Ahead here on MONEY LINE, the great brawl of China. It could only come from the mind of Don King. I'll be talking with the legendary boxing promoter about his upcoming bout in Beijing. And, a deal between U.S. companies actually approved by the U.S. government killed by European regulators. We'll talk about the prospects of U.S. retaliation, the potential of a trade war with Europe.
ANNOUNCER: Coming up, Lou speaks with former Defense Secretary William Cohen. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
DOBBS: The European decision to block the GE-Honeywell deal captured attention certainly not just on Wall
Street. It has also turned heads on Capitol Hill as well. Tim O'Brien reports from Washington.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

TIM O'BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Washington reaction to the rejection of the GE-Honeywell deal is mixed depending on where one sits. In Congress sentiment to retaliate.

Page 11 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SEN. ROBERT TORRICELLI (D), NEW JERSEY: If this was to happen to a company based in New Jersey, as Honeywell is with many of its operations and General Electric in our neighbor of Connecticut, I will tell you, we are lying in wait.
O'BRIEN: But the most vociferous opponent of the deal wasn't in Europe, it was in Connecticut by United
Technologies, who also has expressed interest in acquiring Honeywell.

EDWARD GRAHAM, INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS: To the extent that the European Commission was acting on behalf of competing firms, it was another U.S. firm. So New Jersey might be lying in wait, but at this point Connecticut would be applauding.

O'BRIEN: The United States and Europe disagree on many issues, from nuclear weapons to genetically modified foods. Trade and reconciling anti-trust differences, however, have been areas of cooperation, until now.

GRAHAM: And I think it would be a very serious error at this point to take this one case and to use this as a basis for derailing what has been quite a constructive process.

O'BRIEN: While critics accuse the Europeans of protectionism, others attribute the rejection to a failure to communicate, aggravated by the change in administrations in the U.S. last January.

PAULA STERN, THE STERN GROUP: We really didn't have anyone sitting in the chair at Justice overseeing the harmonization and coordination that is very helpful in avoiding misunderstandings like this one.

O'BRIEN: Late today, administration officials said the GE-Honeywell merger would be have pro-competitive and the E.U.'s rejection reflects a significant point of divergence with the U.S. on antitrust policy.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

O'BRIEN: Still, many international trade experts say any kind of retaliation would likely be counterproductive, placing in jeopardy a relationship that brings the United States some $165 billion in export earnings every year -- Lou?
DOBBS: Tim, thank you, very much. Tim O'Brien from Washington.
And for more now on the potential tension with Europe over trade and regulation, we are joined by former
Defense Secretary William Cohen, also the head of The Cohen Group. Good to have you with us, Bill.
WILLIAM COHEN, THE COHEN GROUP, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY: Lou, good to be here again. DOBBS: The, you're no stranger to a certain amount of rhetoric in Washington, D.C., but this seems a little more
strident, perhaps a little more voluble than usual.

COHEN: It's a little more voluble because of the prestige and size and influence of GE itself as well as Honeywell and the way in which it was handled, because the United States did approve it and the U.S. is not usually in favor of approving mergers that are going to be anti-competitive and cost more to the consumers. So there's some pretty strong feelings here. I think right now we will see a waiting period to determine whether this was a full Monty, so to speak, or half Nelson being applied by the Europeans. And I would think that as time moves on and we see whether there are other suitors for Honeywell, whether it's United Technologies or others, whether that were to go through or be blocked by the E.U., that would have a major impact if they were then to raise another objection and block a future merger. I think they've got one here. A second one would be pretty catastrophic, I think.
DOBBS: No two strikes, in other words? COHEN: No two strikes.
DOBBS: All right, let's turn to another development, that is the United Nations making it very clear to Secretary Powell that there would not be smart sanctions against Iraq, clearly a victory for Iraq and the oil for food program. Your reaction?

COHEN: It's clearly a defeat for the United Nations. Here we have Saddam Hussein, who has poked one finger in one eye of the United Nations by saying the inspectors are out. Now he's stuck another finger in the eye by
saying take the sanctions off. And the U.N. basically trying to accommodate him.


Page 12 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
We have a situation in which Saddam was able to say free me from sanctions before I kill again, and that means he's killing hundreds, if not thousands, of his own people by depriving them of medicines, clothing, other types of humanitarian assistance. So he is doing this and unfortunately it's bringing discredit to the U.N., not credit.
DOBBS: And at this juncture, what can the United States, what can the Bush administration do about it? COHEN: I think we continue to point out that the U.N. has its credibility on the line. They cannot in the future
expect anyone to have any kind of faith and confidence in U.N. resolutions if the U.N. itself is unwilling to enforce
them. So I think we have to continue to raise high the roof beam as far as our voice and what the U.N. is doing in
this case.

DOBBS: And Robert Hanssen to enter a plea of guilty this Friday. A lot of discussion about that. It appears that definitely a plea bargain arrangement has been arrived at. Do you think it's the right course?

COHEN: Well, if, in fact, he has agreed to fully cooperate and disclose everything that he is alleged to have given up to the Russians, that would be in our overall interests to find out exactly how much has been compromised, where, when and what countermeasures that have been taken and what we have to do to correct it. So under those circumstances, it's probably in the best interests of the United States to arrive at that kind of a plea agreement, if it goes through.

DOBBS: And to avoid the death penalty here for what is the most severe case of treason certainly in modern history?

COHEN: If he, in fact, did what is alleged to have occurred, that he alleged to have committed, he certainly cost the lives of a number of people and putting our lives in jeopardy. This is a very serious case and probably the most serious that we've seen in a long, long time. Nonetheless, it's important to our national security interests to find out exactly how much damage has been done, when it was done and what measures have been taken to actually counter our efforts. That's very important to future security of our country as well.
DOBBS: Bill, thank you very much for being with us. COHEN: Glad to be here.
DOBBS: Happy Fourth of July. COHEN: Same to you. DOBBS: Bill Cohen.
Coming up next here, we're back to square one. Microsoft's latest product could take it back on a collision course with those trust busters. And later, a medical breakthrough in the fight to conquers the nation's biggest killer.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

DOBBS: Microsoft's anti-trust headaches are far from over despite last week's big victory in the Court of Appeals. While the immediate threat of a breakup is ended, Microsoft faces a tough test just as it rolls out some of its newest products. Steve Young has our report.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The states that filed an antitrust suit are increasingly concerned about Microsoft's forthcoming Windows XP and its .net strategy to dominate the Internet. And they've received powerful ammunition from the Court of Appeals which last week, in effect, reversed itself. Previously it had said the company could bundle anything into Windows, no matter what the impact on competitors, if there is some "plausible consumer benefit." Now, when a new judge is assigned to the case, he'll have to use a tougher test because the Court of Appeals said its own "plausible benefit" standard was inconsistent with antitrust law.

KEVIN ARQUIT, CLIFFORD CHANCE ROGERS & WELLS: Courts do have to be willing to look into software design to resolve antitrust questions. And the court said instead you have to do a balancing test. You have to look what the benefit to Microsoft is of blending the two together versus the loss to consumers that they no longer
have the choice they otherwise would have.

HARVEY SAFERSTEIN, MINTZ, LEVIN: It sets the bar quite high for Microsoft to show that when it integrates something it must be able to justify why and how it's doing that, especially if the government, which it has, alleges that that integration is improper.

Page 13 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
YOUNG: Microsoft rejoiced in the reversal, at least for now, of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's breakup order and his rebuke and removal by the Court of Appeals. But those same conservative judges, seven to nothing, agreed with Judge Jackson that Microsoft had monopoly power and abused it. They said Microsoft broke the law in its dealings with Intel, Apple, Sun, with Internet access providers, PC manufacturers and other software companies. Instead of winning customers on the merits of its products, the judges said in some instances Microsoft used technological tricks to thwart competitors. A breakup remains Microsoft's biggest fear.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

YOUNG: But antitrust lawyers say the Court of Appeals decision could usher in some sort of software watchdog office. The company has called that a bureau of Microsoft which ranks right up there with nightmare number one
-- Lou?
DOBBS: Nightmare No. 1 being the breakup? YOUNG: Right.
DOBBS: I think you'd probably get them to make an even trade on that. At this point we're still left with a basic issue, the court proceedings moving so much more slowly than technology is advancing and the competitive nature of the marketplace.

YOUNG: Which is why the states were saying you should divide the company, because otherwise you would slow down Microsoft with this watchdog thing.
DOBBS: Well, perhaps speeding up the courts wouldn't be a bad idea. What do you think? YOUNG: This has moved faster than most antitrust cases.
DOBBS: And why aren't we all just warm and fuzzy about that? Steve, thanks very much, Steve Young.

Coming up next, it's the size of a grapefruit, meant to replace an ailing heart. We'll be telling you about a medical breakthrough in Kentucky. Also, the big loser in today's merger, General Electric, as training ground for corporate America.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
DOBBS: A medical breakthrough making news tonight. Doctors in Louisville, Kentucky have inserted the first
self-contained artificial heart. Officials at Jewish Hospital, where the seven hour procedure took place yesterday,
said the patient is awake and responsive today. The artificial heart is the first completely implanted artificial heart
that totally replaces the function of the human heart. The grapefruit sized device is made of titanium and plastic. It
is powered by an internal battery that is continually recharged by an external battery pack. The heart is
manufactured by the medical device company Abiomed, which gained more than $3 a share today.

A disaster in the skies to report today. A Russian passenger plane crashed and burst into flames in Siberia, killing all 143 people on board. That plane went down about 21 miles from the Siberian city of Irkutsk, Russian government officials saying none of the 133 passengers and 10 crew members survived the crash.

Another flight to report today, closing out a tense period in U.S.-China relations. The final pieces of that EP3 spy plane that collided with a Chinese jet fighter several months ago left China. The pieces loaded onto a cargo plane that headed for Hawaii after a stopover in the Philippines. The aircraft will be reassembled in Georgia and will be returned, we're told, to service. U.S. officials had hoped to repair the EP3 in China, but Beijing would not allow it
to be flown out of China. Coming up in the next half hour, all of the details from a shortened day on Wall Street. Also, OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna. We'll have the results for you and a live report from Vienna. And a boxing promoter made in America takes his worldwide, world class act to China. Don King on the title bout known as Ragin' In Beijing or simply The Great Brawl of China.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
DOBBS: In tonight's MONEYLINE headlines, the European Union officially rejects the GE-Honeywell deal, and
Honeywell board, meeting to discuss the future leadership of the company.

Several earnings warnings hitting Wall Street today, despite a shortened session. Those earnings warnings, along with the GE- Honeywell deal, pushing markets lower on the day.

Page 14 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And no surprises from OPEC today as its members agree to maintain current limits on oil production.

The Dow and the Nasdaq finished lower on a shortened trading session ahead of tomorrow's July 4th holiday. Impacting trading, several profit warnings, plus the E.U. rejection of the Honeywell-GE deal. The Dow spent most of the day in the red, weighed down by Dupont, IBM, Philip Morris -- the index losing 22 points. Pressuring the Nasdaq today, those tech warnings, particularly from the software sector, and the index down eight points on the big board, advancing issues, beating out decliners by only a very slim margin.

Pre-holiday winners on the Nasdaq today included Qualcomm. It jumped more than $6 a share. It's expanding a cross-licensing agreement with Nokia. Nokia will pay royalties to Qualcomm for its third generation digital technology. Multex.com stock today cut in half. The investment research Web site warning sales will fall short of targets because of a slowdown in spending on technology and investor products.

And I-Many, falling more than 30 percent today, the company only one of many Internet software companies to issue profit warnings for this quarter. I-Many stock losing more than 2/3 of its value over the past 52 weeks.

And a quick correction: last night we took a look at Erik Gustafson's stock picks. One of the graphs incorrectly titled "Bed, Bath and Beyond." It should have read Best Buy. Best Buy stock has climbed 53 percent since Gustafson first reported it here on MONEYLINE.

Well, my next guest predicts a summer rally on the way, despite today's negative session on Wall Street. Joining me now, Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Dick, good to have you with us.
RICHARD MCCABE, MERRILL LYNCH: Thank you, Lou. DOBBS: Let's get that rally going.
MCCABE: Any day now. Fireworks might start before July 4th is over. DOBBS: How profound a rally do you see?
MCCABE: Well, I see a pretty good rally this summer. I think what we're looking at is a two-stage spring-summer rally. We had a pretty good bounce off the early March, early April lows during May and into the early part of
June. There's been a pullback since the beginning of June, and I think now we're going to get a second step up in
July-August.
DOBBS: ... interrupt you. We have received word that the Honeywell board of directors has just elected Larry
Bossidy chairman and CEO of Honeywell, the former CEO, Michael Bonsignore, on the heels of that failed
GE-Honeywell deal blocked officially today by the E.U. Michael Bonsignore is out. Larry Bossidy returning to the
company as CEO and chairman of Honeywell.
Dick -- we'll be bringing you more details as they're available.
Dick, I want to apologize for the interruption, but our viewers needed to know that right away. MCCABE: Sure.
DOBBS: In terms of a two stage rally, and in terms of what's going to drive this market, what particulars do you see as influencing the market higher?

MCCABE: Well, I think one thing might be the anticipation, as we go through the summer, that the Fed easing -- the six steps toward easing in the past six months will finally work. And if people look ahead, we tend to get the market to anticipate such things. If we get to the fall and we get some good news that the easing has started to have an impact on the economy, the advance may be over. So very often in the market, anticipation is better than the realization of the fact, and that may be the driving force behind a summer bounce.

DOBBS: What do you say to those people, Dick, though, who say, yes, we've had six rate cuts in six months -- actually, it was just under six months -- yes, we have $40 billion in tax cuts moving back into the private sector, but this really isn't a consumer-led slowdown. It's a reduction in business investment, capital spending. It is a, if you will, a CEO slowdown: contracting spending.



Page 15 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCCABE: That's it. I think it probably represents a situation where the capital good stocks will have a limited rally, particularly the technology aspect of capital goods, where the overspending, the overcapacity, the oversupply actually exists. But I think that the Fed easing could have an impact on the consumer side, and that might be where the recovery picks up, so some of the consumer cyclical stocks might do very well.

DOBBS: So that's where you're looking for the real drive? MCCABE: I think that's it. A lot of the basic industries, like chemicals, a lot of the consumer cyclicals, like lodging and home furnishings and even some of the energy stocks that have come down a lot in the last month or two might be good rebound candidates in the summer.

DOBBS: So give us a sense of it, proportionately, what you think we're going to see, in the way of a move -- higher here in point terms or percentage terms, for both the Nasdaq and the Dow.

MCCABE: Well, I think on the Dow, which has been the strongest of the major averages over the past six months to a year, it's not far below its all-time high, which was about 11,700, that was set back in January of last year. That, I think, could get up to the old high or maybe even slightly surpass it. So my guess is 11,500 to 12,000 for the Dow. The Nasdaq, I think it could get up to around 2,600 to 2,800.
DOBBS: OK. I think everybody would sign up for that. MCCABE: It would be a nice move.
DOBBS: Absolutely. Dick, thanks very much. MCCABE: Thank you for having me.
DOBBS: Have a nice 4th.

Coming up on MONEYLINE: OPEC choosing the status quo on oil production. We'll be going live to Vienna for the details.

And it's considered one of the top corporate training grounds. It is General Electric and the parade of executives who've spread their skills across corporate America, is truly impressive.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

DOBBS: In tonight's "Powering America," the state of California able to lift a blackout warning after neighboring states stepped up and provided additional power to California. Earlier today, state officials had warned blackouts would be necessary to prevent collapsing the power grid. Soaring temperatures throughout the Southwest prompted heavy air condition demand and strained supplies.

In other power related news, Pacific Gas Electric asked a U.S. bankruptcy court judge to grant the company several addition months to file a reorganization plan. PG&E filed for protection from creditors back in April.

OPEC ministers today agreed to leave oil production unchanged, keeping the previous supply restrictions in place. The reason, an expected resumption of Iraq's export of crude oil, supervised by the United Nations.

For the details we go now to Vienna, where Charles Hodson is standing by live -- Charles? CHARLES HODSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lou, as expected, the ministers more or less just held the line here. Their decision to keep their production steady at 24.2 million barrels a day was exactly what everyone was expected. They even announced, strangely enough, their final decision before even starting their formal session. The reason, according to the meeting's presidents, they all read recent weak oil prices the same way.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CHALIB KHELIL, OPEC PRESIDENT: There was a complete consensus on not increasing production at this stage.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

HODSON: But that might change. Iraq is poised, as you mentioned, Lou, to return to pumping the 2.1 million barrels a day that it is allowed to pump to export under the U.N.'s "Food for Oil" program. A month ago, of course, Iraq had withdrawn that right in order to protest the proposals from the United States and Britain to rework the sanctions, the sanctions regime that the United Nations imposes on Baghdad.


Page 16 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But those proposals are now off the table at the Security Council. But OPEC can take Baghdad's move in pretty much in stride, particularly as demand is likely to pick up now. We're heading towards the fall, and of course, the winter, so prices will likely rise again in the months ahead.
But at least one veteran OPEC watcher says the cartel had better not overplay its hand for too long. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MEHDI VARZI, DRESDNER KLEINWORT WASSERSTEIN: Fundamentally, they are defending prices at too high a level. They can carry on doing this through micromanagement, but at some stage, they will face a critical test. And in my view, it is not a question of if they are going to face it, it's a question of when they are going to face it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

HODSON: If the world economy heads further south and if OPEC is seen to being to blame for that, Lou, then test may come pretty soon.
Over to you, Lou.
DOBBS: Charles, thank you very much. Charles Hodson, live from Vienna. Thank you very much, Charles.

In other corporate news, Apple computer says it will end production of its G4 cube. The PC failed to catch on as Apple had anticipated, despite upgrading the unit. Apple says customers tended to buy its power mac G4 unit instead.

The world's largest bowling alley operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. AMF Bowling Worldwide intends to restructure with the help of $75 million in financing it received from lenders. The company says it intends to keep its 500 bowling alleys open.

More now on GE-Honeywell. Just moments ago, Honeywell announcing it had replaced CEO Michael Bonsignore with former Allied Signal CEO Larry Bossidy. Bossidy is one of many top executives to emerge from GE's vast pool of talent. The company skilled so many skilled executives, there's now a global network of GE graduates.
Alan Dodds Frank has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ALAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Corporate recruiters see General Electric as the biggest business school in the world. Executives there are taught from the top down by CEO Jack Welch and the GE Management School.

They are so highly prized they have become CEOs at dozens of other huge companies. Larry Bossidy, the once and possibly future CEO of Honeywell, is a General Electric veteran.
And when Jeffrey Immelt was picked to succeed Welch, the other two top contenders immediately landed CEO
jobs.

Robert Nardelli runs Home Depot, and James McNerney now runs 3M. The corporate headhunter who placed those three says GE training produces executives with portable skills.

GERRY ROCHE, HEIDRICK & STRUGGLES: Management succession. Management talent is transferable. And GE has proven that. They have proven that by cross-pollinating within their divisions. They have 6 major sectors. Core businesses. They just move one from jet engines to lighting to appliances to GE Capital. Doesn't matter. If you can run something and you know management skills, you can run anything.
FRANK: Companies needing a turnaround look for GE talent.
Gary Wendt left GE Capital to run Conseco. Paolo Fresco has taken charge at Fiat. And David Cote now runs
TRW.

NOEL TICHY, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: One of the hallmarks of GE managers is their toughness at making yes, no decisions. Not setting up committees or bureaucracies, but are able to face realities, make a yes, no decision, and move on about investments, products and people.


Page 17 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FRANK: During his two decades as CEO, Welch says he has spent 51 percent of his time picking, training, and managing people. And he is proud the talent has spread worldwide.

(on camera): That management view is expected to continue under Immelt. But the new GE boss is only 44 years old and corporate recruiters are eying other GE executives eager for a shot at the top job somewhere else.
Alan Dodd Frank, CNN financial news, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)
DOBBS: Coming up next, sluggish sales and summer clearance sales hitting profits at a leading shoe retailer. In just a little while, a few rounds with boxing promoter Don King.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

DOBBS: In tonight's sectors report: retails. Payless shoe source today warning it will miss profit targets for the entire year. The discount shoe retailer saying an anticipated rebound in June did not happen. Payless also saying slow sales forcing higher-than-planned markdowns on summer shoes.
UBS Warburg saying today it expects overall retail sales for the sector to be weak in June, those figures due out
Thursday.

Retail analysts also saying aggressive pricing is likely to come at the expense of gross margins. Payless, the biggest point decliner on the New York Stock Exchange today, dropping more than $7 a share. And the rest of the sector also weak.
Coming up next, the man who brought us several fights of the century is ready to rumble again with "The Great
Brawl Of China."
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

DOBBS: Our next guest has been behind some of the biggest fights of the last three decades. In classic bouts like "The Rumble Of The Jungle, " he promoted fighters like Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. Lifting boxing to international heights, and recent years, has seen the sweet science fall on harder times.

Don King however has not fallen on anything. He keeps moving ahead. He has a new main event to promote: "The Great Brawl Of China," a title bout in Beijing between Evander Holyfield and John Ruiz.
Joining us now, the man himself, Don King. Don, a pleasure to see you.
DON KING, BOXING PROMOTER: Lou, it's just a pleasure to be on your program. When you talk money, there's no one to talk but Lou Dobbs. I told the Chinese $1,300,000,000 that I want to introduce to them a financial consultant and adviser, a man who knows what to do --- oh, ain't he right? So, they welcome you with great aplomb. And they want you to be there with us.
DOBBS: Well, I appreciate the invitation. We'd love to come and join you. KING: Yes.
DOBBS: Let me ask you something. This fight, you've come up with some great titles, but the Great Brawl Of
China.

KING: This one now we changed. We got it now, the Quiet Man and Raging Warrior. Holyfield has become enraged, because everyone is telling him to retire. And he feels his body is in good condition, so they almost had a fight today at the press conference.
And so we took it from the Hidden Dragon and the Crouching Tiger. So now it's the Quiet Man and the Raging
Warrior in Beijing.
DOBBS: Beijing.
KING: It's going to be exciting. A trillion dollar market for business.. DOBBS: A trillion.
Page 18 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
KING: A trillion. And this is the beginning.
DOBBS: How much money do you figure you are going to make on this?

KING: I'm not going to make much money. What I'm doing right now, is I'm cultivating the soil. I'm planting the seeds. Mao Tse-tung says, we are the seeds, the party are the seeds and the people are the soil.

So you must plant yourself into the soil and cultivate arts and sciences and (UNINTELLIGIBLE) bringing in the arts and dealing with business.
DOBBS: How does Ruiz and Holyfield feel about being seedcorn?

KING: You know what they are doing? They are making money. They are making good old American money. In the millions. You know what I mean? But it is such a market -- such an opportunity. A 1960 opportunity in the 21st century.
DOBBS: Now, obviously, this is a terrific gamble on your part. Pay-per-view, you're going to do it through King
Vision, and -- which means Don King will be bringing it to you.
KING: Isn't it great to be an American.
DOBBS: It absolutely is. Let's wave that flag one more time.

KING: There's no beating 4th of July, through Independence Day. God bless America and God bless you that's watching this program. Oh, Lou Dobbs, I'm so -- I just love you, man.
DOBBS: Well, I love back, Don. (LAUGHTER)
KING: You're pure Americana. You're what I'm talking about. You stand up and fight! DOBBS: Well, now, you're -- yeah, I've been known to do that.
(LAUGHTER)
DOBBS: But your fight in Beijing -- how did you come to the idea of going to Beijing with a fight?

KING: Well, you know, the Chinese came and got me, you know, for my activity here, under the struggle, fighting and standing up. You know, resisting oppression, resisting things that are wrong, although they condemn me for everything, I'm to blame for everything. They selected me, and when they did, I met everybody there -- the biggest recognition and reception in the history of my life, I got it in China.

They gave me the Golden Dragon. They gave it to George Herbert Bush, president of the United States. They gave me the tea kettle and the donkey. They gave it to William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United States. And so they gave me an award of the ambassador, and they did it by a government portfolio. So I'm an ambassador of good will for China to bring Chinese and American people together.

DOBBS: You know, for a man who has brought so much goodwill, been recognized for goodwill, there have been more people suing, coming after you for so many years, I don't think -- if I may borrow an expression from your craft -- they haven't laid a glove on you.

KING: You know what? You've got to understand something, Lou. When you get a lot of money, people always come at you. You ain't got no money if you can count it. My money is countable, but I have an extraordinary amount, you know what I mean?
(LAUGHTER)
KING: So you people always want some. You can't stop that. That's the American way. I don't get mad at them. I
say, forgive them, Father, they know not what they doing.

DOBBS: Well, you know what you're doing, and the fight just a few days before your 70th birthday -- you were talking about retirement early. I don't see any sign of it.


Page 19 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
KING: Well, you know what? I'm excited and I want to take you there because I think truly that we can -- in fact, I've got him here. I want you to meet him because we can make billions and billions of dollars for American entrepreneurs, you've got a great marketplace and you talked about money. You know money. Let's make it happen.
DOBBS: That's a heavy responsibility. I'd be glad to join you, when you talk about that much money. KING: Let's do it.
DOBBS: Thanks very much. Don King.

KING: August the fourth. Live and living color from Beijing, you will see Holyfield and Ruiz, the quiet man and the raging warrior! DOBBS: And I feel like the quiet man, now.
KING: Pay-per-view on King Vision!
DOBBS: Up next, your e-mails and "Ahead of the Curve."

KING: You hear it here on LOU DOBBS, the best man in the land, talking about M-O-N-E-Y. And we know it! That's why you're back. Lou is back!
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

DOBBS: All financial markets closed tomorrow in observance of the July 4th holiday. Tune in to MONEYLINE, our special holiday edition of "Hail to the Chiefs," a look at high-profile CEO's faced with the toughest business environment in a decade. No rest for economy watchers later in the week. Expect weekly jobless claims on Thursday, and the all-important unemployment report for June will be released Friday.
Now, a quick update on our top story. Honeywell naming Larry Bossidy as new chairman and CEO -- Peter Viles. VILES: The key statement, I think, from this release, Lou, is that the new strategy at Honeywell under Larry
Bossidy will -- quote -- "enhance share owner value as an independent company." So nothing in this release
about Honeywell still being for sale. They did give new earnings guidance, 53 or 55 cents a share and ongoing
earnings in this quarter. That's the low end of expectations, but the fact that they came out with new guidance
tonight could give some credibility to this company in the markets. They also will take a charge in the
neighborhood of $600 million.
DOBBS: And Larry Bossidy, a leader with definite credibility. Thanks.

Now a look at some of your e-mails. We had a big response to our look at stem cell research last night, Roger writing: "As one of those whose life depends on this research, I'm sensitive to the view of the public who think that this research is only about aborted fetuses and not about those of us who have a chance to continue living our lives, when in the past our diagnoses would have been an early death sentence."

Angelo writes: "I am a 27-year-old with a spinal cord injury and a single parent. I wish people would stop the delay of embryonic stem cell research. I don't want to live like this the rest of my life."
And that is why it's important for both political parities to rise above politics and ideology on the issue.

Now a question posed by a viewer last night as we were running out of time: "Who would replace Vice President Dick Cheney if he were to resign?" President Bush would nominate a new vice president. The 25th Amendment to the Constitution makes a provision for that, saying "whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the vice president, the president shall nominate who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both houses of Congress."
We've also been getting a lot of e-mail concerning the European Union blocking that GE-Honeywell deal. Don in
Utah writing: "Why do Europeans have say or control about that merger of two U.S. corporations?"

It's simply because U.S. companies must comply with European regulations in order to do business there. It is a two-way street. European companies must also abide by U.S. law to do business here. Of the nearly 400 cases reviewed by the United States and Europe over the past decade, only one deal blocked by Brussels: the Worldcom-Sprint deal, Washington also blocking that merger as well. And this deal, GE-Honeywell, becoming the first of two U.S. companies to be blocked in its entirety by the Europeans.

EU panel expected to pan GE deal

The European Union's 20-member executive  commission plans to vote today on  General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last minute proposals or withdrawal of the  merger, EU officials said yesterday.
The EU is widely expected to  reject the deal at its meeting in Strasbourg, France.

EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres said, "If the merger notification remains on the table, the commission will have to make a decision. She noted, however, that merger approval applications can be withdrawn by the companies at "at any time."
"There are no plans for withdrawal," GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said yesterday.
GE shares were up $1.20 yesterday to close at $50.20. Honeywell shares were down 79 cents to close at $34.11. If the merger were to be officially rejected, GE either could challenge the decision in court or file a new application
and start the process again.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

The chances that GE will submit a revised proposal are dim, after GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell on Friday. GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch said Honeywell's proposal made no sense for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.
GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said the company had no plans to make further proposals to the Europeans. "We're not optimistic of approval," she said Friday.

Failure to Acquire  Honeywell  Is Sour Finish for G.E. Chief
By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

A front-page article yesterday about the effect of the collapse of the  merger between General Electric  and Honeywell  International on the reputation of G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr., misstated the title of his successor, Jeffrey R. Immelt. He is president and chairman-elect, not chief executive.

The article also misidentified the company acquired by the Boeing Company in 1997 in a deal nearly blocked by the European Commission. It was the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, not the Lockheed Martin Corporation.
CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES WEDNESDAY JULY 04, 2001

John F. Welch Jr. was supposed to be retired from  General Electric  by now, his legacy as corporate America's most-admired manager firmly intact.

But his final act as chairman of G.E., to bid for the industrial conglomerate  Honeywell  International and postpone his retirement, is turning out to be a case study in miscalculations.

Despite weeks of last-ditch maneuvers, the $45 billion deal that was going to cap Mr. Welch's career is now dead. Today, European regulators are planning to vote against the proposal, the first time an American deal has been blocked solely by Europeans.

Mr. Welch, known for sizing up businesses in a heartbeat, misread the situation early on. He failed to anticipate Europeans' anticompetitive concerns, saying regulators would find ''the cleanest deal you've ever seen.'' And he was blindsided by the economy's downturn, its damaging effect on Honeywell's business and that company's desperation to complete the deal.

''I could've gone home early and been a great hero,'' Mr. Welch said when he announced the deal in October in NBC's Studio 8-H, where ''Saturday Night Live'' is produced. (G.E. owns NBC.) ''I'm the one that's putting my neck on the line.''

Mr. Welch's decisiveness, which served him so well in his 20 years running G.E. and drove up the company's market value by $474 billion, led him to put the deal together in just a few days without sounding out regulators. And when they balked, he refused to make enough concessions to satisfy them.

Nonetheless, many investors suggest that Mr. Welch's final decision to walk away rather than risk harming shareholders may have actually solidified his reputation as a great leader. ''Maybe there will always be the footnote, but at least he's not selling the ship for his own ego,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager of the Dreyfus Corporation, whose funds hold millions of G.E. shares.

When Mr. Welch became the youngest chief executive in G.E.'s history in 1981, he combined candor with a demanding leadership style, deciding to focus on areas where G.E. could be No. 1 or 2 in a market. For any other unit, he would say fix it, sell it or close it. The harsh approach earned him the name Neutron Jack for someone who kills off people but leaves the physical assets intact.

His winning ways earned his selection as America's most-admired businessman, but crossing cultural divides was never his strength. Mr. Welch, 65, who stretched his retirement date from April to the end of the year to complete the merger, declined to be interviewed for this article.

But in retrospect, Mr. Welch's first mistake on the Honeywell deal was apparent the day he announced it. ''We haven't touched every base,'' he said when asked whether G.E. and Honeywell had contacted regulators in the United States and Europe, as is often the case on big transactions.

Indeed, the deal was negotiated in only 72 hours by Mr. Welch, who rushed to break up a planned merger between Honeywell and United Technologies, an old-style conglomerate that makes Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines and Otis Elevators. Honeywell -- formed by a merger of Honeywell and Allied Signal -- produces aerospace systems, power and transportation products, specialty chemicals, home security systems and building climate controls, as in Honeywell thermostats. It was considered a good complement to General Electric's disparate portfolio, including aircraft engines and the NBC network television, though regulators were expected to scrutinize the deal and ask for certain divestitures.

It was more than two months before Mr. Welch realized that the deal could face serious obstacles in Europe, executives close to him said. American regulators had given an early indication the deal would be approved, though they dragged their feet because of the change in administration. Meanwhile, the European Commission's competition regulator, Mario Monti, privately made noise about the deal being anticompetitive because of G.E.'s ability to bundle products and services, effectively directing business to itself.

By late February, after rivals like United Technologies, Rockwell International and Rolls-Royce complained to the commission about the deal, Mr. Monti announced his task force would expand its investigation, meaning four more months before the deal could be completed, if at all.

In early May, G.E. agreed to sell Honeywell's helicopter-engine business and take other steps to win regulatory approval in the United States. To Mr. Welch and his top advisers, that approval should have solved the European problem.

''At the time, we thought it would be impossible that the Europeans would try to block a U.S.-U.S. deal that had been given the go-ahead by Washington,'' said an executive close to G.E. who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''The conventional wisdom was that the political pressure would be too great.''

Some of Mr. Welch's lawyers in Brussels that had worked with Mr. Monti knew better. Mr. Monti, a soft-spoken, silver-haired Italian economist, has not been one to bend under political pressure. Even G.E. executives acknowledge that Mr. Monti stuck to his interpretation of the law, inspired by principles, not by politics.

And by June, it was clear to many inside G.E. and Honeywell that Mr. Monti would require the combined company to make major concessions to win his approval.

While United States regulators are most concerned with a proposed deal's impact on consumers, European regulators place just as much emphasis on the effect on the commercial market. The European Commission, which is the executive arm of the 15-nation European Union, generally has jurisdiction over any business with more than $225 million in annual revenue in Europe and has shown considerable strength. In 1997, it nearly blocked Boeing's acquisition of Lockheed Martin, despite pressure from the United States, and forced the companies to make significant concessions at the last minute to win European approval. And the proposed merger of Worldcom and Sprint was rejected by the Europeans even before Washington rejected it.

So in mid-June, Mr. Welch took the corporate jet to Brussels to take a last stab at convincing Mr. Monti the deal would not stifle competition. He offered to divest $2.2 billion worth of annual sales from Honeywell's avionics business and to make accounting and other management changes to its aviation financing business, GE Capital Aviation Services, or Gecas.
But it was not enough.

Mr. Monti wanted G.E. to sell 19.9 percent of the aviation financing business to the public. The commission believed that the unit, which owns and leases 950 aircraft, could create incentives for aircraft makers to also buy G.E. engines and other aviation products, giving the company an unfair edge over competitors like Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney.
Mr. Welch refused to sell part of that business. If a stake was sold to the public, rivals like Rolls-Royce and Pratt
& Whitney could buy into the business.

For Mr. Monti, that was exactly the point. He believed that competitors could effectively keep the G.E. unit from unfairly cutting out competitors and owning the market.

After several days of intense negotiations, Mr. Welch submitted his proposal -- without the concessions sought by
Mr. Monti -- and flew home knowing the deal would not be approved.

Behind the scenes, friction between Mr. Welch and Honeywell's chief executive, Michael R. Bonsignore, was growing. Privately, Mr. Welch and his successor, Jeffrey Immelt, suggested killing the deal and withdrawing the proposal to the commission, executives close to the company said. Executives close to G.E. said that as Mr. Immelt's role grew -- he was named chief executive in late November -- he became more averse to making additional concessions.

But Mr. Bonsignore pressed them to submit the proposal, citing G.E.'s requirement to make its ''best efforts'' under the merger agreement.

The next day, Mr. Welch publicly said the deal was dead. ''Jeff Immelt and I wanted to complete the transaction, but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal,'' he said. ''The commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point.''
Honeywell's stock went into a tailspin, dropping more than 10 percent from the previous day.

Honeywell and its lawyers began assembling several different plans to try to resuscitate the deal. For Honeywell, the deal's collapse would mean being back on the market and being scrutinized by investors. Executives close to the company say its earnings have fallen significantly in the second quarter, suggesting the stock price could fall further and make it a weakened takeover target.

An executive close to G.E. suggested that Honeywell's recent poor financial performance was another reason Mr. Welch was unwilling to make such divestitures. Mr. Welch was also being pressed by Mr. Immelt, who after all would have to run the combined company.

Last Monday, Mr. Welch met Mr. Bonsignore in New York at G.E.'s offices in Rockefeller Center with a team of executives and lawyers. Mr. Welch and Mr. Bonsignore discussed modifying their proposal to try to meet Mr. Monti's demands. They knew it was a long shot, the executives said, but G.E. would offer to sell 19.9 percent of Gecas to a financial company, not a competitor. At the very least, G.E. would be able to say it made its best effort, the executives said.

G.E.'s revised offer, however, came with strings attached. The outside investor -- the financial company -- would get preferred stock that could not be transferred without the approval of G.E. While the investor would get a seat on the unit's board, it was unclear how much voting power the member would have.

On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Monti phoned Mr. Welch and Mr. Bonsignore, rejecting the plan as keeping the outside investor effectively in lockstep with G.E.

The next day, Mr. Bonsignore dropped a bombshell that he had hinted at earlier in the week during his meeting with Mr. Welch: Honeywell would be willing to take $1.8 billion less from G.E. if Mr. Welch would concede to Mr. Monti's recommendations.
Mr. Bonsignore distributed the letter to the press within minutes of sending it to Mr. Welch. ''It was incredible,'' one
G.E. executive said. ''Jack hadn't even seen the letter first. It was a total desperation move.''

Mr. Welch convened his board, the executives said. That afternoon, Mr. Welch sent his own letter, also distributed publicly, rejecting the Honeywell proposition. Perhaps partly for legal reasons as well as public relations, his letter seemed quite friendly. ''I am very grateful for all your efforts,'' Mr. Welch wrote, signing it, ''Best, Jack.''

Last weekend, both companies held a marathon of conference calls to consider withdrawing their proposal before the commission formally blocks it. Though G.E. wanted to avoid a formal decision that might create a precedent affecting future deals, Honeywell did not give its consent.

Executives close to Honeywell are weighing whether to file a lawsuit against G.E. for breeching its agreement on grounds that it did not make its ''best efforts'' to complete the deal.

Honeywell's board is scheduled to meet Tuesday, and Mr. Bonsignore, who was on his way out under G.E.'s leadership, may find himself on the way out anyway, without a deal, according to stock analysts.

For Mr. Welch, the story is hardly over. He will be leaving G.E. soon, though the company has not yet announced when, and plans a consulting career. He has also sold the rights to his soon-to-be-published memoir for more than $7 million.

His reputation of creating value for shareholders and making tough business decisions remains unbesmirched. But when the dust settles, Mr. Welch may find the collapsed deal more than just a footnote. Will there be lasting effects on G.E.'s ability to expand in Europe? And will G.E.'s astounding financial performance continue after he retires?

When Mr. Immelt told Le Monde, the French newspaper, that there was zero chance of the deal going through two weeks ago, he seemingly distanced himself from Mr. Welch, whom he called ''a great teacher.''

''The most important thing that Jack can do now so I can really take the reins is to leave,'' he said. ''I could always call him and ask him for advice. But, physically, the business can only have one leader.''

GE, Honeywell merger faces final rejection --- EU commission to vote on deal today in France

The European Union's 20-member executive commission is expected to vote today to  reject General Electric Co.'s $41 billion (U.S.) purchase of Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last-minute proposals or withdrawal of the merger, EU officials said yesterday.
The EU has scheduled a vote on the blockbuster deal at its meeting in Strasbourg, France. "It's on the agenda and they will vote (today)," EU spokesperson Michael Tscherny said.
EU spokesperson Amelia Torres said, "If the merger notification remains on the table, the commission will have to make a decision." She noted, however, that merger approval applications can be withdrawn by the companies at "at any time."
"There are no plans for withdrawal," GE spokesperson Gary Sheffer said yesterday.

In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares rose $1.20 to $50.20 while Honeywell shares fell 79 cents to $34.11 a share.

If the merger were to be officially rejected today, GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the approval process all over again, EU officials said.

Commission experts have argued that if GE were to combine with Honeywell, the new firm would enjoy an unfair advantage over rivals in the markets for large civil aircraft and avionics.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S., Canadian and Mexican laws to do business in North America.

Two weeks ago, GE offered to sell assets that generate $2.2 billion in revenues and separate the management and accounts of its aircraft leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, or Gecas, from the rest of the company. That fell short of regulators' demands.

The chances that GE will submit a revised proposal are slim, after GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell on Friday. GE chief executive Jack Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his industrial company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to sell more of its holdings to satisfy antitrust regulators.

GE spokesperson Louise Binns said the global giant had no plans to make further proposals to the Europeans before today.
"We're not optimistic of approval," she said.
Binns refused to comment on whether GE was considering withdrawing its merger application.

General Electric is one of the world's biggest companies with operations around the world in electronics, specialized technology, jet engine and industrial manufacturing, leasing, financing and numerous other businesses. The company has key operations in Canada, centred in Ontario.

Honeywell is a major multinational company, with a focus on measurement technologies and other high-tech businesses. It also has significant operations in Canada.

GE/Honeywell  end likely today EC action signals  scrutiny of future deals

BRUSSELS -- Barring last-minute action by the companies, the  European Commission was expected to  reject the proposed merger of General Electric  and Honeywell  at a meeting today, a move that puts the U.S. business community on notice that mergers approved  in Washington won't automatically sail across the Atlantic.
A decade ago, U.S. companies could consider  Europe an afterthought in their  merger plans. But no more. In the 1990s, 15 European countries effectively pooled competition rules for international corporations in a
specialized board under the European Commission. That panel has begun throwing its weight around.

"In a globalizing world, we cannot afford to limit ourselves to our own borders," says Mario Monti, Europe's activist antitrust chief.

In this case, the commission's competition agency, headed by Monti, required concessions that GE wasn't willing to make.

It won't be the first time the commission has said no. But the big case signals that globalization means companies operating around the world will face more scrutiny overseas, especially in Europe, a customer base that businesses cannot afford to pass up.

Benn Steil, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, says European regulators are "just beginning to sharpen their teeth."
More differences likely
Steil, co-author of Antitrust Goes Global, sees potential for more frequent disagreements between Europe and the
United States, as regulators are presented with more cases in which international companies dominate markets.

Philosophical differences account for some of the tension. For example, U.S. companies can sometimes defend a merger on grounds of efficiency in Washington but not in Europe.

But in many cases, a merger has a different potential impact in the European market than in the USA, Steil says. "We have to accept that a merger like this is going to have significant economic impacts in Europe. It's no longer possible to say that this is purely a domestic issue, and the EU has nothing."

The GE/Honeywell decision is the culmination of months of parrying between the companies and the commission, which represents the European Union, a compilation of Western European governments. The $40 billion deal was approved by U.S. regulators in early May. But Europe's antitrust branch balked. It said that, despite the U.S. position, the new company would have too much leverage in the aviation business.

Monti insisted that with jet engines, leasing, credit and other services all under one roof, competition would be stifled.

The commission asked GE to split off its credit branch, but GE's counteroffers fell short. Despite intense pressure, including criticism from President Bush and top aides, the commission stood fast.


Page 29 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Monti and the commission refuse to accept portrayal of their work as biased or unfair, and they deny that stricter rules are being applied than in the past. Monti says that Europe is becoming more like the USA in regulating competition.

Jacques Pelkmans, associate fellow at the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, says the American public hasn't noticed the European process before because there have been very few cases of disagreement.

"But because you don't hear much, doesn't mean nothing has happened," he says. Companies as big as GE are well aware of Europe's more active review process, he said, and know how to deal with it.

"American companies are very good at making noise and playing up the media," he said, but that can be "a very misleading picture."

Since 1990, the commission has reviewed nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies. Only one has been stopped before: the proposed merger of WorldCom and Sprint, also rejected in Washington. In several other cases, the commission has imposed conditions, but most proposals have gone through untouched.
No bias, EU says

To underscore Monti's insistence that there's no anti-U.S. bias, spokeswoman Amelia Torres recites a list of European mergers which were rejected, including such high-profile cases as Volvo's attempt to buy truckmaker Scania.

And the commission has at times backed protests by U.S. companies about European competitors, including a United Parcel Service complaint last year about joint operations by Deutsche Post, Germany's mail service, and DHL, a delivery company.

In the GE/Honeywell case, not only did European competitors contact the commission, but it also heard concerns from U.S. rivals, including United Technologies.

The GE/Honeywell case may be the biggest so far, but it won't be the last. The commission regulates not only mergers but broader cases involving antitrust and competition issues. Among those under study now: Microsoft.

How Merger Rules Ended Up Seeming An Ocean Apart --- EU Focuses on Competitors; U.S. Focuses on
Consumers --- Closely Matched Teams or a Dynasty?
By Bob Davis and Anita Raghavan

Antitrust cops in Europe and the U.S. work the same beat, but they don't always patrol the streets the same way.

That is clear from the attempted  merger of General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc.  European      regulators tend to worry first of all about whether the merger will hurt business competition. Their American counterparts tend to focus on whether it will hurt consumers.

"The advance of consumer interests ... is fundamentally the underlying rule of all American antitrust statutes," Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told a Senate panel a few days ago. "That's not true in Europe."

Today, the European Commission is scheduled to make a final decision on the $42.2 billion (49.68 billion euro) GE-Honeywell deal at a meeting is Strasbourg, France. There is little expectation that European regulators will withdraw their antitrust objections and approve the merger. That leaves the much larger question: How do regulators from similar free-market democracies arrive at such divergent views in the first place?

The answer lies in some powerful forces -- in the way war, peace and recovery have affected the political and economic development of the U.S. and Europe during the past 50 years. One place where their paths have diverged is on what makes sense in the new economy emerging on both sides of the Atlantic. And while the views aren't radically different, their implications can be large.

"You see these tendencies coming out in random, unpredictable ways," says Christopher Bright, an antitrust lawyer with Shearman & Sterling who has represented GE in its Honeywell merger. "In cases where there is some political tension, you see them pop out."

Charles Stark, who recently left the U.S. Justice Department after heading its international antitrust division and works for Wilmer Cutler & Pickering, a law firm that represented Honeywell, offers a sports analogy. The
European Union's antitrust cops prefer a world of many closely matched teams near parity, battling year after year for dominance. U.S. regulators are comfortable with a powerhouse dynasty free to use its might to acquire players and invest in team development -- provided the fans are still getting to see a good game at a reasonable price.

The expected collapse of the GE-Honeywell deal is likely to cast a pall over Wall Street's already-sleepy merger business. "It will slow merger activity down, particularly large deals where the players have reasonable market size" says Mr. Bright.

Among the victims could be United Technologies Corp., the parent of aircraft-maker Pratt & Whitney, which spent months trying to kill the GE-Honeywell deal. United Technologies, with whom Honeywell nearly merged before
GE jumped in with a better offer, is a likely buyer of the company. Also awaiting antitrust scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic is Nestle SA, which earlier this year unveiled plans to buy Ralston Purina Co. for $10.1 billion.

In the proposed GE-Honeywell merger, European regulators worried about "bundling," or the potential for GE to use its clout to tie two core products into a single package -- jet engines and Honeywell avionics -- and sell it at a price lower than European competitors could match. The European Commission acknowledged that this might

lead to lower prices for customers in the short and medium term. But it also worried that it might erode profit margins for GE's rivals and undermine the state of competition in the aerospace industry in the long run.

A similar concern animated the commission's debate about GE Capital Aviation Services, or Gecas, which offers attractive financing packages to buyers of large aircraft. The commission was worried that, while Gecas's innovative financing techniques could result in attractive packages for customers, it would create an unfair advantage over competitors like Rolls-Royce PLC and Pratt & Whitney. U.S. regulators looked at Gecas but took no action in part because Gecas was extant before the merger and was not being altered by the merger per se.

With the GE-Honeywell merger all but dead, corporate executives and government officials are going to be focusing on whether these same kinds of disagreements could arise again. The merger sailed through in the U.S. with only minor alterations; when it faltered in Europe, current and former U.S. officials lobbied the European Commission to change its mind. The case highlights the prospect that antitrust enforcement could become a continuing source of tension between the U.S. and Europe.

Some officials argue that, despite the views that separate the two sides, they have kept disputes to a minimum. "Our respective rules, while phrased in quite different language, and with very different historical antecedents, are, in most respects, pursuing the same objectives," Mario Monti, the European Commissioner in charge of
competition policy, said a few days ago. Though there has never been "any attempt to harmonize these laws," he added, there has been a "marked convergence" in application of them in recent times.

To understand the differences, it's necessary to examine how seeds that were planted decades ago, on both sides of the Atlantic, have blossomed in recent years.

European antitrust policy rose out of the ashes of World War II. In its formative years, it was heavily influenced by the condition of the European Continent in the war's aftermath, especially in Germany. Hoping to diminish the power of the industrial barons that had bankrolled the Nazi war machine, the U.S. pushed for West Germany to establish an antitrust policy to make sure that such industrial conglomerates couldn't gain the same power as they accumulated in the 1930s. Britain also was starting to restructure industry to make it less cartel-like. But Germany's more rigorous regulations became the bedrock of European antitrust thinking.

Drawing on the Freiburg school of economics, whose defining tenet was a concept of "Soziale Marktwirschaft," or capitalism with social responsibility, the German antitrust system had strict legal prohibitions against abuses of dominant position. The German approach also held that competition was defined by the absence of restrictions
on economic freedom. In practical terms, this meant that antitrust policy should be geared toward keeping markets open, allowing as many competitors as possible, even if that reduced efficiency.

To a large extent, today's European antitrust policy is based on the German model. "The Germans are the real fathers of European merger control," says Alec Burnside, a partner at the law firm of Linklaters & Alliance in Brussels.
But other impulses began to tug at Europeans. They began to think of themselves as a single market rather than
a collection of small ones. At the same time, the Continent's leaders -- West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg -- sought to prevent another war by blocking any one country from controlling the
means of war, which were mainly coal and steel then. These and some other key industries that were considered
important to European security were to be organized along Europe-wide lines, rather than national lines.
The Continent's leaders, now joined in the six-member European Commuity under the Treaty of Rome signed in
1951, set up Europe-wide cartel rules for these industries in 1952. There was no central merger law, but there
was a general belief that mergers "would be good for integration," says New York University antitrust expert
Eleanor Fox.

Eventually, policy makers came to see "national champions" in other areas -- computers, semiconductors, automobiles, aircraft, defense and other large industries -- as a way to compete directly with giant companies in the U.S. and Japan. European countries promoted these industrial giants through technology grants and government contracts.

By the late 1980s, however, European thinking began to rebel against that idea. European leaders came to think that these industrial giants had failed to produce economic growth and still lagged behind in competition with the U.S. and Japan. So in response, Europe's goal began to shift. The aim became to use antitrust policy to assure more competition, in the belief that this was the only way for Europe to stay healthy in global economic fights. Antitrust thinking moved back closer to its postwar roots.

Page 32 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Today, the people in charge of antitrust policy are taking an aggressive position on competition because they believe in the bankruptcy of national champions," says Harvard Business School Professor David Yoffie. In short, European thinking became: Keep as many competitors on the field as possible, and the economy will benefit.

In the U.S., antitrust thinking has evolved over a different and longer timeline. Antitrust policy in Washington began taking shape with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, though the power of that legislation wasn't really brought to bear until the trust-busting Theodore Roosevelt came to the White House a decade later. President Roosevelt was so concerned about the growth of industrial conglomerates that he called for establishment of a new cabinet agency -- the predecessor of today's Commerce Department -- in part to help monitor trusts.

Early U.S. trustbusters weren't concerned so much with mergers but with something that is prominent in today's European worries: interlocking trusts, in which a single company can dominate not just one market niche but several. In Roosevelt's time, the interlocking trusts that roused the regulators were those that dominated railroads, harvesting machines and oil. "The concern was that big firms could steer customers to themselves, and win business not on the merit," says Prof. Fox of New York University.

Early in the century, the trust-busting impulse led the U.S. to go after Standard Oil, American Tobacco Co. and the DuPont empire. Over time, that distrust of massed corporate power was applied not just to breaking up companies because their size and reach were deemed too great, but also to proposed mergers that might produce the same outcome. By the 1960s, antitrust policy sometimes was being used essentially to advance a social theory, that small businesses were better for the country than big businesses. "It was clearly social, rather
than economic rationales," says James Rill, who was head of Justice Department antitrust enforcement in the first
Bush administration.

But by the 1970s, that version of American big-is-bad thinking was changing, as academics and intellectuals began arguing for a different approach. With the arrival of the Reagan administration in the 1980s, a new era of antitrust thought arrived, one that reflected a broad new American belief in the power of markets to make better decisions than could social engineers or regulators.

Influenced heavily by conservative economic and legal thinkers mainly at the University of Chicago, the U.S. began to focus on the effect a merger would have on prices, innovation and product development, rather than the fate of the companies left to compete with the new entity. In short, the new approach placed less emphasis on market analysis, and more on economic analysis. The focus became how a merger affected the consumer, not how it affected the competitive balance between business rivals.

While Europe and the U.S. have arrived at somewhat different intellectual points, this doesn't mean that there will be constant disagreements, or that the EU is simply against megamergers. It allowed the AOL-Time Warner merger, which took effect in January without any required remedies, despite many complaints from some competitors or would-be competitors.

And it allowed the merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corp., which took effect in November 1998, noting in its announcement simply that "for all passenger cars, the combined Daimler-Benz/Chrysler market share, in terms of registered cars in 1997, will not exceed 10% in the European Economic Area or in any individual Member State."

But concerns about competition can arise. In the Microsoft Corp.-Telewest Communications PLC case last year, the commission argued that by taking control of Telewest, Microsoft would be able to act in concert with Telewest's second major shareholder, AT&T Corp.'s Liberty Media, and coax Telewest into choosing Microsoft software for its cable set-top boxes. Left unrestricted, Microsoft's foray into digital television through joint control of Telewest "could have substantially reduced the technological alternatives available to customers and led to
potentially higher prices for households," the commission feared. In the end, Microsoft had to sever its contractual links with Liberty Media, preventing the software concern from exercising joint control over Telewest.

It's far too early to make judgments about whether the U.S. or European style of antitrust enforcement makes more sense for modern economy. To the degree that European regulators protect local companies, and that protects the jobs of those who work there, antitrust policy is one more strand of a social safety net that is badly frayed in the U.S. To the extent that EU policy blocks megamergers -- or frightens companies from attempting such combinations -- it probably affects the U.S. and European economies equally because the companies involved are global concerns.

Collapse of the GE-Honeywell merger would "probably deter any really big deals," says Robert Litan, a former Clinton antitrust official now at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "But if we end up with a world with fewer megacompanies, I'm not sure we're worse off."

Rather, the effects are more likely to be parochial and political. U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, who heads the aviation subcommittee, has already begun making threats about blocking mergers sought by European companies. Other lawmakers are likely to board an anti-Europe bandwagon, especially if the U.S. fights with Europe over steel trade intensify. The Bush administration will be under increasing pressure to find a reason to block a merger that European companies want, whether for national security or other rationales.

However, the imbroglio could have some positive effects too. The dispute will give renewed emphasis on coming up with some common rules on antitrust enforcement, not just between the U.S. and Europe, but with the 60 or so nations that have merger controls. Indeed, says Gary Hufbauer, a trade economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington D.C., the dispute could give impetus to a new round of global trade talks, which could include competition policy.

EU PANEL TO VOTE ON GE DEAL TODAY

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The  European Union's 20-member executive  Commission plans to vote today on General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last minute proposals or withdrawal of the  merger, EU officials said Monday.
The EU is widely expected to  reject the deal at its meeting in Strasbourg, France.
``It's on the agenda and they will vote Tuesday,'' said EU spokesman Michael Tscherny.

EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres said, ``If the merger notification remains on the table, the Commission will have to make a decision. She noted, however, that merger approval applications can be withdrawn by the companies at ``at any time.''
``There are no plans for withdrawal,'' GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said Monday.
In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares were up $1.20 to close at $50.20, while
Honeywell shares were down 79 cents and closed at $34.11 a share.

If the merger were to be officially rejected today, GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again, EU officials said.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

The chances that GE will submit a revised proposal are dim, after GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell on Friday. GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said Honeywell's proposal ``makes no sense'' for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.
GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said GE has no plans to make further proposals to the Europeans before today.
``We're not optimistic of approval,'' she said Friday.
Binns refused to comment late Sunday on whether GE was considering withdrawing its merger application. Document TMNN000020120818dx7300i8x

O'Neill hits EU body for blocking GE merger

Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill sharply criticized European Unionregulators yesterday for blocking the proposed merger of General Electric  and Honeywell,  accusing the EU body of abusing antitrust authority to meddle in U.S. economic affairs "outside their jurisdiction."

On the eve of a vote by the 20-member European Commission today that was widely expected to  reject GE's acquisition offer, Mr. O'Neill attacked the commission as a body "not elected by anyone" that was unfairly "reaching into the affairs of other countries" to protect its members from foreign  competition.

In an interview with The Washington Times, President Bush's chief economic adviser called the EU regulatory process deeply "flawed" and said "there is a need to make some correction in their mechanism."

Until recently, the Bush administration had been trying to negotiate a way out of the EU opposition to the deal. Mr. O'Neill escalated the rhetoric last week, calling EU resistance "off the wall." But his remarks yesterday were the administration's strongest criticism to date, appearing to challenge the whole notion that the European Union can block a merger between two global U.S. giants that happen to do a lot of business in Europe and compete with European companies.

"The European [regulatory] process is in my judgment flawed in the sense that the people who are making the judgments are not elected by anyone and their judgments are not subject to a judicial review or any kind of relief," Mr. O'Neill said.

"And it seems to me that there is a need to make some correction in their [regulatory and antitrust review] mechanism," he said, "especially in those cases where they are making judgments about business combinations of companies that are completely located outside their jurisdiction, such as General Electric and Honeywell, which are both headquartered in the U.S. . . .

"What the EU is doing is a far reach from looking at questions that are directly of interest to the European Union and reaching into the affairs of other countries," he said.

The EU's commission wanted GE to make substantial divestitures that GE said would make it financially unattractive and thus undermine the basis of the merger. GE agreed to sell its stake in an aircraft financing and leasing unit to win EU approval, but EU officials announced late last week that it backed Competition Commissioner Mario Mont's opposition to the merger.

That resulted in an administration decision over the weekend to "take the gloves off," said one administration official, and attack EU opposition to the deal in much stronger language.

"I'm troubled by the procedure and I'm troubled by the theory of the case, which is not one that focuses on the economic benefit of the customer but rather on protecting competitors - which seems to me to be inconsistent with the original founding notion of antitrust, that combinations not be permitted that will ultimately hurt the customers," he said.

"And I've not seen anything in the things that I've read about [EU] findings that suggested that their finding was based on injury to customer rather than on injury to competitors," he said.
On other issues, Mr. O'Neill believes that the U.S. economy has stopped declining.
"I don't think we're going down anymore. We're bouncing around at a low level of real positive growth," he said.

Page 36 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The economy was growing by 1.2 percent in the first quarter, and the administration has said it expects the economy to pick up in the fourth quarter and grow by 3.1 percent in the first six months of next year.

Mr. O'Neill pointed to a consensus forecast by private economists that saw economic growth running at 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter. "But I still think we have the potential to grow by 3.5 percent to 4 percent," he said.

EU likely to finalize GE-Honeywell  rift

You want to be a global company, you've got to play by global rules.

That's the lesson General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. will be left with after today's expected rejection of their merger application. A 20-member commission that oversees  antitrust and trade issues for the European Union is set to vote on the deal in Strasbourg, France.

Numerous executives involved in the deal said the commission will reject the GE buyout because it's worried about lack of competition in the markets for jet engines and airplane electronics. The $41 billion acquisition, announced last October, sailed past U.S. regulators with little problem.

The deal died Friday when it degenerated into a spat between GE Chairman Jack Welch and Michael Bonsignore, his counterpart at Honeywell. Bonsignore said he would take $2 billion less for Honeywell and proposed that GE sell off more assets to satisfy the EU.

Welch's reply was snippy: ''What the commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal.''

The European Commission feared that GE, through the financing arm of its aircraft-leasing unit, could dictate that customers buy equipment from the former Honeywell divisions.
Analysts said the deal's collapse carries few negative implications for GE, other than that it's a final misstep by
Welch.

Honeywell, however, could be seen as damaged goods. Shrinking economies in the United States and elsewhere have hurt Honeywell's controls, chemicals, consumer and aerospace units, and the company has acknowledged it will mist second-quarter earnings forecasts.

WSJ.COM WRAP: European Union Votes To Block  GE-Honeywell

A WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE News Roundup

STRASBOURG, France -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union blocked General Electric  Co.'s (GE) $41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. (HON) on Tuesday, the first time a proposed merger between two U.S. companies has been prevented solely by  European regulators.

The veto of one of the world's largest industrial mergers by the EU's 20-member executive commission was widely expected after the U.S. companies failed to allay European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engine and avionics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

The commission's decision was unanimous. It came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.

EU officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both companies were notified immediately after the decision.

The companies' plans now weren't immediately clear. GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again. But many believe the deal is dead.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

But the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities has raised American hackles. U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible "chilling effect" on trans-Atlantic relations. Even President Bush expressed concern.

EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust cooperation is generally good. As evidence, Mr. Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation between the agencies.

Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal -- WorldCom-Sprint -- was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.
On Friday GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell. GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack
Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest itself of more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.
As a result of the failed deal, Honeywell's board of directors intends to oust Chairman and Chief Executive
Michael Bonsignore at a meeting Tuesday, people familiar with the matter said.

The board is expected to name Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66 years old, the former Chairman and Chief Executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name. Bossidy, who served as chairman of the combined entity for four months, handed the reins to Bonsignore in April 2000.

GE Mulls 'All Options,' Including Appeal Of EU Ruling
By Christopher C. Williams

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Wall Street seems to have accepted the death of the merger between General          Electric  Co. (GE) and Honeywell  International Inc. (HON), but there's a slight chance GE may extend the saga by appealing the decision - if only to appease  Honeywell.

An appeal of the  European Union Commission's decision to block the $40 billion-plus deal stands almost no chance of getting a reversal, and the appeal process can take years. But the feeling on the Street is that  GE may want to appear to be doing all it can to satisfy  Honeywell,  which has pushed hard for the deal and which, according to The Wall Street Journal, may have no choice but to take  GE to court.

None of the companies that appealed commission rulings in six big deals over the past 10 years have won a reversal, according to the Journal.
Nevertheless, GE is leaving its options open.
When asked if GE is considering an appeal, GE Spokesman Gary Sheffer said, "we'll consider all our options." Officials of Honeywell weren't immediately available for comment. Honeywell held a board meeting in New York
on Tuesday and may hold a conference call later.

Justice  Dept Antitrust Chief Questions EU On GE-Honeywell

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)-  Europe's decision to block a  merger between General Electric  Co. (GE) and Honeywell  International Inc. (HON) "reflects a significant point of divergence" with the U.S., Assistant Attorney General for  Antitrust Charles James said in a statement Tuesday.

"For years, the U.S. and  European Union competition authorities have enjoyed close and cooperative relations," James said. "In fact, there were extensive consultations in this matter throughout the entire process."

But EU's decision "points to the continuing need for consultation to move toward greater policy convergence," James said.
The Justice Department had reached a "firm conclusion" that the merger, as conditioned, "would have been
pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers," James said. "Our conclusion was based on findings, confirmed by
customers worldwide, that the combined firm could offer better products and services at more attractive prices
than either firm could offer individually."

But the EU "apparently concluded that a more diversified, and thus more competitive, GE could somehow disadvantage other market participants," James said. "Consequently, we appear to have reached different results from similar assessments of competitive conditions in the affected markets.
U.S. antitrust policy holds that antitrust laws "protect competition, not competitors," James said. "Today's EU
decision reflects a significant point of divergence."

EU Commission Set To Vote On GE-Honeywell Merger

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)--The  European Union's 20-member executive  Commission is set to vote Tuesday on General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last minute proposals or withdrawal of the  merger, EU officials said.

If the  EU rejects the deal as expected, it would be the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been squashed solely by European regulators.

"If the merger notification remains on the table, the Commission will have to make a decision" at its meeting in Strasbourg, France, said EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres. She noted, however, that merger approval applications can be withdrawn by the companies at "at any time."
"There are no plans for withdrawal," GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said Monday.
In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares were up $1.20 to close at $50.20, while
Honeywell shares were down 79 cents and closed at $34.11 a share.

If the merger were to be officially rejected, GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again, EU officials said.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

The chances that GE will submit a revised proposal are dim, after GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell on Friday. GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.
GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said GE has no plans to make further proposals to the Europeans before
Tuesday. "We're not optimistic of approval," she said Friday.
Binns refused to comment late Sunday on whether GE was considering withdrawing its merger application.

In response to the threatened block of the deal, U.S. senators have accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible "chilling effect" on trans-Atlantic relations. Even President Bush expressed concern about the deal's rejection.

American companies have been turning to Europe for years to intervene in American mergers, in part because its antitrust machinery grants a greater voice to competitors.
After failing to convince U.S. antitrust officials to kill the deal, two Honeywell rivals, Rockwell International and
United Technologies Corp., lobbied the EU at a closed hearing in late May.

They complained that combining the financial power of GE's leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, with market dominance in jet engines and avionics could drive others out of business, eventually leading to higher prices for customers.

EU Commission Blocks  GE, Honeywell Merger - EU Source

STRASBOURG, France -(Dow Jones)- The  European Commission has blocked General Electric  Co.'s (GE)
$41-billion merger with Honeywell  International Inc. (HON), a highly-placed source at the Commission said
Tuesday.


E.U.
Competition  Commissioner Mario Monti is scheduled to hold a press conference at 1300 GMT to explain the decision.
- - 03/07/01 12-34G

(Corrected 1245GMT)

E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is scheduled to hold a press conference at 1300 GMT to explain the decision.


(A headline that ran at about 1234 GMT misstated the time of Monti's press briefing.)
- - 03/07/01 12-45G

According to the source, the Commission reached a unanimous decision after an hour-long meeting during which
Monti gave a presentation on his analysis of the case.
The source declined to say whether any Commissioners questioned the decision. Monti left the meeting without immediate comment.
The Commission's decision was widely expected after GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch last Friday rejected Honeywell's effort to salvage the deal.

Honeywell had tried to appease E.U. competition concerns by improving the company's concessions on GE Capital Aviation Services, or GECAS, the valuable aircraft-leasing unit and large purchaser of aircraft that the Commission says unfairly exerts pressure on manufacturers to buy GE products.

Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Bonsignore told Welch Friday that he was offering to drop his deal price by roughly $1.8 billion if Welch would agree to meet the E.U. conditions for approval
But Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense for our share owners."

"What the Commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," Welch said in a public letter.
Sources close to GE had last week downplayed the possibility that GE would win E.U. approval, saying GE
couldn't accept the Commission's demands on GECAS.

EU Confirms Blocks  GE, Honeywell Merger >GE HON
746 words
3 July 2001
14:49
Dow Jones International News

English
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Union Commission confirmed Tuesday that it has blocked  General   Electric  Co.'s (GE) $41-billion merger with Honeywell  International Inc. (HON).

"The Commission concluded that the merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the  competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of  Honeywell,"  it said in a statement.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell as it was notified would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in the statement.


"There were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed," Monti said. "I regret that the companies weren't able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns."
- - 03/07/01 13-02G

The Commission said, as GE has a dominant position in the market for jet engines and Honeywell is a leading supplier of avionics and non-avionics products, including engines for corporate jets and engine starters, the combination would have resulted in the creation of dominant market positions in the markets for the supply of avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines.
It would also strengthen GE's dominant position in jet engines for large commercial and regional jets. The Commission also found horizontal overlaps would have allowed GE to extend its financial power to
Honeywell's activities, allowing the "merged entity to leverage the respective market power of the two companies
into the products of one another."

"This would have the effect of foreclosing competitors, thereby eliminating competition in these markets, ultimately affecting adversely product quality, service and consumers' prices," the Commission said.

It said concessions offered on June 14 were insufficient to address the competition concerns, adding that the remedies offered later on June 28 "couldn't be accepted because it didn't resolve the problems identified in a sufficiently clear way at such a very late stage in the procedure."

Commenting on the Commission's relationship with the U.S. Department of Justice, which had cleared the merger, Monti said, "It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions, but each authority has to perform its own assessment."

"This doesn't mean that one authority is doing a technical analysis and the other pursuing a political goal...but simply that we might interpret facts differently and forecast the effects of an operation in different ways," he said.
"GE/Honeywell is a rare case where the transatlantic competition authorities have disagreed," Monti said. "I am determined to strengthen our bilateral cooperation in the future to try and reduce this risk further."
He noted that U.S. authorities have blocked mergers of E.U. companies because of competition concerns. Monti declined to respond to criticisms by U.S. officials of the Commission's handling of the case.

But he said that such public comments from politicians underline the need to distance regulation of mergers from political power.


This is the 15th time the Commission has blocked a merger since September 1990, the point at which it became the one-stop shop for mergers and acquisitions requiring regulatory approval in the E.U.
- - 03/07/01 13-29G

Speaking at a press conference in Strasbourg, Monti said that the Commission had "never asked" GE to cede control of Gecas, its aircraft leasing and financing arm.
"We (the Commission) were sensitive to GE's requirement not to give up control of Gecas," he said.

"However, we did require a structural committment so that there could be no discrimination as far as purchases were concerned," he added.

He said that airlines from both sides of the Atlantic had complaints about the deal, although they didn't go public with their concerns.

According to Monti, this is the first time that the E.U. and U.S. antitrust authorities have come to different decisions involving a case in the same product market, though in the past the two bodies' thinking has differed in relation to decisions involving global markets.
"This is a rare case where two well-intentioned authorities have not come to the same conclusion," he said. "It
(the decision) does represent a divergence. But it's not to say that one is right and the other wrong."

The European Union's 20-member Executive  Commission plans to vote Tuesday on General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last-minute proposals or withdrawal of the merger, EU officials said Monday.
The EU is widely expected to  reject the deal at its meeting in Strasbourg, France.
Although sources close to the talks said the companies have been considering withdrawing the application, GE
spokesman Gary Sheffer said Monday, "There are no plans for withdrawal."

Experts said a withdrawal avoids precedent-setting findings that could be used against the companies in some future case.

EU Blocks  Big Merge Between GE, Honeywell.

BRUSSELS, July 3 (Xinhua) - The  European Union (EU) executive branch on Tuesday blocked the General Electric  Co's proposed 43-billion-U.S.-dollar acquisition of  Honeywell  International, the first time the EU has unilaterally killed a  merger approved  by the United States.

The 20-member EU executive took the step over concerns the big  merger would have hurt competition in several aerospace and related markets, a very different conclusion to the U.S. finding in May that only minor changes were needed to win  approval.

GE rejected the European Commission's conclusions. "The facts just don't support these assertions," it said in a statement, adding that the deal "would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices."
Honeywell's reaction was terse. "We are clearly disappointed," a company spokesman said.

The merger negotiations turned into a struggle with GE unwilling to agree to the far-reaching concessions the commission said were needed for it to approve the deal.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the merger between GE and Honeywell "would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines."

But he acknowledged this was the first time the EU and U.S. antitrust agencies have looked at the same facts in the same market and gone different ways.

The EU's review of the case brought scorching criticism from U. S. President George W. Bush and top U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who said EU rejection would be " off the wall."

Several U.S. senators have warned that rejection of the GE deal could hurt U.S.-Europe trade relations or bring retaliation from the United States.

STRASBOURG, FRANCE - THE  EUROPEAN UNION BLOCKED  GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.'S $41 BILLION PURCHASE OF  HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. TODAY, THE FIRST TIME A PROPOSED MERGER BETWEEN TWO U.S. COMPANIES HAS BEEN BLOCKED SOLELY BY EUROPEAN REGULATORS.

The veto of one of the world's largest industrial mergers by the EU's 20-member executive  Commission was widely expected after the American companies failed to allay European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engine and avionics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

The Commission's decision was unanimous. It came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.
IBM lays off 1,000 in global services unit

ARMONK, N.Y. - International Business Machines Corp. is laying off about 1,000 workers in its Global Services group because their skills are no longer needed, according to a published report.

The company, based in Armonk, N.Y., said the job cuts were being made to respond to changing client demand and did not reflect a business slowdown, The Wall Street Journal reported today.

Global Services, the consulting and outsourcing arm of the technology giant, is one of IBM's fastest-growing units, It employs about 150,000 workers, with the U.S. division accounting for roughly 40-60 percent. As a whole, IBM has over 315,000 employees worldwide.
Big crop loss feared from wet farm fields
APPLETON - Unusually wet spring weather could mean big crop losses in the Fox Valley.
"This certainly isn't going to be a good year," said Jeff Key, a Winnebago County agriculture agent.

Some crops still are not planted because the ground is wet from the rain, and many that were planted did not properly germinate. The area gets an average of 2.82 inches of rain in May. This year, the area got 4.69 inches, the National Weather Service office in Green Bay reported. June also was wetter than normal.
Losses for corn and soybeans could reach $6 million in Winnebago County.

About 80 percent of Wisconsin farmers surveyed last week by the Wisconsin Agricultural Statistics Service said their fields were too wet.
Workers go on strike at state Huffy plant
SUSSEX - Huffy Sports plant workers went on strike over health insurance, overtime and pension issues.

About 125 workers represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Lodge 66 walked off the job Monday, said Bill Christiansen, deputy director for the union's District 10.

Seventy non-union employees have been used to keep up production, said Bob Stead, the firm's vice president of human resources.

Stead said the offer included increases in wages and pension but asked workers to pay more of the cost of providing health insurance. But Christiansen said the union balked at the idea of increasing employees' contributions and wanted higher pension benefits.

NANETTE HANSEN, anchor: It is decision day for the European Union. The 20-member executive commission scheduled to vote this morning on  GE's $43 billion bid for Honeywell  International. If the EU rejects the deal, as expected, it would be the first time a proposed  merger between two US companies has been squashed solely by European regulators. Joining us now from Strasbourg, France, with the latest details is CNBC's Leslie Laroche.
Leslie, what's happening where you are? Good morning. LESLIE LAROCHE reporting:
Well, good morning, Nanette. We're here in Strasbourg because the European Parliament is meeting here today. And because they're meeting here, so is the European Commission. And it is at that commission meeting that Mario Monti is expected to put forward his formal recommendation that the--what we expect, is that the
GE-Honeywell deal be blocked. And then the 20 members of that commission are expected to vote and decide.

Now GE and Honeywell still have a couple of hours where they can formally pull their application for consideration of that merger if they so choose, but they must do that before the meeting starts.

Now in other news, The Wall Street Journal is reporting today that the Honeywell board plans to oust the chairman and CEO Bonsignore today at a board meeting if, indeed, this deal with GE does die. And what Honeywell's board is expected to do is to put in place Lawrence Bossidy, who is the former chairman and CEO of AlliedSignal, in place of Bonsignore. That's the latest from Strasbourg. Nanette, back to you.

Union set to vote on 29bn pound Honeywell  bid

THE European Union's 20-member executive  commission was today considering the fate of  General Electric's GBP 29 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International, with both observers and the companies themselves expecting a veto.

The EU's veto of the deal had been widely predicted after the companies failed in their bid to allay  European concerns that the massive  merger would have left  GE in an unfairly dominant position in the markets for jetliner engines and avionics.

Today's vote comes nine months after the takeover was first proposed and a rejection would leave GE with the possibility of either challenging the decision in court or filing a new application and starting the process all over again.
Abide

The chances of GE submitting a revised proposal are small after GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell on Friday. GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.

To do business in Europe, US companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by US law to do business in America. But the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from US antitrust authorities has raised American hackles.

US senators warned of a possible "chilling effect" on trans- Atlantic relations. Even President George W. Bush expressed concern. EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust co-operation is generally good. As evidence, competition commissioner Mario Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close co operation between the agencies.

Of nearly 400 cases involving US companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal - WorldCom-Sprint - was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.

GE remains a healthy company with or without the appendage of Honeywell. It announced a 16 per cent rise in full year profits in April, and its share price has tended to rise on speculation that the deal will be blocked.

"GE remains confident that 2001, with or without Honeywell, will be another record year of double digit operating earnings growth," the firm said in a statement.

Honeywell, however, reported a dramatic slump in profits of 92 per cent in April and was forced to cut 6500 jobs. And the firm partially blamed the proposed merger for its demise, saying it had delayed selling underperforming business units that it had previously planned to ditch.
Reports today said Honeywell would oust its embattled chairman and chief executive, Michael Bonsignore. The reports said the board is expected to name Lawrence Bossidy as new chairman and chief executive. Mr
Bossidy is the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal, which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and
adopted the Honeywell name.

The reports said Mr Bossidy had been asked by the board to accept a one-year contract with a mission of either fixing Honeywell or selling it to another buyer.

The board is apparently leaning towards keeping Honeywell independent and letting Mr Bossidy pick a qualified successor.

Report on Business: The Wall Street Journal
GE merger problems rooted in postwar  history Deal with Honeywell,  likely doomed, shows differing U.S.,
EU antitrust outlooks

Antitrust cops in Europe and the United States work the same beat, but they don't always patrol the streets the same way.

That is clear from the attempted  merger of General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc.  European      regulators tend to worry first of all about whether the merger will hurt business competition. Their American counterparts tend to focus on whether it will hurt consumers.

Today, the European Commission is scheduled to make a final decision on the $42-billion (U.S.) GE-Honeywell deal at a meeting in Strasbourg, France. There is little expectation that European regulators will withdraw their antitrust objections and approve the merger. That leaves the much larger question of how regulators from similar free-market democracies arrive at such divergent views in the first place.

The answer lies in some powerful forces -- in the way war, peace and recovery have affected the political and economic development of the United States and Europe during the past 50 years.

In the proposed merger, European regulators worried about "bundling," or the potential for GE to use its clout to tie two core products into a single package -- jet engines and Honeywell avionics -- and sell it at a price lower than European competitors could match. The European Commission acknowledged that this may lead to lower prices for customers in the short and medium term, but was worried that it may erode profit margins for GE's rivals and affect competition in the aerospace industry in the long run.

With the GE-Honeywell merger all but dead, corporate executives and government officials are going to be focusing on whether these same kinds of disagreements could arise again. The merger sailed through in the United States with only minor alterations; when it faltered in Europe, current and former U.S. officials from both parties lobbied the EC to change its mind. The case highlights the prospect that antitrust enforcement could become a continuing source of tension between the United States and Europe.

European antitrust policy rose out of the ashes of the Second World War. The German antitrust system had strict legal prohibitions against abuses of dominant position, but the German approach also held that competition was defined by the absence of restrictions on economic freedom.

Europe also began to think of itself as a single market rather than a collection of small ones. At the same time, the Continent's leaders -- West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg -- sought to prevent another war by blocking any one country from controlling the means of war, which were mainly coal and steel then. Key industries that were considered important to European security were to be organized along
Europe-wide rather than national lines.

But by the late 1980s, however, European thinking began to rebel against that idea. European leaders came to think that its industrial giants had failed to produce economic growth and still lagged behind in competition with the United States and Japan. The new approach was to use antitrust policy to assure more competition, in the belief that this was the only way for Europe to stay healthy in global economic fights. Antitrust thinking moved back to its postwar roots: keep many competitors on the field, and the economy will benefit.

In the United States, antitrust thinking has evolved over a different and longer timeline. The policy began taking shape with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. Early U.S. trustbusters weren't concerned so much with mergers but with something that is prominent in today's European worries: interlocking trusts, in which a single company can dominate not just one market niche but several. By the 1980s, a new era of antitrust thought arrived, and the United States began to focus on the effect a merger would have on prices, innovation and product development, rather than the fate of the companies left to compete with the new entity. The focus became how a merger affected the consumer, not how it affected the competitive balance between business rivals.

EU Text on Veto of GE-Honeywell  Deal
By The Associated Press
865 words
3 July 2001
AP Online
ASP
English
Copyright 2001 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
The following is the text of the European Commission's statement explaining its veto of the GE-Honeywell       
merger:

The European Commission has decided to prohibit the proposed acquisition by  General Electric  Co. of Honeywell  Inc. This follows an in-depth investigation in the markets for aero-engines, avionics and other aircraft components and systems. In adopting this decision, the  Commission concluded that the  merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines. However, there were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed," European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said, adding: "I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns."

Mr. Monti also said, in relation to the co-operation with the US antitrust authorities: "The European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice have worked in close co-operation during this investigation. It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions, but each authority has to perform its own assessment and the risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never be totally excluded. This does not mean that one authority is doing a technical analysis and the other pursuing a political goal, as some might pretend, but simply that we might interpret facts differently and forecast the effects of an operation in different ways . The
GE-Honeywell is a rare case where the trans-Atlantic competition authorities have disagreed. I am determined to strengthen our bilateral co-operation in the future to try and reduce this risk further."

GE and Honeywell notified their merger agreement for regulatory clearance in Europe on 5 February this year. On March 1, the Commission started an in-depth investigation which demonstrated that GE alone already had a dominant position in the markets for jet engines for large commercial and large regional aircraft. Its strong market position combined with its financial strength and vertical integration into aircraft leasing were among the factors that led to the finding of GE's dominance in these markets. The investigation also showed that Honeywell is the leading supplier of avionics and non-avionics products, as well as of engines for corporate jets and of engine starters (i.e., a key input in the manufacturing of engines).

The combination of the two companies' activities would have resulted in the creation of dominant positions in the markets for the supply of avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines, as well as to the strengthening of GE's existing dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets. The dominance would
have been created or strengthened as a result of horizontal overlaps in some markets as well as through the extension of GE's financial power and vertical integration to Honeywell activities and of the combination of their respective complementary products. Such integration would enable the merged entity to leverage the respective market power of the two companies into the products of one another. This would have the effect of foreclosing competitors, thereby eliminating competition in these markets, ultimately affecting adversely product quality, service and consumers' prices.

On 14 June, GE proposed a number of undertakings intended to address these concerns which were considered insufficient to remove the competition problems identified by the Commission. On 28 June, well beyond the deadline for the submission of undertakings, GE proposed a new set of remedies. This new package could not be accepted either, because it did not resolve the problems identified in a sufficiently clear way at such a very late stage in the procedure.

Given the nature of the competition concerns resulting from the proposed merger and the fact that the GE was unable to propose undertakings that would have removed all competition concerns, the Commission had no choice but prohibit the merger.
Background on EU merger control
This is only the 15th time the Commission has blocked a merger since September 1990, when it became the
one-stop shop for mergers and acquisitions requiring regulatory approval in the European Economic Area - the 15
European Union states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. And it is only the second time it prohibits a
merger involving only American firms.

The Commission has authority to review all mergers, acquisitions and takeover bids and other deals that can be defined as a 'concentration,' involving companies with a combined turnover worldwide in excess of 5 billion euros and European sales of at least 250 million euros for at least two of the companies concerned. The key test for assessing mergers in Europe is whether they create or strengthen a dominant position.

European merger control is not about protecting competitors but about ensuring that markets remain sufficiently competitive in the long run so that consumers benefit from sufficient choice, innovation and competitive prices.

Honeywell  CEO Bonsignore Resigns

By LINDA A. JOHNSON AP Business Writer

Copyright 2001 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
NEW YORK (AP) - Michael R. Bonsignore resigned as chairman and chief executive of  Honeywell  International Inc. Tuesday following the EuropeanCommission's rejection of the company's planned $41 billion  merger with General Electric  Co.
Bonsignore, 60, will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal
Corp., which in 1999 acquired  Honeywell  and adopted the  Honeywell  name.

Bossidy, 66, said Honeywell's board wants him to focus on turning the company as a standalone operation, instead of breaking it up, as some analysts had speculated.

The merger agreement with GE is still in effect, but Bossidy said "the Honeywell board is looking at all its options."

"The idea is to stay independent, to get this company back on its feet," Bossidy said, adding that the merger process has been a major distraction for Honeywell and its 120,000 workers.

Some Honeywell assets will probably be sold and jobs cuts are likely, but Bossidy said a more pressing task is to convince employees thinking about leaving the company that they should stay on.
"One of the priorities is to retain people who were otherwise going to leave," he said.

Bossidy faces hefty challenges, however, as Honeywell copes with a new future without General Electric amid a struggling U.S. economy.

Honeywell, which saw first quarter profits fall 92 percent, also said Tuesday that second quarter ongoing earnings will only be 53 to 55 cents per share, below the consensus estimate of 60 cents a share from analysts surveyed
by Thomson Financial/First Call.
With the apparent demise of the GE-Honeywell deal, analysts are looking at Hartford, Conn.-based United
Technologies, the huge manufacturer of helicopters, as a likely Honeywell suitor.

Bossidy didn't rule out the possibility of Honeywell entering into another combination at some point, but said his task is to rebuild the company. He plans to stay on the job about a year.

"I have some heart and soul in this company. I hate to see it frankly in the condition it is in right now. ... I'm not here for a new career, but for a time I can restore stability," Bossidy said.
United Technologies, which makes jet engines and elevators and helped convince the EU to block the
GE-Honeywell merger, had been in talks to merge with Honeywell when GE suddenly came courting and blocked
that deal last fall.
A GE appeal of the European ruling could block any attempt by Honeywell to find another merger partner. GE
hasn't ruled out an appeal.

Nicholas Heymann, an industry analyst with Prudential Securities in New York, said Bossidy would be more likely to sell individual units of the company, breaking it into as many as a dozen pieces. A GE appeal would not
prevent Bossidy from doing that.

Page 76 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"You could end up getting more value from the parts, by a good margin, than you could for the whole mass," Heymann said.
Bossidy, however, said any divestitures Honeywell makes would not cut into its core aerospace business. Honeywell is known for its technology and creativity, but Heymann said that Bonsignore had failed to execute the
financial restructuring required after AlliedSignal acquired Honeywell for $14 billion in December 1999.

The combined company, which kept Honeywell's better-known name, makes equipment for aerospace systems, power generation, transportation and automated controls for homes, factories and other buildings, as well as specialty chemicals, plastics, fibers and other industrial materials.

Bossidy said he was first contacted about taking the top Honeywell job about three weeks ago. He declined comment when asked whether Bonsignore was pressured to resign by Honeywell's board.
"I wasn't involved in those discussions," Bossidy said.

He acknowledged talking with GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch Tuesday morning, before his appointment was announced, but would not tell reporters what was said.
"We just had a general conversation and arranged a golf game," Bossidy quipped.

Bossidy was previously chairman of AlliedSignal and Honeywell after they merged, retiring in April 2000 and handing the reins to Bonsignore, who had been the Minneapolis-based Honeywell's chief executive.

Bonsignore then started an aggressive cost-cutting program and bolstered Honeywell's Internet business strategy.

But after a strong initial quarter, the new Honeywell International announced in June 2000 that second-quarter profits would fall below expectations. Bonsignore blamed surging raw material prices, a weakened euro and pockets of slow economic activity.

By this April, as the economic slowdown took hold, sales in key markets continued to slump. The company again cited higher costs, but also blamed decisions to halt some business activities and delay plans to sell its consumer automotive products and friction materials businesses because of its pending merger with General Electric.
Since spring, Honeywell has eliminated nearly 6,500 jobs, or about 5 percent of its work force.

Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's on Tuesday affirmed its "stable" ratings outlook for Honeywell, saying the company has "substantial operating diversity, solid competitive positions, a strong financial profile, and a moderate financial policy."
Honeywell shares closed up 99 cents at $35.10 on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday.

EU Blocks  $41B GE-Honeywell Merger

By ALAN CLENDENNING AP Business Writer

3 July 2001

NEW YORK (AP) - Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. on
Tuesday, though GE chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the rejection a "setback."
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission. The ruling was widely expected after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
"We will consider all of our options," Sheffer said.

Hours after the EU's veto, Honeywell took steps to move forward, however, announcing that chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore had resigned and saying it expected to remain an independent company.
Bonsignore will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal
Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.

An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the Commission since 1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far have been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the Commission, one was withdrawn, and two are still pending.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the Commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

Welch's choice of words left analysts predicting GE was still trying to find a way to get approval for the combination. But they said the odds were against a successful appeal.
"I think they're very slim," said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group.
A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination said a
GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal, but to limit the decision's impact on the company's ability to
do business in Europe.

"Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedental value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe," said the lawyer, John Briggs, of Howrey, Simon, Arnold & White LLP in Washington, D.C.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, still plans on retiring by the end of this year, though the exact timing was unclear.

"Jack has said he would retire at the conclusion of this process. That's unchanged. When he's ready to go, he will go," Sheffer said.



Page 78 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Late Tuesday, Honeywell's Bossidy said the merger agreement with GE is still in effect, but that "the Honeywell board is looking at all its options."

He made it clear that his mandate is to turn Honeywell around as a standalone company, saying one of his main tasks would be to "try to encourage people to forget the past and forget what might have been and refocus on tomorrow."

A statement from the Commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but "the remedies proposed ... were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was modified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

The Commission concluded the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's "dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets."

The unanimous decision came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.
In its statement, GE said the company was "deeply disappointed" with the outcome.

"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," the statement said.

Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane said, "We're disappointed in their decision," referring to the European commission's veto.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

However, the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities has raised American hackles.

U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible "chilling effect" on trans-Atlantic relations. Even President Bush expressed concern.

EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust cooperation is generally good. As evidence, Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation between the agencies.

Monti said U.S. and European regulators regularly consult on their respective investigations of corporate linkups. While the they usually come to similar verdicts, the "risk of dissenting views ... can never be totally excluded," he said.

Still, dissension is rare. Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal - WorldCom-Sprint - was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.

Last Friday GE rejected last-ditch revisions in the deal suggested by Honeywell that would have also pared more than $1 billion from the takeover price. In return for lower purchase price, Honeywell asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.
Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

GE shares fell 69 cents to close at $49.51 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Honeywell shares gained 99 cents to close at $35.10.

GE's Bid to Purchase Honeywell  Expected to Be Retracted Soon Merger: With the EC apparently poised
to reject it, the two firms might withdraw their proposal.

General Electric  Co.'s bid for  Honeywell  International was near death Monday and the only remaining drama was whether the companies would withdraw the deal before the  European Commission kills it today.

The two companies have been "actively considering" withdrawal of the $42-billion transaction late Monday or early today, sources close to the talks said.  GE had no comment on the matter.

The 20-member European Commission has scheduled a vote for this afternoon in Strasbourg, France, where everyone involved--including the companies--expects the merger to be rejected.

Commission experts have argued that a merged GE and Honeywell would enjoy an unfair advantage over rivals in the markets for large civil aircraft and avionics.

It's logical for the companies to choose to withdraw instead of facing a negative vote, experts said. They said a withdrawal--which is what usually happens in cases like this--avoids precedent-setting findings that could be used against the companies in some future case.

Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said a merger may be withdrawn at any time but noted: "We need to have a formal withdrawal. It is not sufficient to make an announcement." She also said the issue was on the agenda for today's commission meeting.

The last chance to save the deal evaporated Friday when GE Chief Executive Jack Welch rejected a last-minute suggestion by his counterpart at Honeywell, Michael Bonsignore, to slash $1.7 billion from the price to compensate GE for divestitures needed to win Commission approval for the merger.

Two weeks ago, GE offered to sell assets that generate $2.2 billion in revenue and separate the management and accounts of its aircraft leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, or Gecas, from the rest of the company. That fell short of regulators' demands.

Commissioner Mario Monti also wanted GE to divest a piece of Gecas to competitors Rolls-Royce or Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp., according to a document obtained by Reuters.

On Friday, Bonsignore was ready to agree to everything the commission wanted to get the deal done, but Welch was not.

Shares of Honeywell sank Friday on the news of the exchange between Welch and Bonsignore, dropping $3.21, or 8.4%, to $34.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, their lowest close since Oct. 18, five days before the deal with GE was announced. On Monday, Honeywell shares fell 79 cents to $34.11.
Shares of GE, which Friday fell 12 cents to $48.75, rose $1.20 to $50.20 on the NYSE. Document latm000020010712dx73013y0

NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) -  Honeywell  International Inc. late Tuesday said its board ousted Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Bonsignore, replacing him with former AlliedSignal chief Lawrence Bossidy just hours after European regulators killed the company's  merger with General Electric  Co.
The management change takes effect immediately, and  Honeywell  noted it expects to implement a strategy to
"enhance shareowner value as an independent company."

Honeywell, whose products range from aircraft electronics to home security systems, also said ongoing earnings in the second quarter would be in the range of 53 cents to 55 cents per share, excluding a charge, on revenues of
$6 billion - meeting the low end of analysts' current estimates.

Bossidy, 66, had served briefly as Honeywell's chief following the 1999 acquisition of Honeywell by AlliedSignal, and then handed the reins to Bonsignore, 60. AlliedSignal adopted the Honeywell name following the deal.
Earlier Tuesday, the European Commission voted to block General Electric's proposed $42 billion acquisition of
Honeywell.

NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) -  Honeywell  International Inc. late on Tuesday said its former Chairman Lawrence Bossidy would replace Michael Bonsignore as chairman and chief executive, just hours after  European                regulators killed the company's  merger with General Electric  Co.

Honeywell  said it expects to implement a strategy meant to "enhance shareowner value as an independent company." The management change takes effect immediately.
Honeywell, whose products range from aircraft electronics to home security systems, also said it expects
on-going earnings per share for the full year to range from $2.15 per share to $2.30 per share - at the lower end
of the range of Wall Street analysts' targets.

"It is time to leave behind the distractions of the past several months and to immediately implement a laser-sharp focus on consistently meeting our financial commitments and our customers' needs," Bossidy said in a prepared statement.
The announcement comes hours after the European Commission rejected GE's proposed $42 billion purchase of
Honeywell, citing antitrust concerns.

Bossidy, 66, served as Chairman and CEO of AlliedSignal from 1991 to 1999, when he became Chairman of Honeywell following the merger of the two companies. AlliedSignal adopted the Honeywell name following the deal.
OUTLOOK

Honeywell said it expects to record a second-quarter pre-tax charge of $575 million to $625 million related primarily to repositioning, customer settlements, asset impairments, merger-related expenses, legal and environmental costs, Honeywell said.

Excluding that charge, second-quarter ongoing earnings should be in the range of 53 cents to 55 cents per share, the company said. Revenues should total $6 billion.

Analysts, on average pegged Honeywell at a profit of 60 cents per share for the second quarter, with estimates ranging from as low as 48 cents up to 70 cents per share, according to tracking firm Thomson Financial/First Call.
For the full year, Honeywell said it should report earnings of $2.15 per share to $2.30 per share.
Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $2.46 per share with estimates ranging from $2.10 to $2.70. Document lba0000020010912dx7300b1z

UPDATE 5-EU blocks  GE's takeover of Honeywell.

NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - The  European Commission blocked General Electric  Co.'s $42 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. on Tuesday, marking the first time European regulators have killed a merger     approved  by their counterparts in the United States.

The European Union's 20-member executive arm took the bold step after voicing concerns the deal would have hurt competition in several aerospace and related markets - a conclusion that was strikingly different than the U.S. finding that only minor changes were needed to clear the deal.
GE countered the Commission's conclusions, saying not only that it was disappointed but that it disagreed. "The facts just don't support these assertions," GE said in a prepared statement. "We believe this acquisition
would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service, and prices."
The reaction from Honeywell was terse. "We are clearly disappointed," a company spokesman said.

Shares of Honeywell, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, have fallen over the last week to trade at levels unseen since the GE deal was first announced last fall. The stock rose 99 cents to $35.10 in Tuesday's trading session, which was shortened ahead of the Independence Day holiday.

The merger would have combined two of the largest U.S. conglomerates with businesses ranging from aerospace and engines to financial services, broadcasting, and power systems.

GE, the world's largest company by stock market capitalization, generated $25 billion in revenues from European operations last year. That represents just less than 20 percent of its total $129.85 billion in 2000 revenues.
The company also employs 85,000 people in Europe out of a total worldwide work force of 313,000. Negotiations over the merger turned into a titanic struggle with GE unwilling to agree to the far-reaching
concessions the Commission said were needed for it to approve the deal.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti acknowledged this was the first time the European Union and U.S. antitrust agencies have looked at the same facts in the same market and gone different ways.

"I, for one, am genuinely interested in understanding better why this divergence occurred," Monti told a news conference in Strasbourg where the Commission made its decision.
EVERYONE'S A CRITIC

The Commission's review of the case brought scorching criticism from President George W. Bush and top U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who said EU rejection would be "off the wall."

Late Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said the EU's decision reflected a significant divergence between the two antitrust enforcers, showing a need for consultation to "move toward greater policy convergence."

Several U.S. senators warned that rejection of the GE deal could hurt U.S.-European trade relations or bring retaliation from the United States.

Page 84 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Monti tried to ease the impact, pointing out that this was only the 15th time in over a decade the Commission had blocked a merger and lavishly praising GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch: "He is not an American icon, he is a world icon."

He also stressed his determination to strengthen EU-U.S. cooperation in the competition field to reduce the risk of future disputes. But that did not lessen the reality of the Commission's findings.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," Monti said.

Analysts and antitrust lawyers, however, have noted that regulators in Brussels considered the views of industry rivals in their review of the transaction while regulators in Washington weighed the interests of consumers.

"The Commission took a fundamentally different approach to competitive issues than its counterparts in the U.S., Canada, and nearly a dozen other jurisdictions, which approved the acquisition with few, if any, conditions," GE said in its statement.

The decision leaves Honeywell with an uncertain future. The company spent nine months anticipating it would be integrated into GE's operations, in which time Honeywell management has not been thinking strategically, Wall Street analysts said.

On Tuesday, Honeywell's board met behind closed doors and was widely expected to announce that chief executive Michael Bonsignore would be replaced by Larry Bossidy, former head of AlliedSignal, the company that bought Honeywell in 1999.
AlliedSignal kept the Honeywell name after that merger. THE DEAL BREAKER
An impasse over GE's aircraft leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), appeared to be the deal breaker, sources said. The operation buys, sells, and leases aircraft.

The Commission alleged that GE used the GECAS division to help sell its engines to aircraft customers. Commission experts also said GE would be able to bundle its engines with Honeywell's avionics systems.
To close the deal, Monti requested GE sell assets that generate more than $6 billion in revenues.

The commissioner also wanted GE to sell a stake in the GECAS unit to rivals Rolls-Royce Plc and Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. , according to a document obtained by Reuters.
GE, however, proposed only to sell $2.2 billion in assets.

In a late move, the company said it would agree to sell 19.9 percent of GECAS in a private transaction, but not to competitors and only in exchange for a significant reduction in the amount of assets it would need to divest.
That final offer was rejected by the Commission. WELCH'S VALEDICTION
The defeat was a major disappointment for GE's Welch, who delayed his departure from the company to see the deal through. But one Wall Street analyst said the decision might make life easier for his successor, Jeffrey Immelt.

"GE's going to do fine with or without Honeywell," said William Fiala of Edward Jones. "Honeywell was an opportunistic acquisition. It was driven in part by the defensive nature of (rival bidder) United Technologies trying to buy Honeywell."

"So, it's partly bad for GE, but they have a great business portfolio and this probably makes Jeff Immelt's succession easier," Fiala said.

The reaction from Honeywell was terse. "We are clearly disappointed," a company spokesman said.

Shares of Honeywell, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, have fallen over the last week to trade at levels unseen since the GE deal was first announced last fall. The stock rose 99 cents to $35.10 in Tuesday's trading session, which was shortened ahead of the Independence Day holiday.

The merger would have combined two of the largest U.S. conglomerates with businesses ranging from aerospace and engines to financial services, broadcasting, and power systems.

GE, the world's largest company by stock market capitalization, generated $25 billion in revenues from European operations last year. That represents just less than 20 percent of its total $129.85 billion in 2000 revenues.
The company also employs 85,000 people in Europe out of a total worldwide work force of 313,000. Negotiations over the merger turned into a titanic struggle with GE unwilling to agree to the far-reaching
concessions the Commission said were needed for it to approve the deal.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti acknowledged this was the first time the European Union and U.S. antitrust agencies have looked at the same facts in the same market and gone different ways.

"I, for one, am genuinely interested in understanding better why this divergence occurred," Monti told a news conference in Strasbourg where the Commission made its decision.
EVERYONE'S A CRITIC

The Commission's review of the case brought scorching criticism from President George W. Bush and top U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who said EU rejection would be "off the wall."

Late Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said the EU's decision reflected a significant divergence between the two antitrust enforcers, showing a need for consultation to "move toward greater policy convergence."

Several U.S. senators warned that rejection of the GE deal could hurt U.S.-European trade relations or bring retaliation from the United States.

Monti tried to ease the impact, pointing out that this was only the 15th time in over a decade the Commission had blocked a merger and lavishly praising GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch: "He is not an American icon, he is a world icon."

He also stressed his determination to strengthen EU-U.S. cooperation in the competition field to reduce the risk of future disputes. But that did not lessen the reality of the Commission's findings.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," Monti said.

Analysts and antitrust lawyers, however, have noted that regulators in Brussels considered the views of industry rivals in their review of the transaction while regulators in Washington weighed the interests of consumers.

"The Commission took a fundamentally different approach to competitive issues than its counterparts in the U.S., Canada, and nearly a dozen other jurisdictions, which approved the acquisition with few, if any, conditions," GE said in its statement.

The decision leaves Honeywell with an uncertain future. The company spent nine months anticipating it would be integrated into GE's operations, in which time Honeywell management has not been thinking strategically, Wall Street analysts said.

On Tuesday, Honeywell's board met behind closed doors and was widely expected to announce that chief executive Michael Bonsignore would be replaced by Larry Bossidy, former head of AlliedSignal, the company that bought Honeywell in 1999.
AlliedSignal kept the Honeywell name after that merger. THE DEAL BREAKER
An impasse over GE's aircraft leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), appeared to be the deal breaker, sources said. The operation buys, sells, and leases aircraft.

The Commission alleged that GE used the GECAS division to help sell its engines to aircraft customers. Commission experts also said GE would be able to bundle its engines with Honeywell's avionics systems.
To close the deal, Monti requested GE sell assets that generate more than $6 billion in revenues.

The commissioner also wanted GE to sell a stake in the GECAS unit to rivals Rolls-Royce Plc and Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp., according to a document obtained by Reuters.
GE, however, proposed only to sell $2.2 billion in assets.

In a late move, the company said it would agree to sell 19.9 percent of GECAS in a private transaction, but not to competitors and only in exchange for a significant reduction in the amount of assets it would need to divest.
That final offer was rejected by the Commission. WELCH'S VALEDICTION
The defeat was a major disappointment for GE's Welch, who delayed his departure from the company to see the deal through. But one Wall Street analyst said the decision might make life easier for his successor, Jeffrey Immelt.

"GE's going to do fine with or without Honeywell," said William Fiala of Edward Jones. "Honeywell was an opportunistic acquisition. It was driven in part by the defensive nature of (rival bidder) United Technologies trying to buy Honeywell."

"So, it's partly bad for GE, but they have a great business portfolio and this probably makes Jeff Immelt's succession easier," Fiala said.

FULL TEXT-EU statement  on GE-Honeywell.
867 words
3 July 2001

Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, July 3 (Reuters) - Following is a full text of the European Commission news release on its decision on Tuesday to block  General Electric  Co's proposed $43 billion acquisition of Honeywell  International .

The European Commission has decided to prohibit the proposed acquisition by  General Electric  Co. of Honeywell  Inc. This follows an in-depth investigation in the markets for aero-engines, avionics and other aircraft components and systems. In adopting this decision, the  Commission concluded that the  merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines. However, there were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed," European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said, adding: "I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns."

Mr Monti also said, in relation to the cooperation with the U.S. antitrust authorities: "The European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice have worked in close cooperation during this investigation. It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions, but each authority has to perform its own assessment and the risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never be totally excluded. This does not mean that one authority is doing a technical analysis and the other pursuing a political goal, as some might pretend, but simply that we might interpret facts differently and forecast the effects of an operation in different ways. The GE/Honeywell is a rare case where the transatlantic competition authorities have disagreed. I am determined to strenghten our bilateral cooperation in the future to try and reduce this risk further."

GE and Honeywell notified their merger agreement for regulatory clearance in Europe on 5 February this year. On March 1, the Commission started an in-depth investigation which demonstrated that GE alone already had a dominant position in the markets for jet engines for large commercial and large regional aircraft. Its strong market position combined with its financial strength and vertical integration into aircraft leasing were among the factors that led to the finding of GE's dominance in these markets. The investigation also showed that Honeywell is the leading supplier of avionics and non-avionics products, as well as of engines for corporate jets and of engine starters (i.e., a key input in the manufacturing of engines).

The combination of the two companies' activities would have resulted in the creation of dominant positions in the markets for the supply of avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines, as well as to the strengthening of GE's existing dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets. The dominance would
have been created or strengthened as a result of horizontal overlaps in some markets as well as through the extension of GE's financial power and vertical integration to Honeywell activities and of the combination of their respective complementary products. Such integration would enable the merged entity to leverage the respective market power of the two companies into the products of one another. This would have the effect of foreclosing competitors, thereby eliminating competition in these markets, ultimately affecting adversely product quality, service and consumers' prices.

On 14 June, GE proposed a number of undertakings intended to address these concerns which were considered insufficient to remove the competition problems identified by the Commission. On 28 June, well beyond the deadline for the submission of undertakings, GE proposed a new set of remedies. This new package could not be accepted either, because it did not resolve the problems identified in a sufficiently clear way at such a very late stage in the procedure.

Page 91 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Given the nature of the competition concerns resulting from the proposed merger and the fact that the GE was unable to propose undertakings that would have removed all competition concerns, the Commission had no choice but prohibit the merger.
Background on EU merger control
This is only the 15th time the Commission has blocked a merger since September 1990, when it became the
one-stop shop for mergers and acquisitions requiring regulatory approval in the European Economic Area - the 15
European Union states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. And it is only the second time it prohibits a
merger involving only American firms.

The Commission has authority to review all mergers, acquisitions and takeover bids and other deals that can be defined as a 'concentration', involving companies with a combined turnover worldwide in excess of 5.0 billion euros and European sales of at least 250 million euros for at least two of the companies concerned.

The key test for assessing mergers in Europe is whether they create or strengthen a dominant position. European merger control is not about protecting competitors but about ensuring that markets remain sufficiently competitive in the long run so that consumers benefit from sufficient choice, innovation and competitive prices.

EU Bars GE/Honeywell Merger - Would 'Severely'  Cut Competition.

- Companies' Efforts Fell Short of Easing  Competition Concerns

WASHINGTON (MktNews) - The  European Commission decided Tuesday to prohibit the  merger between General Electric  and Honeywell,  saying the move would "severely" reduce  competition in the aerospace industry, and the companies' efforts to find a solution to the  EU concerns were unsuccessful.

The commission said in a statement that the merger "would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell."

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said, "The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines."

While Monti said in the statement that "there were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed," he added, "I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns."

Monti said the commission worked closely with the U.S. Department of Justice looking at the anti-trust concerns with the merger, but in the end reached different conclusions.

"The GE/Honeywell is a rare case where the transatlantic competition authorities have disagreed. I am determined to strengthen our bilateral co-operation in the future to try and reduce this risk further," Monti said.
This is only the second time the commission has blocked a merger involving only American firms.

The commission expressed concern over the dominant position the new company would have had in the markets for the supply of avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines, as well as to the strengthening of GE's existing dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets.

This "would have the effect of foreclosing competitors, thereby eliminating competition in these markets, ultimately affecting adversely product quality, service and consumers' prices."

MESSY LEGACY OF GE CHIEF'S MERGER MISCALCULATION.

(c) 2001
Unless General Electric  withdraws its $42 billion (#30 billion) takeover offer for Honeywell,  the European           Commission is expected today formally to back Competition Commissioner Mario Monti's decision to block
the deal. And a good thing too. The evidence was overwhelming that GE would have tried to use  Honeywell's avionics capacity and its own leading position in the financing and manufacture of jet engines to weaken competition in an already highly-concentrated market.

But what a mess this abortive mega-bid will leave behind. In an impressive analysis yesterday the Wall Street Journal painted a picture of  Honeywell,  which itself merged almost two years ago with industrial conglomerate Allied Signal, as a company in crisis. Before the deal with  GE was struck, Honeywell  was suffering not only from a slump in some of its key (formerly Allied Signal) businesses such as car parts and specialty chemicals, but also from a clash of cultures at the top.

Allied Signal boss Lawrence Bossidy, himself a former top GE executive, was running a company that focused on short-term earnings while Honeywell, headed by Michael Bonsignore, believed in building long-term customer relations with the likes of Boeing.

The intervention of GE appears to have made things worse. Even before it was the legal owner, GE seems to have been calling the shots at Honeywell in the belief that the transaction was a done deal. With US anti-trust authorities bowing to the political clout of GE's chief executive Jack Welch and waving the merger through, it must have looked just like that. Welch, it seems, gave too little thought to the fact that Europe has its own competition laws.

Welch has tried to bully the European Commission into rolling over like Washington's competition authorities, even getting President Bush to raise the issue at the Gothenburg summit last month. This may be a testimony to Welch's political connections but, as the GE share price suggests, it also indicates how badly GE needs an industrial deal as GE Finance bulks ever larger in its corporate profile. So far as his reputation is concerned, Welch may have left his imminent retirement a few months too late.

EU Commission set to vote Tuesday on  GE Honeywell

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The  European Union's 20-member executive  Commission plans to vote Tuesday on General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last minute proposals or withdrawal of the  merger, EU officials said yesterday.
The EU is widely expected to reject the deal at its meeting in Strasbourg, France.

EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres said, "If the merger notification remains on the table, the Commission will have to make a decision. She noted, however, that merger approval applications can be withdrawn by the companies at "at any time."
"There are no plans for withdrawal," GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said yesterday. .

Should the merger were to be officially rejected Tuesday, GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again, EU officials said.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

The chances that GE will submit a revised proposal are dim, after GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell on Friday. GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.

The European Union's 20-member executive  Commission plans to vote today on  General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last minute proposals or withdrawal of the  merger, EU officials said Monday.
The EU is widely expected to  reject the deal at its meeting in Strasbourg, France.
"It's on the agenda, and they will vote Tuesday (today)," said EU spokesman Michael Tscherny.

EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres said, "If the merger notification remains on the table, the Commission will have to make a decision." She noted, however, that merger approval applications can be withdrawn by the companies at "at any time."
"There are no plans for withdrawal," GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said Monday.
In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares were up $1.20, closing at $50.20, while
Honeywell shares were down 79 cents, closing at $34.11.

If the merger were to be officially rejected today, GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again, EU officials said.

In an impressive analysis yesterday the Wall Street Journal painted a picture of  Honeywell,  which itself merged almost two years ago with industrial conglomerate Allied Signal, as a company in crisis. Before the deal with  GE was struck, Honeywell  was suffering not only from a slump in some of its key (formerly Allied Signal) businesses such as car parts and specialty chemicals, but also from a clash of cultures at the top.

Allied Signal boss Lawrence Bossidy, himself a former top GE executive, was running a company that focused on short-term earnings while Honeywell, headed by Michael Bonsignore, believed in building long-term customer relations with the likes of Boeing.

The intervention of GE appears to have made things worse. Even before it was the legal owner, GE seems to have been calling the shots at Honeywell in the belief that the transaction was a done deal.

With US antitrust authorities bowing to the political clout of GE's chief executive Jack Welch and waving the merger through, it must have looked just like that. Welch, it seems, gave too little thought to the fact that Europe has its own competition laws.

Welch has tried to bully the European Commission into rolling over like Washington's competition authorities, even getting President Bush to raise the issue at the Gothenburg summit last month.

This may be a testimony to Welch's political connections but, as the GE share price suggests, it also indicates how badly GE needs an industrial deal as GE Finance bulks ever larger in its corporate profile. So far as his reputation is concerned, Welch may have left his imminent retirement a few months too late.
Off the rails

IT WOULD have been funny, were it not tragic, to see new Transport Secretary Stephen Byers proudly claim credit last week for giving "12 draft directions" to the Strategic Rail Authority which he said, gave it "a routemap." In my naivet I thought routemaps and direction were what the SRA had been created to provide for the rail industry.
I did not realise it was purely a post-box for the whims and prejudices of the middle-ranking civil servants briefing
Byers.

Of greater concern, though, is the latest fetish of rail regulator Tom Winsor. He thinks it would help to fine someone every time a train is late.

Some say fines could hit Pounds 100 million this year and it is hard to imagine a worse use for the money generated by this cash-strapped industry. It is also exceedingly dangerous because it will inevitably put additional pressure on frontline managers to cut corners. Not a good idea when you are pulling a train.

There would be outrage if such a regime were imposed on airlines.

They could legitimately blame the weather, air traffic control congestion or a fault on the flight deck for a delayed departure, but the same is true, with slightly different emphasis, on the railways. And would anyone endorse a system that put pressure on a pilot to take off regardless of the conditions rather than risk being late? They would not - so why should anyone think it is a good idea for the railways?

GE move for Honeywell  vetoed by EC

THE European Commission today vetoed  General Electric's  plans to take over  Honeywell  amid concerns that the combined power of the two US firms would dominate the aircraft industry, write Edward Lowry and Lauren Chambliss.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell  would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," said EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

The decision threatens to sour already tense political relations between Brussels and Washington, whose antitrust regulators had given the venture a conditional green light in May.

It also leaves the reputation of GE chairman Jack Welsh battered and bruised, but the biggest loser is Honeywell, whose directors were today addressing an uncertain future and considering a management upheaval.

Honeywell's board was widely expected to oust chief executive Michael Bon-signore, paving the way for the company to be sold off.

Newscast:  European Union formally rejects GE-Honeywell merger
524 words
3 July 2001
CNBC: Business Center
BCTR
English
(c) Copyright 2001, CNBC, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
SUE HERERA, co-anchor: Sharon mentioned the  GE-Honeywell  deal. Well, it comes as the United States is about to celebrate the anniversary of its independence from Europe. Europe's formal rejection of General Electric's  bid to merge with  Honeywell  came today. The announcement marks the first time a merger between two American companies has been blocked by  European regulators alone. A statement from GE, the parent of this c--network, said in part, quote, "We are deeply disappointed by today's decision. We strongly disagree with the commission's conclusions," end quote.

Leslie ro--LaRoche of CNBC  Europe joins us now from Strasbourg, France, where that decision was announced earlier today. Leslie.
LESLIE LaROCHE reporting:
Well, thank you, Sue. Yeah, Mario Monti was be--was able to deliver basically a unanimous decision to block the
GE-Honeywell deal. That was a--the resolution from the European Commission today.

Let me walk you through some of the objections that he raised. He's saying that the combination of GE and Honeywell would have created dominance in markets for the supply of a--avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines. He went on to say that the combination would strengthen GE's existing dominance in jet engines for
large commercial and large regional jets. Well, it's not over; he also said that the deal would have created or strengthened horizontal overlaps through the extension of GE's financial power.

So clearly, there were a lot of objections, not able through the remedies and the proposal procedure, to come to any a--agreeable terms. But Mario Monti defended his decision this way.

Mr. MARIO MONTI (EU Competition Commissioner): Adopting this decision, the commission concluded that the merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets, and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell.

LaROCHE: Now Mario Monti went out of his way to say that nationalities didn't play any part in this decision, and he--and he said that he basically heard complaints from US and European competitors and customers. He did also go out of his way to praise Jack Welch, calling him a charismatic world icon. But he said that he had to be sensitive to the European impact of this deal, and called that--the decision for the Europeans to block this deal an unfortunate trans-Atlantic divergence. He said he did not think he was taking part in any historic decision.
That is the latest from Strasbourg. Back to you, Ron and Sue. HERERA: Thank you very much, Leslie.
Let's check the stocks of the former merger partners. (Graphic on screen)

Newscast:  European Commission blocks  GE-Honeywell merger
625 words
3 July 2001
CNBC: Business Center
BCTR
English
(c) Copyright 2001, CNBC, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
RON INSANA, co-anchor: Well, the European Commission indeed officially blocked the proposed $43 billion merger of CNBC's parent company, General Electric,  and fellow Dow component Honeywell.  The rejection of the deal marks the first time Europeans  have killed a merger already approved  in the US. European regulators say the deal would have created competition problems in several aerospace and related markets.

Mr. MARIO  MONTI (EU Competition Commissioner): The combination of the two companies' activities would have resulted in the creation of dominant positions in the markets for the supply of av--avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines, as well as in the strengthening of  GE's existing dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets.

INSANA: General Electric issued a statement on the European decision, saying, `We are deeply disappointed by today's decision. The commission took a fundamentally different approach to competitive issues than its counterparts in the US, Canada and nearly a dozen other jurisdictions, which approved the acquisition with few, if any, conditions.' GE also says it disagrees with the commission's conclusions about the competitive effects of the acquisition. CNBC's Hampton Pearson has more on the decision and its fallout.
HAMPTON PEARSON reporting:
Trade experts and international economists say the European Union decision to block the $43 billion
GE-Honeywell merger will have far-reaching consequences.
Mr. PETER MORICI (Economics Strategy Institute): The lasting impacts will be on the chill of mergers of US
companies that do business in Europe and its effects on US trade relations with Europe.

PEARSON: It's the first time a merger of two US-based companies was blocked solely by European regulators. Tough negotiations were complicated by bad political timing. There was not the usual cooperation between European and American antitrust officials because the Bush administration had not put its team in place. And
trade experts say GE's last-minute efforts to get the Bush White House involved, plus President Bush's comments during his first visit to Europe, might have backfired.

Ms. PAULA STERN (The Stern Group): I think if the politicians kind of step back and go back into their corners and let the regulators do the economic analysis, applying their own regulations as they had in the past and in the future, I don't think it's an insurmountable obstacle for--for merging companies.

PEARSON: The blocked merger might have a dramatic effect on a looming trade fight at the World Trade Organization. In late June, the WTO said certain US tax provisions are really subsidies to major American exporters. The European Union could impose up to $4 billion in sanctions on US goods in retaliation. But analysts think the Europeans will think twice about how aggressively to pursue a massive fine against US companies.

Mr. MORICI: With the foreign sales corporations case coming up, it really pressures the Europeans to reach a political solution there 'cause I don't think they really can afford to put their thumb in the American eye twice in--in the same year.

PEARSON: And the GE-Honeywell fallout also complicates ongoing White House trade talks with the Europeans, and here at home gives new ammunition to those on Capitol Hill who oppose giving President Bush so-called
fast-track trade negotiating authority. Ron.
INSANA: All right, Hampton. Thank you.

Checking on how shares of GE and Honeywell ended the session today, Honeywell moved up about 89 cents, GE fell 80, while United Technologies moved up $1.87 to $72.95

Analysis: Whether Jack Welch of GE will retire now that the Honeywell  deal has fallen through
584 words
3 July 2001
CNBC: Business Center
BCTR
English

SUE HERERA, co-anchor: European antitrust regulators officially rejected General Electric's  proposed $43 billion offer for Honeywell.  It's the first time Europeans  have killed a merger approved  by the US. In the wake of the failed  GE-Honeywell  deal, there is already speculation about its impact on the legacy of  GE's chairman, Jack Welch. Garrett Glaser has been sampling opinions.
GARRETT GLASER reporting:

For many, GE Chairman Jack Welch is the most revered business leader in the world, named Manager of the Century by Fortune magazine; rewarded with a $7 million contract to write his memoirs; the man who took GE's market cap from $13 billion in 1981 to about $490 billion today. But what will this do to the Welch legacy? Reuters speculates today, `The deal, which was to be his last hurrah, looks like it might turn into Welch's Waterloo.'

But will it? Jeffrey Sonnenfeld thinks not. Sonnenfeld is associate dean at Yale School of Management. He runs its chief executive leadership school there for CEOs. One of his books is "The Hero's Farewell: What Happens When CEOs Retire."
Mr. JEFFREY SONNENFELD (Yale School of Management): It shows he's not willing to do a deal at any cost. Secondly, I think it speaks volumes about the tightness of the rapport with his chosen successor, Jeffrey Immelt,
that they really have worked on this as a team. And you'd see some people that--in--in Welch's shoes, that might
leave some real unpleasant baggage for Immelt to inherent.
And, thirdly, for Jack s--Welch's legacy, it s--reminds us the man's human.
GLASER: Bear Stearns analyst John Inch agrees and sees minimal impact on the Welch legacy and on GE.

Mr. JOHN INCH (Bear Stearns): I mean, GE's got, obviously, an awful lot of irons in the fire. I do think insofar as Jack's concerned, you're probably going to see him exit the stage in relatively short order, which is probably what we had already expected, insofar as allowing Jeff Immelt to take full reins of the company and--and--and plow ahead.

GLASER: While Nicholas Heymann at Prudential Financial thinks the Welch reputation is protected because of what he believes the deal could have done to hurt shareholders.

Mr. NICHOLAS HEYMANN (Prudential Financial): I don't think it was damaged. I think, quite honestly, you know, when the terms were, in essence, forced down Jack's throat in the, quote, "offer" that Honeywell voluntarily,
pre-emptively and unilaterally offered, you know, it encouraged Mr. Welch to take in return for a bit lower, you know, exchange ratio on Friday, I think clearly Jack had to call--you know, he called it where he saw it. This was an offer as structured with common stock that ultimately could have reduced the P/E premium that everybody at GE has worked for 20 years to build.

GLASER: In its current issue, Fortune magazine notes that at 65, Welch had long planned to leave GE at the end of last year. Then he said he'd stay on another year, if needed, for the Honeywell integration. Well, since he won't be needed there, will he now leave? Says Fortune, `That ought to be a safe bet.' Then again, Jack Welch may not yet be through with surprises. Garrett Glaser, CNBC BUSINESS CENTER, New York.

Interview: Professor Michael Watkins of Harvard Business School discusses the failure of GE-Honeywell to gain merger approval  from the EU
938 words
3 July 2001
CNBC: Business Center
BCTR
English
(c) Copyright 2001, CNBC, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
RON INSANA, co-anchor: Michael Watkins is a professor at Harvard Business School, where he's an expert in corporate diplomacy, as well as co-author of "Winning the Influence Game." He's helped corporations build coalitions through negotiation. And he joins us now. He has some thoughts that  GE made a few mistakes in Europe. Professor Watkins, good to see you. Thanks for being with us.

Professor MICHAEL WATKINS (Harvard Business School; "Winning the Influence Game" Author): Good to be here.
INSANA: What exactly, in your mind, did GE do wrong?

Prof. WATKINS: Well, it's a variety of things. I think there were some initial missteps right at the conception of the deal, if you will. There was not really a chance for the deal-makers to consult with their European antitrust people, and, frankly, that's not uncommon when you're trying to put together a--a big deal like this. But it really led to
some follow-on problems. They--they got behind the curve pretty early, and then I think they made a class--a couple of classic missteps late in the game that really sealed their fate.
INSANA: Such as?

Prof. WATKINS: Well, I think there's a couple of fatal mistakes you can make in dealing with--with regulators, and one is to try and do end runs around them; to try and, for example, go to the national government regulators in Europe after you've been dealing with the European Commission. And that's a mistake, for example, that Coke made when a--or much earlier when it was trying do to the Orangina acquisition.
And the second big one is, really, to publicly criticize the--the regulating authority, and that's the--what I call the
Microsoft mistake, right? You ge--you don't--you don't win by doing that.

INSANA: Now what about the notion that--an--and, you know, different people have different views on this, though--that--that the European Union did not use kind of standard monopoly philosophy in rejecting deal; that they came up, really, with some relatively new objections to the combination's influence in Europe?

Prof. WATKINS: Well, one person's politics is another's policy is, I guess, the way I would put it. I mean, it really is a little bit in the eye of the beholder here. And there--there's an irony, I think, that the Europeans are turning out to be tougher on competition policy than the US is. I mean, the--the--the funny thing here is that we actually don't mind a monopoly, so long as it doesn't impact prices for customers and so long as it doesn't maintain its
monopoly through--through, you know, anti-competitive conduct. The Europeans don't see it that way for a variety of ideological and historical reasons.

INSANA: Would the combination in Europe, in your mind, have been monopolistic in its various aerospace operations?

Prof. WATKINS: Well, I think that that, again, is in the eyes of the beholder. I think that it would have--would have exerted a lot of power in the industry. There's just no question about it. And when you hear about revelations and allegations about what GECAS was--was doing, for example, it certainly makes you wonder. But, clearly, the US government just simply didn't see it that way, and I think that that's a fascinating disjunction and really has some pretty big implications for companies thinking about mergers going forward, for what's going to happen between the Europe--between Europe and the US concerning negotiations over competition policy as well.
INSANA: Does it threaten trade relations between the two--between the US and Europe?

Prof. WATKINS: It complicates an already complicated situation. We've got, you know, the holdover of beef hormones. We've got the foreign sales corporation issues. There's a whole lot of trans-Atlantic issues that are

Page 110 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
brewing. And for those of th--of us that have been watching this, we see it as, in fact, a kind of trade issue, and
it--and it may--it may end up being part of the--the central work that needs to be done between the two--the two
parties in an upcoming round of trade negotiation.
INSANA: All right. Professor Watkins, thanks for joining us. Appreciate it. Prof. WATKINS: Glad to be here.
INSANA: Michael Watkins of the Harvard Business School.

SUE HERERA (Co-anchor): Well, the second half of the year is just under way, and our Trading Stocks panel is going to take a look at what's ahead for the second half of this year.

INSANA: And then, investors do it all the time: buy stocks they hear analysts recommending on TV. But are those recommendations biased? New rules may have analysts disclosing ownership in companies they cover on TV. We'll have the details.

CORRECTED COPY, EU Rejects Proposed  GE-Honeywell Merger

JACK CAFFERTY, CNNfn ANCHOR, BEFORE HOURS: The  European Union rejected GE`s (URL: http://www.ge.com/) $41 billion bid to take over Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) . The decision was widely expected. It marks the first time a proposed merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by European regulators. The EuropeanCommission is announcing its decision. I just - we just did this. Oh, we`re going live to Strasbourg now. These pictures - apparently this is the official announcement of the decision. Let`s listen.
(JOINED IN PROGRESS)

MARIO MONTI, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: ... severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines. However, there were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed.

I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission`s competition concerns. The European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice have worked in close cooperation during this investigation, as we always do with the Justice Department, or the Federal Trade Commission on cases which involve both jurisdiction. It is unfortunate that in the end, in this case, we reached different conclusions. But each authority has to perform its own assessment and the risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never be totally excluded. This does not mean that one authority is doing a technical analysis and the other is pursuing a political goal, but simply that we might interpret facts differently and forecasts the effects of a operation in different ways. The GE-Honeywell is a rare case, where the trans-Atlantic competition authorities have disagreed. I am determined to strengthen our bilateral cooperation in the future to try and reduce this risk further.
What were, in a ,nutshell our competition concerns? Well, you see the combination of the two companies`
activities, would have resulted in the creation of dominant positions in the markets for the supply of avionics,
non-avionics and corporate jet engines; as well as in the strengthening of GE`s existing dominant positions in jet
engines for large commercial and large regional jets. The dominance would have been created or strengthened
as a result of horizontal overlaps in some markets as well as through the extension of the GE`s financial power
and vertical integration to Honeywell activities, and of the combination of their respective complementary
products. Such integration would enable the merged entity to leverage the respective market power of the two
companies into the products of one another. This would have left the - this would have had the effect of
foreclosing competitors, thereby eliminating competition in these markets, ultimately affecting adversely product
quality, service and consumer prices. The fourteenth of June was the deadline under our rules for the submission
of undertakings. On the fourteenth of June, GE proposed a number of undertakings intended to address these
concerns, which were considered insufficient to remove the competition problems identified by the Commission.
On 28, June, well beyond the deadline for the submission of undertakings, GE proposed a new set of remedies.
This new package could not be accepted either, because it did not resolve the problems identified in a sufficiently
clear way at such a very late stage in the procedure.
Before leaving the floor to your questions.

CAFFERTY: That was Mario Monti, live from Europe, explaining all the reasons he and his colleagues made a terrible decision in turning down the GE-Honeywell merger..

COMMISSION SET TO VOTE ON GE HONEYWELL

The European Union's 20-member executive  Commission plans to vote Tuesday on General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last minute proposals or withdrawal of the merger, EU officials said Monday.
The EU is widely expected to  reject the deal at its meeting in Strasbourg, France. Comair back in air
Comair returned to the skies Monday after a crippling three-month pilots strike and now must work to win back travelers and rebuild its fleet.

Before the strike began March 26, Comair was the nation's second-largest regional airline. But it faces new competition at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and a slowing economy.

Both sides also acknowledged possible resentment between pilots and workers who were laid off because of the strike, the first since the airline was founded in 1977.
New board members

A preliminary vote count shows three candidates representing Weyerhaeuser Co. won seats on the board of directors of timber rival Willamette Industries, both companies said Monday.
The results represent an important step in Weyerhaeuser's hostile $5.5 billion takeover attempt of the
Portland-based company --- but the effort is far from over.
Steven Rogel, Weyerhaeuser's chairman, president and chief executive, interpreted the result as a signal that
Willamette shareholders want company officials to reach an agreement for a negotiated takeover.
Bakery takeover

Consumer goods giant Sara Lee Corp. will buy Earthgrains Co., a commercial baked goods maker, for $1.6 billion in cash, the companies announced Monday.

Chicago-based Sara Lee said it will pay $40.25 for each Earthgrains share. Earthgrains has about 41.1 million shares outstanding, according to its most recent earnings statement.
Ford hiring
Ford Motor Co. has hired the former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as a consultant. Sue Bailey was hired a few weeks ago as an internal consultant, Ford spokesman Jason Vines said Monday. Vines emphasized that Bailey has ''nothing to do with the Explorer. She's here to help out with the tire
replacement program and with this public health issue.''

European Commisssion to Officially Reject GE-Honeywell Merger Proposal

SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn ANCHOR, AHEAD OF THE CURVE: For the latest on the  GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/) -Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) deal, let`s check in with CNN`s Diana Muriel. She joins us live now from Strasbourg, France, where the EuropeanCommission is meeting to vote on the deal.
Hello -- Diana.
DIANA MURIEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Susan.

Yes, the 20-strong European Commission, which is the European Union`s executive arm, will be starting their meeting in approximately 40 minutes time here in Strasbourg. Unless they receive a full withdrawal of the merger from both GE and Honeywell, they will continue with their agenda.
They will vote on the merger as it currently stands, and as it currently stands, they are likely to move to veto it. They will then make their announcement at a press conference at 3:00 in the afternoon Central European time,
9:00 in the morning Eastern Standard Time, where Mario Monti, who`s the European competition commissioner,
will make the announcement as to what the outcome of that vote has been.

But it`s very likely, at this stage, that it will be a block to the merger. That`s because both GE and Honeywell have given no notification of a withdrawal. As I say, it will take both companies to move. Honeywell is unlikely to make
a formal application for a withdrawal, because they want to see enshrined, if you like, on GE`s record, that it`s in a dominant position, that it has anti-competitive practices, if you like.

And that could lead the way open for the other companies who compete against GE, perhaps in other fields, to make complaints to the European Commission about their dominant position.
As a result of the failure of this deal -- if that is indeed how the vote goes -- we could also see Honeywell sue GE
for failing to bring the deal to a positive conclusion, for failing to use reasonable best efforts to conclude the deal.

As far as GE is concerned, it`s very likely now that if the deal does not go ahead, as is likely, that Jack Welch, the chief executive officer of GE, will bring forward his retirement. He stayed on. He delayed his retirement in order to see this deal go through. It`s likely that he will then leave the company very soon, in the next few weeks.

And both companies could be looking for alternative deals. It`s possible that United Technologies (URL: http://www.utc.com/) , which was talking with Honeywell about a possible deal last October -- before GE came in with a higher offer -- will resume those negotiations for a possible merger between those two companies. But at what price is a moot point. It`s unlikely to be at the same price that was being discussed in October, given the fall in the Honeywell share price in the meantime -- Susan.
LISOVICZ: Diana Muriel, in Strasbourg, France, thank you.

EU blocks  GE's Honeywell merger Regulators feared market dominance

The European Union blocked General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. today, the first time a proposed merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by  European regulators.

The veto of one of the world's largest industrial mergers by the EU's 20-member executive  Commission was widely expected after the American companies failed to allay European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

The merger would have had big implications for Evendale-based GE Aircraft Engines, which would have absorbed Honeywell's aerospace business and seen its annual revenue double to more than $20 billion.

"It was a big opportunity for GE Aircraft Engines to be the headquarters, but it also would have been a major undertaking," GEAE spokesman Rick Kennedy said. "But (GE) Aircraft Engines' position in the world is better than ever, and we will go on."

Teams of GEAE workers had been planning for the integration of the two businesses for months and were developing a new name for the combined company, which would have been based in Evendale.

As recently as a month ago, GE President and CEO David L. Calhou said GE officials were hopeful Europe would approve the merger.

The European Commission today said that while GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, "the remedies proposed . . . were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

It said the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's "dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets."
The companies' plans now were not immediately clear.

GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again. But many believe the deal is dead.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company would not comment until it gets official word of the decision. Honeywell had no immediate comment on the EU decision.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.
On the New York Stock Exchange today, GE shares slipped 70 cents to $49.50, while Honeywell shares gained
99 cents to $35.10 a share.

The European Commission is expected to reject General Electric's  $42 billion takeover bid for  Honeywell International when it meets later today. Commission experts have argued the  merger would give the two firms an unfair advantage over rivals in the civil aviation industry.
DALTON TANONAKA, CNN ANCHOR: The  European Commission is expected to reject General Electric's
$42 billion takeover bid for  Honeywell  International when it meets later today. Commission experts have argued
the merger would give the two firms an unfair advantage over rivals in the civil aviation industry.

As CNN's Allan Chernoff reports, a rejection would be a major defeat for one of the most respected CEOs in the world.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): General Electric's Jack Welch, the most celebrated chief executive officer of our time. But now the business world is wondering if Welch dropped the ball as he was rushing to score his final basket.
JACK WELCH, CEO, GENERAL ELECTRIC: We feel very optimistic that this is a layup.

CHERNOFF: There's little doubt Welch spoke too soon when he claimed GE's purchase of Honeywell would have no problem passing regulatory review.
WELCH: The businesses have no product overlaps, so there's no government considerations to speak of. CHERNOFF: Antitrust experts say Welch should have checked with his European attorneys before doing the
deal.

LARRY WHITE, NYU STERN: Egos should not be discounted. Jack Welch himself clearly wanted to go out with a major success, and this is leaving him, I think, with a little bit of egg on his face.

CHERNOFF: GE's bid for Honeywell was a rush job, out of necessity. Last October 19th, United Technologies and Honeywell revealed they were discussing "a business combination." Honeywell's board met on Friday the
20th. Jack Welch called Honeywell CEO Michael Bonsignore during the meeting, then faxed him a handwritten offer to buy Honeywell.

Not only did Welch miscalculate how tough European competition commissioner Mario Monti would be in reviewing the deal, but also how determined United Technologies and its CEO would be to block the deal after getting trumped by Welch.

In a "Worth" magazine article on the best CEOs, United Technologies' chief executive George David said, "I hate like hell to lose." The same issue described David as "a classic let's-show-some-discipline-dammit CEO."

United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney division competes with GE in jet engines. Its antitrust lawyers effectively argued to the Europeans that GE's aircraft leasing unit pressures aircraft makers to use GE engines.

STEVEN BUFFONE, GIBSON, DUNN & CRUTCHER: It looks like United Technologies didn't give up. This is a deal that was taken away from them, and with a hard-driving CEO that they looked and explored other options to get the deal back.

CHERNOFF (on camera): Now it appears United Technologies may have the last laugh. The European
Commission has scheduled a press conference for tomorrow, where it is expected to announce its vote.

EU blocks  $41 billion US GE-Honeywell merger over competition fears

STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ The  European Union blocked General Electric  Co.'s $41-billion US purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. on Tuesday, the first time a proposed merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by European regulators.

The veto of one of the world's largest industrial mergers by the EU's 20-member executive  commission was widely expected after the American companies failed to allay European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.

``The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines,'' EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

A statement from the commission added that while GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, ``the remedies proposed ... were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns'' resulting from the merger.

It said the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's ``dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets.''

The commission's decision was unanimous. It came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.

EU officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both companies were notified immediately after the decision.

The companies' plans now were not immediately clear. GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again. But many believe the deal is dead.
A statement from GE said the company was ``deeply disappointed'' with the decision.

``We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices,'' the statement said.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company has not decided whether it will appeal the decision. In the statement, GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch referred to the decision as a ``setback.''

Nicholas Heymann, a General Electric analyst with Prudential Securities, said the response suggested GE may appeal the decision.
``It's a very good chance,'' Heymann said. ``I think that remains a very real possibility.''

Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane said, ``We're disappointed in their decision,'' referring to the European commission's veto.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

However, the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities has raised American hackles.

U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible ``chilling effect'' on trans-Atlantic relations. Even President Bush expressed concern.

EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust co-operation is generally good. As evidence, Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation between the agencies.
Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal _ WorldCom-Sprint
_ was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.

On Friday GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell. Welch said Honeywell's proposal ``makes no sense'' for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.

As a result of the failed deal, Honeywell's board of directors is reportedly going to oust chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore at a meeting Tuesday.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that his replacement will be Lawrence Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.
Honeywell's Crane would not comment Tuesday on the newspaper report.
In late morning trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares fell 93 cents to $49.27 US, while
Honeywell shares gained $1.01 to $35.12 US a share.

Text of EU statement  on GE-Honeywell merger

The text of the  European Commission's statement explaining its veto of the  GE-Honeywell merger:

The European Commission has decided to prohibit the proposed acquisition by  General Electric  Co. of Honeywell  Inc. This follows an in-depth investigation in the markets for aero engines, avionics and other aircraft components and systems. In adopting this decision, the  commission concluded that the merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell.

``The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines. However, there were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed,'' European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said, adding: ``I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the commission's competition concerns.''

Mr. Monti also said, in relation to the co-operation with the U.S. antitrust authorities: ``The European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice have worked in close co-operation during this investigation. It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions, but each authority has to perform its own assessment and the risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never be totally excluded. This does not mean that one authority is doing a technical analysis and the other pursuing a political goal, as some might pretend, but simply that we might interpret facts differently and forecast the effects of an operation in different ways. GE-Honeywell is a rare case where the transatlantic competition authorities have disagreed. I am determined to strengthen our bilateral co-operation in the future to try and reduce this risk further.''

GE and Honeywell notified their merger agreement for regulatory clearance in Europe on 5 February this year. On March 1, the commission started an in-depth investigation which demonstrated that GE alone already had a dominant position in the markets for jet engines for large commercial and large regional aircraft. Its strong market position combined with its financial strength and vertical integration into aircraft leasing were among the factors that led to the finding of GE's dominance in these markets. The investigation also showed that Honeywell is the leading supplier of avionics and non-avionics products, as well as of engines for corporate jets and of engine starters (i.e., a key input in the manufacturing of engines).

The combination of the two companies' activities would have resulted in the creation of dominant positions in the markets for the supply of avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines, as well as the strengthening of GE's existing dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets. The dominance would have been created or strengthened as a result of horizontal overlaps in some markets as well as through the extension of GE's financial power and vertical integration to Honeywell activities and of the combination of their respective complementary products. Such integration would enable the merged entity to leverage the respective market power of the two companies into the products of one another. This would have the effect of foreclosing competitors, thereby eliminating competition in these markets, ultimately affecting adversely product quality, service and consumers' prices.

On 14 June, GE proposed a number of undertakings intended to address these concerns which were considered insufficient to remove the competition problems identified by the commission. On 28 June, well beyond the deadline for the submission of undertakings, GE proposed a new set of remedies. This new package could not be accepted either, because it did not resolve the problems identified in a sufficiently clear way at such a very late stage in the procedure.

Given the nature of the competition concerns resulting from the proposed merger and the fact that the GE was unable to propose undertakings that would have removed all competition concerns, the commission had no choice but prohibit the merger.

European Commission Blocks  GE's Proposed  $41 Billion Acquisition of Honeywell
1,199 words
3 July 2001

Dow Jones Business News
DJON

(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
STRASBOURG, France -- The  European Commission has blocked General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion  merger
with Honeywell  International Inc.

"The Commission concluded that the merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the  competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of  Honeywell,"  it said in a statement Tuesday.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell as it was notified would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in the statement.

"There were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed," Mr. Monti said. "I regret that the companies weren't able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns."
The rejection by European Union antitrust officials, which marked the first time a proposed merger between two
U.S. companies has been prevented solely by European regulators, had been expected.

The commission's decision was unanimous. It came after a one-hour meeting during which Mr. Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.

GE (GE) now can either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again. But many industry watchers expect GE, Fairfield, Conn., to walk away from the deal.

GE said Tuesday in a prepared statement that it was "deeply disappointed" by the commission's decision and "strongly disagreed with the commission's conclusions about the competitive effects" of the deal. The company also noted the commission took "a fundamentally different approach to competitive issues" than regulators in the U.S., Canada and other jurisdictions.

"I feel profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen," GE Chairman and Chief Executive John "Jack" F. Welch Jr. said in the company's statement.

Last week Honeywell (HON), Morristown, N.J., made a last-ditch proposal to salvage its takeover by GE, saying it would accept a lower purchase price to compensate GE for lost income from divestitures required by the EC.

But Mr. Welch spurned the proposal, saying it didn't offer any strategic benefit to GE shareholders and wouldn't satisfy European antitrust concerns.

Honeywell's last-minute appeal came a day after Mr. Monti, who was overseeing the investigation into the merger, turned down an earlier 11th-hour proposal from the two companies to assuage the EU's concerns. The proposed concessions included the sale of a 19.9% stake in GE's lucrative GE Capital Aviation Services aircraft-leasing and financing business.

The commission said Gecas, a large purchaser of aircraft, unfairly exerts pressure on manufacturers to buy GE products and insisted that GE sell at least a 20% stake in the unit in the open market, maybe even to competitors, to make the unit at least semi-independent.



Page 126 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But GE balked at that demand. Gecas is a valuable contributor of income to GE, partly through the depreciation of its airplanes. Under U.S. tax laws, such depreciation wouldn't be allowed if GE sold a stake of 20% or more in the unit to another party.

Mr. Monti explained his reasons for rejecting the proposed compromise in a telephone call to Mr. Welch last Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Monti stressed that any changes to the offer would have to be clearly effective, since regulators wouldn't have time to adequately test-market the proposal, these people said.

Speaking at a press conference Tuesday in Strasbourg, Mr. Monti said the commission had "never asked" GE to cede control of Gecas. "However, we did require a structural committment so that there could be no discrimination as far as purchases were concerned," he added.

In announcing the Honeywell acquisition last October, Mr. Welch heralded it as a milestone deal in GE's history. Certainly, it was the largest and viewed as the crowning glory of Mr. Welch's storied career as the main architect of GE's remarkable operating performance.

The deal won conditional antitrust clearance in Washington in May, but its tortured path in Europe raised concern among Bush administration officials. Some in Congress have even accused the EU of protectionism and threatened retaliation.

EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust cooperation is generally good. As evidence, Mr. Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation between the agencies.

Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal -- WorldCom-Sprint -- was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.

"It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions, but each authority has to perform its own assessment," Mr. Monti said Tuesday in reference to the U.S. Department of Justice, which had cleared the deal. "This doesn't mean that one authority is doing a technical analysis and the other pursuing a political goal ... but simply that we might interpret facts differently and forecast the effects of an operation in different ways," he said.
"GE/Honeywell is a rare case where the transatlantic competition authorities have disagreed," Mr. Monti said. "I
am determined to strengthen our bilateral cooperation in the future to try and reduce this risk further."
He noted that U.S. authorities have blocked mergers of EU companies because of competition concerns.

Mr. Monti declined to respond to criticisms by U.S. officials of the Commission's handling of the case. But he said that such public comments from politicians underline the need to distance regulation of mergers from political power.
Justice Department Antitrust Chief Questions Decision
Europe's decision to block the merger "reflects a significant point of divergence" with the U.S., Assistant Attorney
General for Antitrust Charles James said in a statement.

"For years, the U.S. and European Union competition authorities have enjoyed close and cooperative relations," James said. "In fact, there were extensive consultations in this matter throughout the entire process."

But EU's decision "points to the continuing need for consultation to move toward greater policy convergence," James said.
The Justice Department had reached a "firm conclusion" that the merger, as conditioned, "would have been
pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers," Mr. James said. "Our conclusion was based on findings, confirmed
by customers world-wide, that the combined firm could offer better products and services at more attractive prices
than either firm could offer individually."

But the EU "apparently concluded that a more diversified, and thus more competitive, GE could somehow disadvantage other market participants," Mr. James said. "Consequently, we appear to have reached different results from similar assessments of competitive conditions in the affected markets.
U.S. antitrust policy holds that antitrust laws "protect competition, not competitors," Mr. James said. "Today's EU
decision reflects a significant point of divergence."

EU nixes merger of 2 U.S. concerns

STRASBOURG, France -- The  European Union blocked General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. on Tuesday, the first time a proposed merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by European regulators.

The veto of one of the world's largest industrial mergers by the EU's 20-member executive  Commission was widely expected after the American companies failed to allay European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

A statement from the Commission added that while GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, "the remedies proposed . . . were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

It said the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's "dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets."

The Commission's decision was unanimous. It came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.

EU officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both companies were notified immediately after the decision.

The companies' plans now were not immediately clear. GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again. But many believe the deal is dead.
A statement from GE said the company was "deeply disappointed" with the decision.

"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," the statement said.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company has not decided whether it will appeal the decision. In the statement, GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch referred to the decision as a "setback."

Nicholas Heymann, a General Electric analyst with Prudential Securities, said the response suggested GE may appeal the decision.
Honeywell had no immediate comment on the EU decision.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

However, the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities has raised American hackles.

U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible "chilling effect" on trans-Atlantic relations. Even President Bush expressed concern.

EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust cooperation is generally good. As evidence, Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation between the agencies.

Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal -- WorldCom-Sprint -- was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.

On Friday GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell. Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders. Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.

As a result of the failed deal, Honeywell's board of directors is reportedly going to oust chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore at a meeting Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that his replacement will be Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp.
Tom Crane, a spokesman for Honeywell, would not comment Tuesday on the newspaper report. Document dn00000020010711dx7300mg4

The European Union's 20-member executive  Commission plans to vote today on  General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last-minute proposals or withdrawal of the  merger, EU officials said Monday.
The EU is widely expected to  reject the deal at its meeting in Strasbourg, France.

"There are no plans for withdrawal," GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said Monday.
In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares were up $1.20 to close at $50.20, while
Honeywell shares were down 79 cents and closed at $34.11.

AVIONICS - COMMISSION BLOWS GE-HONEYWELL DEAL OUT OF THE SKY.
870 words
4 July 2001
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2001 European Report.
General Electric's  planned acquisition of avionics company  Honeywell  was blocked by the European                 Commission at its weekly meeting in Strasbourg on July 3. The $42 billion (Euro 47 billion) deal which was first announced in October last year and was cleared by US competition authorities in May met with opposition from Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, and his Merger Task Force. They were concerned that it would lead
to GE gaining a very strong position in the market for aircraft engines and electronics. GE's competitors had also made antitrust complaints about the strength of the company's leasing arm GECAS (General Electric  Capital Aviation Services).

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines. However, there were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed", said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. "I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns."
Parting of the ways?

The Commissioner also stressed that the GE-Honeywell decision was a rare parting of the ways for competition authorities on either side of the Atlantic and he hoped that the good relations between them would be maintained.

"The European Commission and the US Department of Justice have worked in close co-operation during this investigation", said Mr Monti. "It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions, but each authority has to perform its own assessment and the risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never be totally excluded. This does not mean that one authority is doing a technical analysis and the other pursuing a political goal, as some might pretend, but simply that we might interpret facts differently and forecast the effects of an operation in different ways. The GE-Honeywell is a rare case where the transatlantic competition authorities have disagreed. I am determined to strengthen our bilateral co-operation in the future to try and reduce this risk further."Mr Monti further added that it is of no importance in a competition case investigated by the Commission where companies are based geographically. "The nationality is irrelevant", said Mr Monti. "The complaints about the merger came both from the EU and the US and they came from both competitors and clients of GE." The Commissioner claimed that companies such as United Technologies, Rolls-Royce and Rockwell and various European airlines had made complaints about the GE-Honeywell merger.

Mr Monti also denied suggestions that the Commission had late in the day changed its approach and its analysis of the deal thus making it nearly impossible for GE and Honeywell to come up with a solution. "It is simply wrong to say the Commission moved from bundling to an analysis of the vertical effects of the deal late in the investigation. The vertical effect was spotted right at the beginning of the case", said Mr Monti. "It was two weeks after the June 14 deadline, when GE had said that that was its final offer, that we received another offer. The assessment of June 28 was one of prima facie, and that at that late stage in the examination we had to ask whether there was anything sufficient to stop us from taking a negative view. At such a late stage there has to be more than just a feeling that the competition concerns are removed."Political pressure.The case has become a political issue in the US with separate letters of complaint being sent by Senator John D Rockefeller, Chairman of the US Senate Aviation Subcommittee and Senator Earnest Hollings, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, to Mr Monti, Commission Vice-President Loyola de Palacio (see European Report 2605) and Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy. US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill also commented in the same week that the Commission's decision was "off the wall" and that the EU institution was behaving in an autocratic manner.In a written reply to Senator Rockefeller, the Commission robustly defended it merger decisions and also claiming that the anti-trust bodies in Brussels and Washington had a good working relationship and one that they wanted to maintain. In a speech to a competition conference organised by the EU Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce on June 26 Mr Monti said "There is a desire to maintain the
Page 137 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
close contacts with the US's anti-trust decision-makers. I intend to continue the dialogue I have had over the past two years."The Commissioner made it clear on July 3 that the Commission despite its desire to work closely with the US authorities it does not look lightly on the use of political pressure in an attempt to change its position on merger cases. "No other competition authority in the world has competency for state aid as well as a competition and mergers responsibility", said Mr Monti. "We have been involved in conflicts with Member States on state aid and we remain distinctly unimpressed by political pressure from within and outside of the EU."

EU VETOES AMBITIOUS GE DEAL APPEAL IS CONSIDERED; HONEYWELL CEO QUITS

Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. on Tuesday, though
GE chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the  rejection a "setback."
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

Hours after the EU's veto, Honeywell took steps to move forward, however, announcing that chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore had resigned. He will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission. The ruling was widely expected after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
"We will consider all of our options," Sheffer said.

An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the Commission since 1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far have been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the Commission, one was withdrawn, and two are still pending.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the Commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.
A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination said a
GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal, but to limit the decision's impact on the company's ability to
do business in Europe.

"Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedental value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe," said the lawyer, John Briggs, of Howrey, Simon, Arnold & White LLP in Washington, D.C.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, still plans on retiring by the end of this year, though the exact timing was unclear.

The unanimous decision came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.
In its statement, GE said the company was "deeply disappointed" with the outcome.

"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," the statement said.

U.S. law to do business in America.

EU switches off GE's Honeywell  takeover.

THE European Commission yesterday blocked the proposed  General Electric  (GE) $42bn (#29.7bn) acquisition of Honeywell  International, killing what had been billed as the world's largest industrial  merger despite its approval  in the United States.

The 20-member EU executive, meeting in Strasbourg, took the bold step over concerns the deal would have forced rivals in several aerospace and related markets out of business.

It is only the 15th time in over a decade the commission has blocked a merger and the first time it has barred an all-American deal, which had been approved by US regulators in May.

The merger negotiations turned into a titanic struggle, with GE unwilling to agree to the far-reaching concessions the commission said were needed for it to approve the deal.

The deal created a transatlantic rift, with US officials from President George W Bush down voicing concern at the commission's handling of the merger.
Paul O'Neill, US treasury secretary, had said EU rejection would be "off the wall".
Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, begged to differ. "The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry
and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," he said.

He added the commission and the US Department of Justice had worked closely during the investigation, and said it was "unfortunate that
in the end we reached different conclusions".
Monti said he was determined to strengthen EU-US
co-operation in the com-petition field in future to try to reduce the risk of transatlantic disputes.
The decision leaves Honeywell facing an uncertain future and a battered share price. - Reuters.

Monti blocks  $42bn merger - Honeywell  hires lawyer as GE deal dies.

Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, ended months of speculation yesterday to block the biggest ever industrial takeover.

He said a $42bn ( #31bn) tie-up between  General Electric  and Honeywell  would have created an unhealthily dominant aerospace giant.

Fallout from the decision was rapid with Honeywell's chairman and chief executive, Michael Bonsignore, expected to stand down last night.

Honeywell has hired David Boies, the lawyer who defeated Microsoft last year, to explore legal remedies. One of these would be to sue GE for failing to make its "best effort" to complete the merger agreement signed last October.

Shrugging off US suggestions that his decision was politically motivated, Mr Monti said the companies made too few concessions, too late.
The merged entity could have competed unfairly in the multi-billion dollar market for jet engines and avionics.

"The merger would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," he said in a statement.

It is the first time the European Commission has killed off a merger between two US companies which the Americans have already approved, a development several US sena tors warned could damage transatlantic relations.

Mr Monti rejected accusations of anti-US bias. "The nationality of the company is totally irrelevant for the competition assessment," he told a press conference.

Jack Welch, the GE chairman who postponed his retirement to finish the merger, said: "I feel profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

As the Honeywell board met in New York to discuss its response, a spokesman said it was "obviously disappointed" with the rejection.
Shares in Honeywell rose more than $1 to $35.46 amid speculation that another buyer would step in. Shares in
GE fell slightly.

Honeywell  chief leaves after GE deal fails The European veto of the planet-size  industrial merger is a first
for U.S. companies.

NEW YORK --  General Electric's  $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International was vetoed Tuesday by the European Union -- the first time a  merger of two U.S. companies has been stopped solely by  European              regulators.
The decision by the  EU's 20-member Competition Commission in Strasbourg, France, was unanimous.

The merger "would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.
Michael R. Bonsignore resigned as Honeywell's chairman and chief executive after the commission's rejection.
He will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which
in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the name.

GE chief executive Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, characterizing the widely expected rejection as a setback. But analysts said the deal -- one of the biggest industrial mergers in history -- is probably dead.
The deal won approval from U.S. antitrust regulators but ran into resistance from the EU, angering some
Congress members.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law, just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

The commission vetoed the deal after executives failed to allay European fears that their merged company would dominate markets for jet engines and aircraft electronics.

Of the 15 mergers rejected by the commission since 1990, six have been taken to court. No challenge has been successful.
The combined company would have been a behemoth.

Honeywell, with about 120,000 employees worldwide, makes industrial plastics and chemicals as well as equipment for aerospace systems, power generation, transportation and factories.

GE is best known for making light bulbs and appliances, but it also includes NBC and makes power plant parts and aircraft engines. It has 313,000 employees.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators. But GE rejected the revisions Friday.

The Wall Street Journal had reported that Honeywell's board of directors would oust Bonsignore as a result of the failed deal.
GE fell 69 cents to $49.51 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Honeywell rose 99 cents to $35.10. Document grpr000020010711dx7400mio

Monti pledges stronger US ties after GE veto.

THE EUROPEAN Competition Comissioner, Mario Monti, pledged yesterday to strengthen co-operation with anti-trust authorities in the US after formally vetoing General Electric's  $42bn (#29.9bn) takeover of  Honeywell.

Mr Monti said it was "unfortunate" that Brussels had decided to block the deal, the world's biggest industrial merger, when it had already been cleared by the US Justice Department. But he added: "GE-Honeywell  is a rare case where the transatlantic  competition authorities have disagreed. I am determined to strengthen our bilateral co-operation in the future to try and reduce this risk further."

The refusal of the companies to withdraw the merger, which led to a formal prohibition by Brussels, means that GE will now be on record as having a "dominant position" in the aeroengine market, which could compromise it in future deals.

Expectations are also growing that Honeywell's chief executive Robert Bonsignore could lose his job over the deal.

Mr Monti said the merger would have enabled GE and Honeywell to leverage their market power in engines and avionics: "The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers."
Outlook, above.

JACK WELCH of General Electric  was treated to the Full  Monti yesterday and it was not a pretty sight. The failure of GE and Honeywell  to withdraw their $42bn aerospace  merger left the  European Competition              Commissioner with no option but to prohibit it formally, which probably suited no-one.

GE now goes on the record as being a "dominant" player in the airline market, and where regulators see dominance they sooner or later start rooting around for evidence of abuse. As for Mr Monti, he will now have to set out his arguments for blocking the deal in detail, which will give  GE's lawyers an excuse for picking through the text in search of ammunition for an appeal to the  European Court of Justice.
Nor are the prospects for transatlantic harmony among regulators enhanced by Brussels' decision to block
GE-Honeywell when it had already been given the green light by the US Justice Department.

Magnanimous in his victory, if that is the correct word, Mr Monti has pledged to strengthen co-operation with US anti-trust authorities to reduce the risk of another mess like this in future. But in doing so, Mr Monti must not surrender the principles which led Europe to block GE and Honeywell from merging after the Americans had arrogantly assumed approval was a foregone conclusion.

Whatever GE may say, this merger was essentially about strengthening GE's dominance in a way which would have allowed it to undermine the competition. In the short term, airline customers might have benefited from lower prices and better deals. But in the long-run, as the Commission rightly concluded, they and their customers would have paid a high price for a weakened competition.

GE chief under fire as EU blocks  EUR53bn merger entirely.

"I could've gone home early and been a great hero," said Mr Jack Welch when he announced in October that he was postponing his retirement to oversee a $45 billion (EUR53 billion)  merger between the giant US corporation General Electric  and industrial conglomerate  Honeywell  International. "I'm the one that's putting my neck on the line," he said.

Yesterday the  EU Commission announced it was blocking what would have been one of the world's biggest mergers, and the chief executive of  GE, a revered titan of corporate America, now goes into retirement with his reputation badly dented. Mr Welch's critics in the US say he failed to anticipate the extent of  European objections to "the cleanest deal you've ever seen" on the grounds that it would create an unfairly dominant position for
jetliner engines and aircraft electronics in world markets.

EU Competition Commissioner Mr Mario Monti said in Strasbourg yesterday that the merger "would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines". The Commission added that the deal would give the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics. GE reacted angrily to the decision. It "strongly disagreed" with the Commission's findings about the competitive effects of the merger and said "the facts just don't support these assertions". The company claimed that "this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of
quality, service and prices". It said that the Commission "took a fundamentally different approach to competitive issues than its counterparts in the US, Canada and nearly a dozen other jurisdictions, which approved the acquisition with few, if any conditions".

The fall-out from yesterday's decision has devastated Honeywell's management. Its board of directors met yesterday to oust chairman and chief executive Mr Michael Bonsignore and replace him with Mr Lawrence Bossidy (66). The blocking of the GEHoneywell merger is seen in the US as a result of a fundamental difference in regulatory principles between Europe and the US. The EU is perceived as primarily concerned with the effect on business competition, while the US looks first to consumers' interests.

The point was underlined tartly by Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan recently: "The advance of consumer interests is fundamentally the underlying rule of all American antitrust statutes. That's not true in Europe." United Technologies, which complained to the EU Commission about the GE-Honeywell deal, is expected to renew its bid for Honeywell, presenting EU and US regulators with a possible new case to adjudicate.

Out of 400 big mergers adjudicated by both the EU and the US since 1990, the GEHoneywell deal is the first to be slapped down in Europe after gaining US approval. Honeywell may now sue GE for breach of contract. Its market value and earnings have slipped as it waited for the expected take-over.

Mr Welch will step down soon as head of GE, unless his company appeals the EU decision. He has received $7 million for rights to his biography to be published this year.

EU scuppers Pounds 30bn US merger

AMERICAN industrialist Jack Welch's dream Pounds 30bn megamerger between his  General Electric  and
Honeywell  was blown out of the sky by the  European Union.

Despite winning the blessing of US authorities, the world's biggest industrial deal was blocked by  EU                    Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, dubbed 'Super Mario'.

It would have combined GE's aero engines with Honeywell's aircraft electronics systems, but Monti argued they would have had unfair control over key areas of the European aerospace industry.

Among those who raised objections were engine-maker Rolls-Royce and airlines on both sides of the Atlantic. European plane-builder Airbus, part-owned by BAE Systems, was a supporter.

It is the first time the EU has rejected an all-American merger, sparking an angry reaction and threats of retaliation from congressmen on Capitol Hill.

GE chairman Jack Welch last week rejected a compromise by Honeywell's Michael Bonsignore who wanted to sell part of GE Capital Aviation Services to secure EU approval.

Welch, who staked his reputation on the deal and put off his retirement until it was completed, is expected to step down within weeks. Bonsignore now looks likely to come under pressure.

There is speculation that Honeywell could renew talks with America's United Technologies, owner of engine-maker Pratt & Whitney.

EU watchdog appeals for global  antitrust efforts

GENEVA (AP) - The  European regulator who scuttled the merger of U.S. giants  General Electric  and Honeywell  appealed Wednesday for world cooperation among antitrust watchdogs to ease fears of global domination by big business.

"Competition policy, and specifically international cooperation on  competition policy, has an important role to play if we are to avoid resentment against globalization and protectionist backlash," said EUCompetition Commissioner Mario Monti.

The European Union's decision to block General Electric's purchase of Honeywell after it had been approved by American regulators has prompted some key members of the U.S. Congress to suggest the United States might start looking to block plans among European companies to merge.

Monti has already described the EU decision as "a rare case" of trans-Atlantic antitrust disagreement and urged close cooperation between EU and U.S. regulators to prevent future clashes over mergers.

In a speech to a United Nations meeting Wednesday, Monti said that cooperation needs to be broadened beyond the two governments most directly involved in overseeing mergers because "bilateral agreements are clearly not enough."

"Involving more competition authorities in the discussion of international competition cases will yield better results both for bilateral as well as for multilateral cooperation," he said.

Monti appealed to developing countries at the meeting of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development to drop their objections to including the issue in a new round of World Trade Organization negotiations.
The issue is one of the biggest obstacles to starting a new round of global round of trade negotiations at a WTO
ministerial meeting set for Nov. 9-13 in Doha, Qatar.

"Launching negotiations on a realistic competition agreement at Doha is essential to establish a solid basis for international cooperation against anticompetitive practices with an impact on international trade," said Monti.

The developing countries say it is impossible for them to make commitments on competition policy when many don't even have national laws on the subject.

About 80 countries worldwide currently have antitrust legislation and other systems designed to prevent dominance by one or a small group of companies in a particular trading sector. Only about 30 developing countries have such policies.

Monti said the EU wants to see an agreement which would set out the "core principles" of competition policy, such as transparency, nondiscrimination and due process, but said it would not cover the technical issues involved in an antitrust investigation at this stage.

At the same time, the EU wants to set up a Global Competition Forum, where competition authorities would meet to discuss issues of common importance.
"The range of international antitrust issues of common concern is very wide," Monti told reporters.

Rubens Ricupero, secretary-general of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, stressed that ensuring fair competition is vital to boost developing nations' economies.

"Competition is the soul of the market," Ricupero said. "I take issue with the widespread perception that competition should be a luxury, something which a developing country only needs when it reaches a high degree of development."

Honeywell  CEO Bonsignore resigns  after merger with GE rejected

NEW YORK (AP) - Michael R. Bonsignore resigned as chairman and chief executive of  Honeywell  International Inc. Tuesday following the EuropeanCommission's rejection of the company's planned dlrs 41 billion  merger with General Electric  Co.
Bonsignore, 60, will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal
Corp., which in 1999 acquired  Honeywell  and adopted the  Honeywell  name.

Bossidy, 66, said Honeywell's board wants him to focus on turning the company as a standalone operation, instead of breaking it up, as some analysts had speculated.

The merger agreement with GE is still in effect, but Bossidy said "the Honeywell board is looking at all its options."

"The idea is to stay independent, to get this company back on its feet," Bossidy said, adding that the merger process has been a major distraction for Honeywell and its 120,000 workers.

Some Honeywell assets will probably be sold and jobs cuts are likely, but Bossidy said a more pressing task is to convince employees thinking about leaving the company that they should stay on.
"One of the priorities is to retain people who were otherwise going to leave," he said.

Bossidy faces hefty challenges, however, as Honeywell copes with a new future without General Electric amid a struggling U.S. economy.

Honeywell, which saw first quarter profits fall 92 percent, also said Tuesday that second quarter ongoing earnings will only be 53 to 55 cents per share, below the consensus estimate of 60 cents a share from analysts surveyed
by Thomson Financial/First Call.
With the apparent demise of the GE-Honeywell deal, analysts are looking at Hartford, Connecticut-based United
Technologies, the huge manufacturer of helicopters, as a likely Honeywell suitor.

Bossidy didn't rule out the possibility of Honeywell entering into another combination at some point, but said his task is to rebuild the company. He plans to stay on the job about a year.

"I have some heart and soul in this company. I hate to see it frankly in the condition it is in right now. ... I'm not here for a new career, but for a time I can restore stability," Bossidy said.
United Technologies, which makes jet engines and elevators and helped convince the EU to block the
GE-Honeywell merger, had been in talks to merge with Honeywell when GE suddenly came courting and blocked
that deal last fall.
A GE appeal of the European ruling could block any attempt by Honeywell to find another merger partner. GE
hasn't ruled out an appeal.

Nicholas Heymann, an industry analyst with Prudential Securities in New York, said Bossidy would be more likely to sell individual units of the company, breaking it into as many as a dozen pieces. A GE appeal would not
prevent Bossidy from doing that.

Page 150 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"You could end up getting more value from the parts, by a good margin, than you could for the whole mass," Heymann said.
Bossidy, however, said any divestitures Honeywell makes would not cut into its core aerospace business. Honeywell is known for its technology and creativity, but Heymann said that Bonsignore had failed to execute the
financial restructuring required after AlliedSignal acquired Honeywell for dlrs 14 billion in December 1999.

The combined company, which kept Honeywell's better-known name, makes equipment for aerospace systems, power generation, transportation and automated controls for homes, factories and other buildings, as well as specialty chemicals, plastics, fibers and other industrial materials.

Bossidy said he was first contacted about taking the top Honeywell job about three weeks ago. He declined comment when asked whether Bonsignore was pressured to resign by Honeywell's board.
"I wasn't involved in those discussions," Bossidy said.

Bossidy was previously chairman of AlliedSignal and Honeywell after they merged, retiring in April 2000 and handing the reins to Bonsignore, who had been the Minneapolis-based Honeywell's chief executive.

Bonsignore then started an aggressive cost-cutting program and bolstered Honeywell's Internet business strategy.

But after a strong initial quarter, the new Honeywell International announced in June 2000 that second-quarter profits would fall below expectations. Bonsignore blamed surging raw material prices, a weakened euro and pockets of slow economic activity.

By this April, as the economic slowdown took hold, sales in key markets continued to slump. The company again cited higher costs, but also blamed decisions to halt some business activities and delay plans to sell its consumer automotive products and friction materials businesses because of its pending merger with General Electric.
Since spring, Honeywell has eliminated nearly 6,500 jobs, or about 5 percent of its work force.

Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's on Tuesday affirmed its "stable" ratings outlook for Honeywell, saying the company has "substantial operating diversity, solid competitive positions, a strong financial profile, and a moderate financial policy."
Honeywell shares closed up 99 cents at dlrs 35.10 on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday.

EU blocks  dlrs 41 billion GE-Honeywell merger, citing  competition concerns

NEW YORK (AP) -  Europe has vetoed General Electric  Co.'s dlrs 41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International
Inc., though  GE Chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the rejection a "setback."

The decision Tuesday marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission, a widely expected move after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
"We will consider all of our options," Sheffer said.

Hours after the EU's veto, Honeywell took steps to move forward, however, announcing that chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore had resigned and saying it expected to remain an independent company.
Bonsignore will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal
Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.

An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the Commission since 1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far have been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the Commission, one was withdrawn, and two are still pending.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the Commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

Welch's choice of words left analysts predicting GE was still trying to find a way to get approval for the combination. But they said the odds were against a successful appeal.
"I think they're very slim," said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group.
A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination said a
GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal, but to limit the decision's impact on the company's ability to
do business in Europe.

"Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedental value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe," said the lawyer, John Briggs, of Howrey, Simon, Arnold & White LLP in Washington, D.C.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, still plans on retiring by the end of this year, though the exact timing was unclear.


Page 152 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Late Tuesday, Honeywell's Bossidy said the merger agreement with GE is still in effect, but that "the Honeywell board is looking at all its options."

He made it clear that his mandate is to turn Honeywell around as a standalone company, saying one of his main tasks would be to "try to encourage people to forget the past and forget what might have been and refocus on tomorrow."

A statement from the Commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but "the remedies proposed ... were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

The Commission concluded the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's "dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets."

The unanimous decision came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.
In its statement, GE said the company was "deeply disappointed" with the outcome.

"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," the statement said.

Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane said, "We're disappointed in their decision," referring to the European commission's veto.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.
General Electric Co. is one of the world's largest and most profitable companies. It makes power plant parts,
plane engines, appliances and owns the NBC television network. Honeywell makes aerospace, power generation,
transportation and factory automation systems, as well as specialty chemicals, plastics, fibers and other industrial
materials.

But after a strong initial quarter, the new Honeywell International announced in June 2000 that second-quarter profits would fall below expectations. Bonsignore blamed surging raw material prices, a weakened euro and pockets of slow economic activity.

By this April, as the economic slowdown took hold, sales in key markets continued to slump. Since spring, Honeywell has eliminated nearly 6,500 jobs, or about 5 percent of its work force.
Honeywell shares closed up 99 cents at $35.10 on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday.

EU watchdog appeals for global  antitrust efforts

GENEVA (AP) - The  European regulator who scuttled the merger of U.S. giants  General Electric  and Honeywell  appealed Wednesday for world cooperation among antitrust watchdogs to ease fears of global domination by big business.

"Competition policy, and specifically international cooperation on  competition policy, has an important role to play if we are to avoid resentment against globalization and protectionist backlash," said EUCompetition Commissioner Mario Monti.

The European Union's decision to block General Electric's purchase of Honeywell after it had been approved by American regulators has prompted some key members of the U.S. Congress to suggest the United States might start looking to block plans among European companies to merge.

Monti has already described the EU decision as "a rare case" of trans-Atlantic antitrust disagreement and urged close cooperation between EU and U.S. regulators to prevent future clashes over mergers.

In a speech to a United Nations meeting Wednesday, Monti said that cooperation needs to be broadened beyond the two governments most directly involved in overseeing mergers because "bilateral agreements are clearly not enough."

"Involving more competition authorities in the discussion of international competition cases will yield better results both for bilateral as well as for multilateral cooperation," he said.

Monti appealed to developing countries at the meeting of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development to drop their objections to including the issue in a new round of World Trade Organization negotiations.
The issue is one of the biggest obstacles to starting a new round of global round of trade negotiations at a WTO
ministerial meeting set for Nov. 9-13 in Doha, Qatar.

"Launching negotiations on a realistic competition agreement at Doha is essential to establish a solid basis for international cooperation against anticompetitive practices with an impact on international trade," said Monti.

The developing countries say it is impossible for them to make commitments on competition policy when many don't even have national laws on the subject.

About 80 countries worldwide currently have antitrust legislation and other systems designed to prevent dominance by one or a small group of companies in a particular trading sector. Only about 30 developing countries have such policies.

Monti said the EU wants to see an agreement which would set out the "core principles" of competition policy, such as transparency, nondiscrimination and due process, but said it would not cover the technical issues involved in an antitrust investigation at this stage.

At the same time, the EU wants to set up a Global Competition Forum, where competition authorities would meet to discuss issues of common importance.
"The range of international antitrust issues of common concern is very wide," Monti told reporters.

Rubens Ricupero, secretary-general of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, stressed that ensuring fair competition is vital to boost developing nations' economies.

"Competition is the soul of the market," Ricupero said. "I take issue with the widespread perception that competition should be a luxury, something which a developing country only needs when it reaches a high degree of development."

Management Shakeup At Honeywell

VALERIE MORRIS, CNNfn ANCHOR, TALKING STOCKS: Just hours after the  GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/) Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) merger was blocked yesterday, blocked by the European regulators a management shake up at Honeywell.

FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn ANCHOR, TALKING STOCKS: late yesterday CEO Michael Bonsignore said he was retiring effective immediately. Peter Viles has been following that story for us. Pete joins us with more.
Pete.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

PETER VILES, CNNfn ANCHOR, TALKING STOCKS): Well, Fred and Valerie so many twist and turns in this story it`s really becoming a great boardroom drama> If you own Honeywell stock it`s also very dramatic. What is going to happen with this company? Are they going to get the stock price back up to what is was? Will they ever get an offer as rich as the GE offers that appears now dead? And one of the fascinating stories - aspects of this story is it involves two of the most respected CEOs of the past half century. Of course, Jack Welch at GE and also the man who is coming back to run Honeywell, an old friend of Jack Welch from GE, Larry Bossity (ph).

The GE, Honeywell saga had already delayed one retirement that of Jack Welch. Now it has interrupted another. Larry Bossity, an old Welch friend who turned Honeywell over to Michael Bonsignore 14 months ago is coming back to pick up the pieces in what is turning into an epic boardroom drama.

NICK HEYMAN, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: This is the battle of the Titans on Titanic scale and it took, you know, pulled people in from all levels of all walks of the face of the earth.
VILES: This was two years ago when Bossity thought he was quitting for good.

LARRY BOSSITY: My intention is to retire on April 1st 2000. I`ve told you a number of times that when you leave you leave. When I go home I`ll leave my telephone number, nonetheless I won`t expect the phone to ring.

VILES; the phone rang because Bonsingnore and Welch couldn`t close their deal. In the meantime, Honeywell shares have fallen 44 percent since Bossity and Bonsignore merged Allied Signal and Honeywell. Bossity`s options are to turn the company around or find another buyer. United Technologies (URL:  http://www.utc.com/) wanted the whole thing in October. Will it bid again?

HARRIET BALDWIN, DEUTSCHE BANK ALEX BROWN: We`re pretty positive that United Technologies is going to come in and look at Honeywell very carefully. As they go through the due diligence they`re going to have to decide whether the things that attracted them to Honeywell in the first place are in tact.

VILES: Another option is to avoid the full Monti treatment in Europe by selling Honeywell off piece by piece. The big pieces are aerospace and avionics, engines and flying instruments, automation and building controls, thermostats and valves and performance materials or industrial chemicals.

(on-camera): For the record at a conference call last night Larry Bossity said it is not his intent to break this company up and sell it off. He said quote " the idea is to stay independent and get this company back on its feet. Now when companies are for sell typically CEOs don`t come out and say this company is for sale. Wall Street still believes that portions of this company will be sold off. Perhaps the hold thing in pieces or perhaps the whole thing in one piece to United Technologies. This is not the best time to try to sell a company after a merger has fallen

through in a weakening economy. So, look for a couple of quarters here to get the numbers looking a little better and then perhaps some discussion of what to sell.

That said, small portions of the company were for sale explicitly before the GE and United Technologies deal. these are non core businesses. For instance Honeywell makes Prestone and Fram (ph) auto products. those were for sale before the big merger. It makes sense they might still be for sale.
Val, Fred.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

MORRIS: All right. But Peter when we look at this is this not the first time that the Europeans have blocked a merger between two U.S. companies and so is this a dangerous precedent?

VILES: Well, it certainly is a precedent and the Bush administration was speaking out yesterday how disappointed they were in this, how they do think it is a big issue and there probably will be more heard on this that American companies feel that the standard maybe should be a little more similar between Washington and Brussels.
They`re completely different standards and this is the first time the standards have stopped a deal that the American regulators said was OK. But bear in mind, the people complaining in Brussels to stop this deal were American companies. So, it`s not as if something bad happened to GE and Honeywell in Europe that had nothing to do with American business. It was United Technologies that went over there and complained and said we don`t like this deal. So, American companies are playing both sides of the street on this.

KATAYAMA: Pete, Larry Bossity, as you mentioned earlier worked for Jack Welch at GE before. He`s a respected businessman. What`s the world on Wall Street as to whether Bossity as head of Honeywell this time will sue GE for not pushing the merger hard enough?

VILES: Well, there`s a lot of speculation on that and yesterday the favorite speculation among analysts was that Larry Bossity would be less likely to sue GE than perhaps would Michael Bonsignore. But this is a very complicated issue. It`s not necessarily whether you think the right thing to do is to sue General Electric. You also have to think your shareholders might sue you if you don`t sue General Electric because the shareholders are angry that they`re not getting that General Electric stock and they want some recourse. But the two companies are still engaged. The Europeans have said you can`t get married, but they`re still engaged. They still have a merger deal. Somehow that has to be unwound and that would be a negotiation between the two companies and there could be some sort of settlement fee. They unwind the negotiations and they agree not to sue each other. But you would look for a more cordial tone between Larry Bossity and Jack Welch, old friends and golfing buddies, as a matter of fact. They spoke this week and set up a golfing date.
MORRIS; OK. Peter Viles, thank you very much for the details. END

FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn ANCHOR, TALKING STOCKS: Once again, our guest is Michael Carty, equity strategist for New Millennium Advisors. And were "TALKING STOCKS."
VALERIE MORRIS, CNNfn ANCHOR, TALKING STOCKS: And you can too. Give a call or an e-mail. The
number by phone 1800 304-FNET and the e-mail address is moneygang@cnnfn.com. Michael, as we were going
to break, I was doing my rear-view mirror theory that we know what`s happened behind us. It does help you to
orchestrate, negotiate with yourself, whatever, what the future could or should be. Some pretty big happenings
this week. I`m speaking specifically of the  Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) , GE (URL:
http://www.ge.com/) merger that kind of got scotched a bit. First of all, your response and your reaction to that
deal and then secondarily, do you think a dangerous precedent has been set in light of the fact that it`s two US
companies that  European regulators were able to impact?

MICHAEL CARTY, NEW MILLENNIUM ADVISORS: I think therein lies the greatest danger to the whole thing. First off, we are holders of Honeywell. I was sort of hoping the deal would go through. We were not holding GE because I really couldn`t get into a good entry level on the stocks for a while. And I was very interested in seeing that the United States antitrust division of the Justice Department, basically was ready, willing and able to let that merger happen and that meant to me that they would have an economic scale that would enable them to do a great many things. Now because the antitrust -- because the antitrust regulatory agencies in Europe have gone against the merger and decided to try to strip enough out of them so they wouldn`t make any

economic sense, it tells me that they`re running more protectionist than we ever did in the sense that they`re trying to defend against possibly the Airbus and to defend the subcontractors against what might be a very big merger here in the United States. But if our antitrust authorities are happy with the merger, I don`t see why the
European antitrust regulators should be unhappy with it.

MORRIS: I understand though that there were Americans in Europe who were the ones that were actually complaining. I think that`s what Jim Waggoner had said.
KATAYAMA: Rivals of GE. MORRIS: Yes.
CARTY: Well, that`s the point. It`s the same thing with the Microsoft antitrust thing. There are many rivals who will go out and lobby very hard to try to get a company to bust it up or weaken so that it enhances their competitive position, but I don`t necessarily think that that`s in the best interest of the public.

KATAYAMA: Well, Michael, we`ve seen a lot of cross-border transactions between the US and Europe especially in the area of pharmaceuticals and the brokerage sector as well. With the fallout from GE and Honeywell (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) , do you think this will -- you know, throw water on deals in the future between the two regions?

CARTY: Well I think it`s sort of (INAUDIBLE) makes for a lot of hard feelings on both sides, simply because, this merger did not go through and it probably won`t. Now with new leadership at Honeywell, I understand earlier today there was an announcement that the new CEO is saying he wants this to be stand alone, but Honeywell has not been acting very well in terms of its market performance has been OK. But fundamentally it hasn`t been acting very well simply because everyone`s been focused pretty much on the merger. What happens when you pull them apart, all of a sudden there`s no more premium price in the Honeywell deal and that can`t collapse

Page 160 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
unless they find another white knight and you know, struggling to be independent may preclude that from happening.

MORRIS: To wrap this subject up because we do have someone waiting on the phone, are you anticipating lawsuits and are they going to fly both directions? How do you see that?

CARTY: I really don`t know. Right now I`m shocked that they let the thing go as far as it did and my concern is that there could be lawsuits, I don`t know, but I -- I`m concerned as a Honeywell shareholder just what`s going to happen and I want to get a much clearer picture as to why they feel they should be independent.
KATAYAMA: All right, let`s go on now to America`s heartland in Missouri. Dracy (ph) has a question for Michael
Carty. Hello Dracy.

CALLER: Hello, good afternoon Michael. I have a question on Redback Networks (URL: http://www.redbacknetworks.com/) . Your opinion on maybe a long term, four year stock price and is the company strong enough to survive?

CARTY: I -- I`m -- I was very happy to see Redback climb the way it did, but it seems to be -- it doesn`t -- I -- I don`t really believe that this company is going to be able to be a dominant player over the next -- over the short term and even over the long term. It just seems to me too small and doesn`t have enough of a track record to do that and there are bigger players around that can do it better in terms of networking. We mentioned just earlier that Juniper Networks in fact has been taking away market share from Cisco Systems (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) , but Cisco certainly is one of the strong dominant players as well. And Redback, I`ve never been interested in the stock for that reason, although I have looked at it from time to time to see if there might be something useful to put it into some portfolios, but I`ve never been able to do that.
MORRIS: Tracy, thanks for your question. Our next caller is Leonard from Idaho. Hi, Leonard. CALLER: Hi.
MORRIS: What`s your question?

CALLER: I would like to know what the long and short term of Palm (URL:  http://www.palm.com/) may be in your future and if you would buy right now and I`ll sit back and listen and thanks and have a nice 4th of July.

CARTY: OK. Thank you. Palm, of course, has lost a lot. The orders have not been growing with Palm. The sales have not been growing with Palm and in fact announced that they`re not going to be meetiing analysts` expectations. Under that scenario, I believe that, and not only that, you`ve got other bigger players who want to do handhelds. So I think while Palm was a big player because it was sort of the first in the gate and it`s captured a good portion of the market share, I think the market is now lucrative enough from the big players who want to step in and I would defer purchases of Palm and if I was holding it, I would in fact, there is one client of mine who was giving it to me as part of another portfolio and I`m planning on liquidating it.

KATAYAMA: All right. And on this Independence Day, I think it`s appropriate that we take our next question from Benjamin Franklin`s state of Pennsylvania where the Liberty Bell is housed. Mike, your question for Michael Carty.

CALLER: Yes, good afternoon Mike. I would like your long-term outlook on two stocks in the communications field: Loral (URL:  http://www.loral.com/) and Aither (ph) Systems and they`ve been pretty well beaten down. Would you be buying at these levels? I`ll hang up and listen to your opinion. Thank you.

CARTY: OK, Loral Systems, I think that Loral Systems is a good stock to be buying into. I think this is even a reasonably good entry point. I`m not familiar with the other one but Loral is a company that I`ve watched for quite a long time. My brother in fact has worked for one of their companies they took over, Goodyear Tire (URL: http://www.goodyear.com/) . And it`s been a good company for a long time. It does make strong components, good systems and it got good senior scientific personnel. So this is a good company. It`s just a question that this is not -- this is not the right time for most companies because of the economic conditions, but this is a well-run company and when we strengthen economically, that company will be there and it will be there in the market.
MORRIS: In New York, we have a caller. His name is Bill. Hi, Bill. What`s your question for Michael?

CALLER: Yes, how are you? My question is on Nokia (URL:  http://www.nokia.com/) . I`d like to know the future of it. And have a nice holiday and thank you very much.

Page 161 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CARTY: OK. Thank you. You have a good holiday, too. I happen to be very positive on Nokia. Nokia is the largest provider of these mobile phones. They recently signed a licensing agreement with...
MORRIS: QUALCOMM (URL:  http://www.qualcomm.com/) .

CARTY: QUALCOMM and in fact both of these companies are going to benefit from that. Nokia was one of the last handouts for it -- holdouts for it and what they`ve done is they`ve gone ahead and they`ve decided that there`s now a whole new technology, CMDA, which is wide band and Nokia, by going into the agreement with QUALCOMM seems to have indicated that they`re now recognized that the next phase for this kind of wireless is in that area, the CDMA and that`s a big, big step because all of a sudden, it opens up a whole new avenue for telecommunications and, of course, QUALCOMM`s technology being embedded in the Nokia mobile phone maybe -- makes this a dynamic combination.
MORRIS: Do you think this is an extremely significant event, significant enough that you`d add it to your portfolio? CARTY: I am seriously considering adding QUALCOMM and Nokia at this moment because of that.
MORRIS: All right, on that, we will take a break. TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL

BUSINESS
REJECTEDEurope's veto of the GE-Honeywell merger costs Michael Bonsignore his job and raises
political tensions
Neal St. Anthony; Staff Writer
1,059 words
4 July 2001
Star-Tribune Newspaper of the Twin Cities Mpls.-St. Paul

Michael Bonsignore's resignation as CEO of Honeywell International came only hours after European                
regulators killed General Electric's  planned purchase of  Honeywell.
But Bonsignore's downfall was a slow-motion affair that began with his decision to merge the Minneapolis-based
Honeywell  Inc. with AlliedSignal just over two years ago.

From the start, some questioned the wisdom of combining Honeywell, best known for its high-tech avionics business and emphasis on growing sales, with the New Jersey-based Allied, a maker of auto parts and other products that was most famous for the zeal of its CEO to make the bottom line.

That CEO, Lawrence Bossidy, stayed in charge of the combined company until the spring of 2000, when he ceded control to Bonsignore. Bonsignore almost immediately landed in trouble as CEO, finding himself forced to back away from his predictions that the combined company would hit 12-to-15 percent growth in earnings.

By fall, the integration of Honeywell and AlliedSignal was clearly off track and the combined company became an acquisition target first for United Technologies and then GE.

Bonsignore continued as CEO after the GE deal was announced in October, but more as caretaker than chief executive; his effective time as head of the merged Honeywell - six months.
One of Bonsignore's last acts as CEO was to offer to cut the price for which he'd sell Honeywell to GE by about
$2 billion. The idea was to give GE wiggle room to sell assets and meet the concerns of European regulators. GE
rejected the offer.

Now Bossidy, 66, is coming back from retirement to take control, a move that some find ironic in that the AlliedSignal end of the business is viewed as having caused the most problems for the company over the past year.

"I'm sure AlliedSignal is the dominant coalition within the Honeywell board," said Fred Zimmerman, a professor of management and technology at the University of St. Thomas and a critic of the Honeywell-Allied merger.

"It may be that Bonsignore didn't do everything right, but much of the trouble with the merger stemmed from the practices within AlliedSignal. It's a sad ending . . . for employees and shareholders," Zimmerman said.
It's hardly the ending that shareholders envisioned.

Honeywell's stock closed at $35.10 per share Tuesday, slightly above half the level Honeywell shares traded at when it began its merger odyssey.

For more than a century, Honeywell was based in Minneapolis. It closed its headquarters here in late 1999, idling hundreds of workers. So far this year it has laid off about 800 more Minnesota employees at Twin Cities plants and elsewhere.
Still more changes

Page 163 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The company still has about 6,400 Minnesota workers, although Tuesday's announcement from Honeywell headquarters in New Jersey made it clear that those workers face still more changes.

"It is time to leave behind the distractions of the past several months and to immediately implement a laser-sharp focus on consistently meeting our financial commitments and our customers' needs," Bossidy said. He added that the company would cut costs and "deal decisively" with its issues.

There will be some unspecified job cuts, but Bossidy said his focus now is on keeping talented workers who were looking elsewhere because of the pending GE deal. He also said he envisioned no significant divestitures of company assets for now.

Bossidy said he has been given a year to right Honeywell and make it work as an independent company. The company's board will then revisit the issue of whether to stay independent or again seek a merger partner.
Some question whether Honeywell is worth more in parts than as a whole.

Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York City, said Bossidy could break the company into as many as a dozen pieces for sale.

"You could end up getting more value from the parts, by a good margin, than you could for the whole mass," Heymann said.
Analyst Steve Roorda at American Express Financial Advisors in Minneapolis said last week that the disarray at
Honeywell could take any CEO at least two years to fix.
Subject to infighting?

Anis Bouayad, a Paris-based merger consultant for AB Conseils, said the failures of the recent past might leave the company subject to "infighting and trying to find who failed and why."

Zimmerman also noted that Bossidy's previous fame for delivering the earnings that Wall Street wanted was helped by aggressive accounting practices.
SEC Insight, a Minneapolis-based research firm that examines public company documents, noted that SEC
officials questioned Allied's accounting and disclosure practices in 1999, just before the Honeywell deal.

"Allied was a company with low-growth businesses in several sectors that used accounting gimmicks," Zimmerman said. "They would take big reserves on restructurings and acquisitions and then take the surplus into income in the next quarter."

It was unclear Tuesday whether Bonsignore, 60, plans to retire or enter some new venture. The statement announcing his retirement from Honeywell said its board of directors wished him well as he "enters an exciting new stage of his life."

His standing as an executive has clearly been damaged, despite the turnaround he engineered after taking over Honeywell in the early '90s, and the string of strong profits and record of community giving in the Twin Cities that followed.

"I don't think Bonsignore handled all this very well," said Miles Berryman, a money manager at J.P. Morgan. "And it was a slap in the face for Honeywell shareholders that they went to GE and offered themselves at a lower price. It was a move that seemed desperate."
Several of Bonsignore's former lieutenants said last fall that Honeywell's strategic plan never envisioned a
big-bang merger like the deal with Allied. Instead, they said Honeywell was supposed to grow organically and
through selected acquisitions within its business lines of aircraft controls and residential and industrial controls.

Now Honeywell must deliver under Bossidy, or possibly be selectively dismembered to give shareholders the return they want.

Honeywell  CEO is out in wake of deal's defeat - With merger partner sent packing,  Bossidy is back in the

Honeywell  International Inc.'s top executive, Michael Bonsignore, quit last night after  European regulators put an end to General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion acquisition of the Morris Township-based company.

Honeywell's  board immediately named former AlliedSignal chief Lawrence Bossidy chairman and chief executive, giving him a year to turn around the troubled company and keep it independent.

"We will move quickly and aggressively to improve our performance, further strengthen the management team and rebuild the confidence of our shareowners, customers and employees," Bossidy said in a statement.

The move is the latest twist in an eight-month saga that began when United Technologies bid for Honeywell, whose fortunes were sagging as demand ebbed for its products, which range from chemicals to aircraft electronics to home security systems.

At the last minute, General Electric stepped in to trump United Technologies and give famed Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch one last deal to complete before retiring. The acquisition won easy approval from U.S. regulators, but ran afoul of European antitrust officials, who feared it would give one company too much control of the market for jet engines and airline parts.

In the meantime, Honeywell has foundered, missing one profit target after another. The company warned yesterday that it would not meet analysts' forecasts for the period ended June 30.

It is also an uncertain time for Honeywell's 120,000 employees around the globe, including more than 2,300 spread between its Morris Township headquarters and offices in Teterboro and Freehold. GE had planned to slash thousands of those jobs. Their fate now is unknown.

What is certain is that those workers will get an executive with a reputation for delivering results with a hard-driving, relentless style.

The 66-year-old Bossidy spent much of his career at GE, working his way up to be Welch's No. 2 executive as head of GE Capital Services, the behemoth financial services arm of the company.

He stepped out of Welch's shadow a decade ago, moving to New Jersey to take the helm of AlliedSignal. He quickly boosted profitability of the staid manufacturer and turned the company into an international force.
His crowning achievement was acquiring Honeywell in 1999, after which he became chairman. He retired in April
2000, a move that made Bonsignore, 60, the former top executive at Honeywell, chairman and chief executive.

"It is time to leave behind the distractions of the past several months and to immediately implement a laser-sharp focus on consistently meeting our financial commitments and customers' needs," he said.

The same announcement, though, contained the news that Honeywell would have a second-quarter operating profit of 53 cents to 55 cents a share. That will be down from 75 cents in the same period a year ago and below analysts' expectations of 60 cents.

Earlier in the day, the European Union finally rejected the merger with GE, a move expected for days.

That action was the first time European regulators prevented a deal that had been approved by U.S. regulators. Some U.S. officials expressed concern of a possible trade war yesterday.

The merger between GE and Honeywell "would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario
Monti said in a statement.
Honeywell shares closed up 99 cents yesterday to $35.10. GE stock fell 80 cents to finish at $49.40.

GE said it was "deeply disappointed" by the decision. GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said no decision had been made on whether to appeal. An appeal could block Honeywell from finding another merger partner.

"In Honeywell's case, you are left with a CEO who doesn't have an obvious plan B," Jay Barney, a management professor at Ohio State University, said before the Bonsignore resignation.

D.C. BLASTS THE EU - O'NEILL SLAMS MONTI MEDDLING; WILL W ACT?

It didn't take Washington long to respond angrily and loudly to the  European Union's decision to blow away  GE's planned merger with Honeywell.
But now the question remains: So what are they going to do about it?

The Bush administration roundly blasted European mergers czar Mario Monti for shooting down the deal - the first time a merger between two U.S. companies has been rejected by the Europeans.

Bush's top economics adviser, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, criticized Monti and his regulatory underlings at the European Union for unfairly "reaching into the affairs of other countries" to protect EU nations from competition.

O'Neill said the EU process for reviewing mergers is "flawed" and "needs correction . . . especially in those cases where they are making judgments about business combinations of companies that are located completely outside their jurisdiction, such as General Electric and Honeywell, which are both headquartered in the United States."

The Justice Department also criticized the EU's unanimous 20-vote decision, saying its probe of the matter had entirely opposite findings and that the deal "would have been pro-competitive and beneficial" to customers worldwide.

"For years, U.S. and EU competition authorities have enjoyed close and cooperative relations," said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Charles James in charge of mergers. "This matter points to the continuing need for consultation to move toward greater policy convergence."

Bush and Monti went eyeball-to-eyeball over the merger - and Monti certainly didn't blink. In the process he has confirmed his status as a hero among European peers and supporters.

Monti's victory, however, could backfire if the Bush adminstration puts its money where its mouth is. The U.S. could mire the EU in a new round of retaliatory trade snags in the already tangled trade front between the U.S. and its biggest trading partner.

Yesterday, a U.S. congressional study labeled the EU the worst trading partner for imposing levies on goods sold at below-cost discounts in their markets, so-called anti-dumping duties.
It the past, the U.S. had been the biggest user of those protectionistic duties, but the new report by the
Congressional Budget Office said the EU now tops the list.
The EU is imposing an average 21.2 new anti-dumping penalties annually on violators in its markets, while the
U.S. is imposing 16.4 penalties for violations in the U.S. markets, the report said.

Trade experts say it's not clear whether the GE-Honeywell debacle will flare into all-out trade war, with the U.S. imposing bigger tariffs or outright bans on goods from Europe, and Europe firing back with the same tactics at U.S. goods and services.
--------- Take that!

Words were flying fast and furious yesterday after the European Union ignored a warning from President Bush and torpedoed the GE-Honeywell deal.
WHAT THEY SAID:

* U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said the EU Commission should quit "reaching into the affairs of other countries." He said its merger review process is "flawed" and "needs correction."

* EU Competition Czar Mario Monti said he was "distinctly unimpressed by any political pressure exercised from within or outside the European Union."

Jack Welch's Legacy
538 words
4 July 2001
The New York Times
NYTF
Page 14, Column 1
English
(c) 2001 New York Times Company
Yesterday the  European Commission officially decided to block  General Electric's  merger with Honeywell.  For G.E.'s chief executive officer, John F. Welch Jr., the deal would have been the capstone of an illustrious 20-year career at the helm of one of the world's biggest corporations. Now, in his last six months as boss, he has to clean up the aftermath of the botched  merger instead. It is a last act that casts a shadow on Mr. Welch's reputation as an infallible visionary. But if he wants to leave his post on a heroic note, he could readily do so by turning his attention to a different, longstanding problem on which he has been stubbornly retrograde -- the overdue need to cleanse the Hudson River of PCB's.

Mr. Welch has no truly attractive options for climbing free of the botched merger with Honeywell. He could do nothing and risk a lawsuit by Honeywell, whose board greeted G.E.'s abandoning of the merger with anger and disappointment. He could reformulate G.E.'s bid for Honeywell to make it more palatable to the commission, a move that would probably result in months of delays and, from Wall Street's perspective, a value-poor deal. Or he could challenge the commission's decision in the European Union's Court of First Instance, maintaining his reputation as a fighter but burdening his successor, Jeffrey Immelt, with a long legal battle.

Mr. Welch, however, does have a fine chance to burnish his legacy of decisive action. He can end his company's long legal battle against paying to dredge the Hudson River to remove polychlorinated biphenyls, cancer-causing chemicals known as PCB's. It could even be argued that the savings in legal fees and the public-relations benefits would increase shareholder value in the long run.

Over 100,000 pounds of PCB's, discharged from two upriver G.E. plants, lie mingled with sediment on the floor of the Hudson. These chemicals do not biodegrade quickly and continue to leach into the water. Though G.E. curtailed its dumping in 1977, the E.P.A. showed in 1999 that the cancer risk to those who eat the upper Hudson's fish is 1,000 times higher than acceptable. In December the E.P.A. proposed that G.E. spend a half-billion dollars over five years to dredge the Hudson. The agency will formalize its plan by the end of August, at which point G.E. could go along with a government-monitored cleanup or go to court to fight the E.P.A., whose scientific
conclusions the company's officials continue to dispute.

Jack Welch has battled the environmental agency and the state for 10 years in an attempt to minimize G.E.'s responsibility. Further bickering and litigation would certainly conform to precedent. Yet this would be a particularly advantageous time for Mr. Welch to agree to a cleanup. He would help clear the agenda for his successor and would also be remembered for a noble, if belated, gesture toward the environment and the people of New York, rather than for a blockbuster merger gone sour.

A front-page article yesterday about the effect of the collapse of the  merger between General Electric  and Honeywell  International on the reputation of G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr., misstated the title of his successor, Jeffrey R. Immelt. He is president and chairman-elect, not chief executive.

The article also misidentified the company acquired by the Boeing Company in 1997 in a deal nearly blocked by the European Commission. It was the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, not the Lockheed Martin Corporation.

Europe blocks  GE-Honeywell  plan for merger --- EC regulators fear firm might dominate  market for jet
engines

The European Union blocked General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion (U.S.) purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. yesterday, the first time a proposed merger between two U.S. companies has been stopped solely by  European regulators.

The veto of one of the world's largest industrial mergers by the EU's 20-member executive  commission was widely expected after the American companies failed to allay European fears that the merged company would dominate markets for jet engines and aircraft electronics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell as it was notified would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU competition commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

A statement from the commission added that while GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, "the remedies proposed . . . were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns."
The commission's decision was unanimous.
It came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues. A statement from GE said the company was "deeply disappointed" with the decision.
"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," the statement said.
GE spokesperson Gary Sheffer said the company has not decided whether it will appeal the ruling.
In the statement, GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch referred to the decision as a "setback."

Nicholas Heymann, a General Electric analyst with Prudential Securities, said the response suggested GE may appeal the decision.
"It's a very good chance," Heymann said. "I think that remains a very real possibility."

Honeywell spokesperson Tom Crane said, "We're disappointed in their decision," referring to the European commission's veto.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

However, the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities has raised American hackles.

U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible "chilling effect" on trans-Atlantic relations.

Page 172 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Even U.S. President George W. Bush expressed concern.
EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust co-operation is generally good.

As evidence, Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close co-operation between the agencies.

Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal WorldCom-Sprint was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.

On Friday, GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell. Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.
Yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, General Electric shares fell 69 cents (U.S.) to close at $49.51, while
Honeywell shares gained 99 cents to close at $35.10 a share.

NEW YORK -- Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41-billion US purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. Tuesday, although GE chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal to this "setback."

It was the first time a proposed  merger between two American companies had been blocked solely by  European regulators. Analysts said this appeared to kill what would have been one of the world's largest-ever industrial mergers.
But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the
European Union's Competition Commission.

The commission's ruling had been widely expected after the companies failed to allay European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.

The only other apparent option besides giving up on the merger would be for GE and Honeywell to start the merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the commission.
Analysts said the odds are against a successful appeal.

European Union Kills  GE Deal

BRUSSELS, July 3 -- The  European Union today rejected General Electric's  proposed $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell  International, a move that blocks what would have been the biggest industrial  merger ever and may exacerbate tensions with the United States over how to manage  competition in the global economy.

The unanimous decision by the 20 members of the  European Commission, the EU's executive body, marks the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies was killed solely by foreign regulators. President
Bush and leading U.S. legislators had lobbied for the deal, but the campaign backfired when EU antitrust officials angrily objected to such political pressure.

The action also denied GE's legendary chairman and chief executive, John F. Welch Jr., the capstone he had sought to his 20-year career. Welch, viewed by some as one of the greatest corporate managers of the last century, had postponed his retirement to see the deal through, and he made no effort to hide his disappointment as the EU's opposition became apparent in recent weeks.

Meanwhile, Honeywell's board of directors announced today in New York that chairman and CEO Michael R. Bonsignore would resign, effective immediately, after 31 years with the company. The board said it would replace him with Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and CEO of AlliedSignal Corp., which acquired Honeywell and adopted its name in 1999.

The U.S. Justice Department approved the GE-Honeywell deal, with minor alterations, in May. But the EU veto came after the two companies failed to alleviate European fears that the merger would have squelched competition and allowed GE to ultimately gain a near-monopoly in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," said Mario Monti, the EU's top antitrust official. He noted that although the companies offered various concessions over eight months of negotiations, the suggested remedies were insufficient to resolve concerns that GE could someday abuse its potentially dominant position.

Although not surprised by the EU's action, GE expressed sharp disagreement with the European conclusions. GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said, "We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices."

GE said it was incomprehensible that EU antitrust officials could take such a strikingly disparate approach toward a deal that was approved in the United States, Canada and a dozen other jurisdictions. Within the U.S. government, the reaction has been similar.

The Justice Department issued a statement today reaffirming its conclusion. "The merger, as modified by the remedies we insisted upon, would have been pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers," said Charles A. James, assistant attorney general for antitrust.

Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said last week that an EU rejection of the deal would be "off the wall." And U.S. senators such as John D. "Jay" Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) and Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) warned that thwarting the merger would damage transatlantic relations and compel retaliatory action by Washington.

After lashing out two weeks ago against American pressure tactics, Monti took a conciliatory approach today at a news conference in Strasbourg, France, where the European Commission accepted his recommendation to kill the deal. He emphasized that U.S. and European antitrust officials had worked well together in the past and that their collaboration must be strengthened to cope with the expansive reach of global corporations.
But he acknowledged that the different interpretation reached by the Justice Department, which expressed none
of the qualms about the deal voiced by European regulators, was a troubling break in that tradition. "I, for one, am
genuinely interested in understanding better why this divergence occurred," Monti said.

Multinational companies are required to follow the laws of all the countries in which they operate. Because global companies affect markets far beyond their headquarters, both EU and U.S. antitrust authorities review the mergers of foreign companies with substantial activities within their jurisdictions.

EU officials said that much of the misunderstanding over the outcome of the GE-Honeywell deal may be attributed to the extraordinary power wielded by European regulators, who, in effect, act as judge, jury and prosecutor in antitrust cases. Instead of arguing their case in court, as U.S. regulators do, EU antitrust officials make their own judgments after listening to the arguments of the companies involved and their competitors.

In the GE-Honeywell case, EU officials gave close attention to the warnings of companies that make jet engines, notably United Technologies and Rolls-Royce, and avionics firms such as Rockwell International. Those three firms, among the most vociferous opponents of the merger, contended their earnings would be devastated by General Electric's ability to slash prices by combining sales of jet engines and cockpit controls with financial credit from GE Capital, which is often needed to pay for such expensive equipment.

In addition, GE Capital Aviation Services is the world's largest plane-leasing business and accounts for about 10 percent of all aircraft purchased in the world. European regulators said it could give General Electric an unfair advantage in demanding the use of Honeywell avionics on all plane purchases, just as it does with GE engines.

Monti's staff argued that such enormous clout in "bundling" products across several markets might temporarily lead to lower prices but ultimately would cause GE's rivals to go out of business. That, in turn, would clear the
way for GE to gain a near-monopoly in which it could dictate much higher prices without fear of being undercut by competitors. It was that argument, EU officials said, that prompted more than a dozen airline companies -- European and American -- to testify against the merger.

GE's lawyers and economists argued that there was no reason to think that a company that purchases only 10 percent of the world's planes would have enough leverage over big, sophisticated buyers such as Boeing Co. and Airbus to force them to buy engines or avionics they didn't prefer. They also said it was absurd for the commission to block a merger out of fear that it would lower prices to consumers, on the basis of speculation that it might someday drive some competitor out of the market.

But last month, after realizing how fiercely Monti was defending the bundling argument, Welch virtually threw in the towel. Welch acknowledged on June 14 that the deal was doomed when he commented publicly that Monti's demands "exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined."

EU Rejection  Shows Divergence  of World's  Rules

The conflicting American and  European rulings on General Electric  Co.'s proposed acquisition of  Honeywell International Inc. have exposed one of the dirty little secrets about the global economy: In many areas, there still aren't any global rules to govern the behavior of global companies.

While the  EU concluded the merger would stifle  competition, antitrustregulators in the United States, Canada and elsewhere said the deal was fine with them.

From bank regulations to labor standards to environmental controls, each country still sets its own standards that companies are expected to adhere to if they operate anywhere within its borders. Past attempts to replace the cross-border hodgepodge with international rules have usually met strong resistance, and nowhere more so than in the United States, where any hint of surrendering sovereignty to some form of "world government" is met with howls of protest.

The transatlantic conflict over the GE-Honeywell deal is "not a one-of-a-kind phenomenon -- it will recur with increasing frequency," said Eleanor Fox, an antitrust expert at New York University.

Most of the time, Europe and the United States do agree about mergers. But in the GE-Honeywell case, there has been widespread suspicion among American politicians and business executives that the EU's move was a backdoor effort to protect the European aerospace industry from American competition.

A number of antitrust experts said, however, that the Europeans were simply applying a different set of economic and legal theories.

The essence of the difference between the two approaches is that the aim of the European law is to protect competition -- and at times, threatened competitors -- while U.S. law focuses more directly on protecting consumers.

Europeans are more suspicious of proposed mergers that might make one firm dominant in a market -- even if it might also lower prices to customers in the short term. U.S. officials argue that even mergers involving dominant firms are acceptable if they lower prices or make an industry more efficient.

Europeans worry more about mergers between customers and suppliers -- for example, an automaker and a tiremaker. American law in recent years has tended to treat such "vertical" mergers as largely benign unless one or the other company already has a near-monopoly.

Finally, European law allows regulators to speculate more on what might happen to competition in the long run. American courts, by contrast, have insisted on much harder proof of how a merger will affect things, with a focus on the short and medium term.
All of these differences played into the divergent rulings on the GE-Honeywell case.

From the beginning, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic worried that by merging the world's biggest producer of jet engines (GE) and the biggest producer of avionics (Honeywell), the combined resulting company could be able to offer airplane makers lower prices for a "bundled" package that no other engine or avionics company could match.
Page 177 of 178 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GE commissioned studies by economists Barry Nalebuff of Yale University and Carl Shapiro of the University of California at Berkeley to show that although bundling often works in other industries, it wouldn't work in the aircraft market because the buyers -- Boeing and Airbus -- were so strong and sophisticated and all prices were already subject to extensive negotiation. And even if it turned out that the new company did offer discounted bundles, said GE's lawyers, the winners would be the airlines and, ultimately, their passengers.

In rebuttal, Rolls-Royce PLC, one of the two other engine makers, submitted a study by Jay Choi of Michigan State University showing that GE could gain market share by offering lower prices for engines and avionics bought in a bundle, while raising prices for the same products bought separately.

Choi predicted that competitors would have no choice but to match GE's low prices, depriving them of the profits needed to invest in next-generation technology. Without new products, the companies would wither away.

Justice Department officials rejected Choi's conclusion. "Our conclusion was based on findings, confirmed by customers worldwide, that the combined firm would offer better products and services at more attractive prices than either firm could offer individually," explained James yesterday. "That, in our view, is the essence of competition.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti concluded that GE's ability to bundle products was one of several factors that would eventually allow it to dominate the market.

Monti was more concerned about the impact of GE Capital Aviation Services, GE's airplane leasing division, the world's largest airplane buyer.

Janusz Ordover, an economist at New York University hired by engine maker United Technologies Corp., testified that GECAS would only buy planes that had GE engines and electronics. More significantly, he said, GE would leverage its position as a major customer to persuade Boeing or Airbus to use only GE engines and avionics for new planes it planned to add to its line, eventually driving its rivals out of business.

Over the past decade, of more than 600 planes purchased by GECAS, only four did not have GE engines. Lawyers for the competitors also pointed out that in return for putting in a $2 billion advance order for the new long-range version of Boeing's 777 jet, GE was designated the exclusive engine supplier for the plane.

GE countered that as buyer of only 10 percent of the world's airplanes, it didn't have enough clout to make such a strategy work.
The Americans agreed. The Europeans didn't buy it. Document wp00000020010713dx7401066
