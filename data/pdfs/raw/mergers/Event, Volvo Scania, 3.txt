EU Commission stops Volvo's  acquisition of Scania

15 March 2000

The EU Commission today rejected  Volvo's application for competition approval of  Volvo's proposed acquisition of Scania.

This means that Volvo does not have the possibility to complete the acquisition of Investor's  Scania shares and the public offer to Scania's shareholders.

"Together with Scania, we had the ambition to build an EU-based company with the best conceivable prospects to compete globally with the large players in the industry. I regret that the EU Commission, through today's decision, is stopping these plans for reasons that seem to go against the basic concept of the common market", says Volvo's CEO Leif Johansson.

"Within Volvo, we must look ahead and move onward with the work to strengthen our global competitiveness, which includes continued investment and further development of our other business areas," continued Leif Johansson.

Volvo's current holding in Scania, which amounts to 30.6% of the votes and 45.5% of the capital, is not affected directly by the EU Commission's decision. The shares were acquired at an average price of SEK 266 per share, or a total of slightly more than SEK 24 billion. Volvo intends to retain this holding at this time.
However, Volvo does not intend to request a position on Scania's Board of Directors.
"We will now follow the continuing developments, but in the short term we foresee no need to divest our shares in
Scania", says Leif Johansson.

The EU Commission's decision means that the intended integration of Volvo and Scania will not be carried out. The companies will now evaluate whether other forms of future cooperation are possible.

"It is natural that many questions arise as a result of the EU Commission's decision. However, I hope that there is understanding for the fact that today we do not have definitive answers to all questions. We must now evaluate the other possible alternatives," continued Leif Johansson.

Volvo's offer to shareholders in Scania was conditional upon receipt of the necessary approval from the authorities for the acquisition of shares in Scania on terms acceptable to Volvo. As a result of the EU Commission's decision not to approve Volvo's acquisition of Scania, Volvo cannot complete the agreement to acquire Investor's holding in Scania nor the public offer to Scania's shareholders.

The shares tendered in the offer will be transferred back to the affected shareholders' VP-accounts as soon as possible, which is expected to occur on March 20, 2000. Additional information will be sent directly to the affected shareholders.

Scania's comment  in view of the decision by the EU Commission

M2 PRESSWIRE

Copyright 2000 M2 Communications, Ltd. All Rights Reserved.
Against the background of the decision by the  EU Commission not to approve the proposed acquisition of  Scania
by Volvo, Scania's President and CEO Leif Ostling makes the following comments:

"Regrettably, the handling of this issue has taken a long time. The uncertain situation during more than one year has naturally put strain on the company and its sales organisation. Despite this uncertainty, I conclude that in the short perspective  Scania has not sustained serious damage.

"Scania's owner structure is obviously an issue for our shareholders. But at the same time I must declare that the present uncertainty is not good for Scania. Long-term ownership stability is a necessity for Scania's continued development as a publicly listed company.

"Demand for heavy commercial vehicles, particularly in western Europe, developed strongly, as evidenced by our very good financial performance in 1999. During the first months of this year, demand and capacity utilisation remain good.

"Extensive product renewal over the past few years in combination with strong market growth has made Scania a very healthy company. We now concentrate on producing good results this year.

"Industrially, Scania now continues to develop its business as an independent actor, irrespective of the current ownership structure. This means for example that the joint preparatory planning between Volvo and Scania, which was initiated by the integration committee in August 1999, is now discontinued. Long- term, this does not preclude future co-operation regarding some non-strategic areas.

"My role as President and CEO of the company during the period since the offer was launched has primarily been to prioritise operations and ensure that Scania during this period has acted appropriately towards all parties involved. The Board and Group Management of Scania now focus on the future, with special attention to what is best for the company and for our customers in the long run."
For the time being, Scania has no further comments to the current situation.

EU Commission blocks  Volvo's  acquisition of Scania
273 words

NORDIC BUSINESS REPORT
NORD

Copyright 2000 M2 Communications, Ltd. All Rights Reserved.
The EU Commission has prohibited the Swedish truck maker  Volvo's proposed acquisition of its main competitor
Scania.

According to the Commission a merger of the companies would result in dominant positions in certain Nordic, Irish and UK truck and bus markets.

Volvo agreed to facilitate competitors' access to the markets by opening its dealer and service networks to competition and by divesting bus and coach bodybuilding plants in Denmark and Sweden, but according to the Commission these undertakings would not have been sufficient to remove the competition concerns.

A proposal of a new package of undertakings was submitted by Volvo on 7 March, but besides coming too late before a non-extendable legal deadline they were also not seen to provide an obvious and clear-cut way to remove the competition concerns, the Commission said.

Commenting on the Commission's decision, Volvo CEO Leif Johansson said that it seemed to go against the basic concept of the common market. Volvo has previously said that one of the main differences between the views of EU authorities and Volvo was that whereas Volvo regarded the market for heavy trucks and buses to be pan-European EU authorities saw each EU country as a separate market.

Scania CEO Leif Ostling said that he regretted that the issue had taken a long time and said that the uncertain situation had put a strain on Scania and its sales organisation. Both companies indicated that they would now evaluate the possibilities of other forms of future cooperation.

European Regulators Halt Truck and Aluminum Mergers
By JOHN TAGLIABUE

15 March 2000

NYTF

English
c. 2000 New York Times Company
PARIS, March 14 --  European antitrust regulators took some of their most strenuous action against big corporate mergers today, blocking a planned $7 billion purchase by  Volvo of the rival Swedish truck maker  Scania and forcing three large aluminum companies to withdraw their proposed $17 billion combination.

The moves by the  European Union's competition commission are not expected to slow the pace of global consolidation in the automotive and aluminum industries. But they reflected the rigorous standards set by Mario Monti, the chief  European antitrust regulator, who in his six months on the job has taken a far more aggressive position than his predecessors in examining the impact of mergers on competition.

In rejecting a combination of Volvo and Scania announced last year, Mr. Monti said such a merger would dominate the Scandinavian market and hold a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden.

Leif Johansson, the Volvo chief executive, said the decision appeared to ''go against the basic concept of the common market.''

Fears about opposition from Mr. Monti also led two aluminum companies, Alcan Aluminium of Canada and Pechiney of France to withdraw a proposal for a three-way merger with the Alusuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland. The regulators said that they would accept a combination of just Alcan and Alusuisse, but that a three-way deal including Pechiney would have to be modified.

The three companies announced in August that they intended to create the world's leading aluminum company, challenging the market leader, Alcoa of the United States.

Mr. Johansson of Volvo said his company had no plans to sell the Scania shares it now owns. Volvo holds 45.5 percent of Scania, and the proposed merger would have created the world's second-largest manufacturer of buses and trucks, after DaimlerChrysler.

Investors bid up the shares of the losers in the regulatory process, apparently in the expectation that either Volvo or Pechiney, or both, could come into play as possible takeover targets. Volvo stock rose 7 percent in Stockholm after the announcement, to 236 kronor, or $27.20, and shares of Pechiney gained more than 10 percent in Paris, closing at 57 euros, or $55.

Last year, Volvo sold its car-building division to Ford to concentrate on heavy trucks, after rejecting a bid by Fiat to buy the whole company. Recently, Volvo executives are said to have made preliminary contacts with several other rivals, including Renault of France, about a possible combination. Fiat, which on Monday announced a wide-reaching cooperation agreement with General Motors in the car business, is known to be considering whether to make an offer for Volvo.

Last August, Volvo announced its intention to take full control of Scania, forming a union of the world's No. 2 and No. 3 truck makers. To overcome regulatory objections, Volvo agreed to open its dealer network to the trucks of its competitors and to set a ceiling on its market share in the Scandinavian countries. But regulators said that even with such changes, the proposed acquisition was unacceptable because it would ''significantly change the market structure to the detriment of the customers.''

Since taking office, Mr. Monti, an economics professor and former dean of Bocconi University, a prestigious Italian business school, has sought to shift the emphasis in European antitrust policy from the fulfillment of legal requirements to an examination of the consequences on commercial competition. The result has been far tougher standards than were common in the past.

Since the latest European antitrust regulations were enacted in 1990, only 11 proposed mergers have been blocked, while 11 others were withdrawn in the face of probable refusal. But the proposed mergers affected today were the second and third Mr. Monti has stopped since taking up his post in September.

And the regulators are relying on support of their strict interpretation by European courts. In 1996, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg upheld one of the first major efforts by regulators to thwart a proposed merger on the basis of its consequences for commercial markets. It blocked a combination of two big platinum-dealing companies, Lonrho of Britain and Gencor of South Africa, declaring that the merged company would be able to effectively dictate platinum prices in Europe.

Similar concerns seem to have motivated the regulators' hard line on the proposed three-way aluminum deal. Mr. Monti appeared ready to allow a merger of Alcan and Alusuisse after those companies agreed to take steps to eliminate their dominant position in the market for aluminum trihydrate, a substance used for fireproofing and film manufacturing.

But he indicated that he would block a combination of Alcan and Pechiney because of its potentially dominant position in the European market for aluminum sheets used to make containers for food, drinks and sprays.

In similar statements, Alcan and Pechiney said today that they would resubmit their proposal for a merger. The companies are under particular pressure because of Alcoa's planned $6.3 billion acquisition of Reynolds Metals, which is under investigation by antitrust authorities both in Europe and the United States.

TIME RUNS OUT FOR VOLVO'S BID FOR SCANIA.

European Report

(c) 2000 European Report.
As expected, the European Commission's competition authorities officially blocked  Volvo's bid to take over its main rival, Scania, it confirmed late on March 14 (see also  European Report Number 2478). The Commission made the announcement after the  European Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, had managed to secure the backing of his fellow Commissioners at their weekly meeting held in Strasbourg on March 14.

It concluded in a statement that remedies proposed by  Volvo were insufficient as the deal would have created a dominant position in the markets for heavy goods vehicles in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Ireland; for coaches in Finland and the UK; for inner city buses in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland; and for the market for city buses in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Ireland.

On March 7, Volvo proposed a new series of concessions which could have reduced the merged group's market share in these sectors (which in some cases rose to as much as 90% - in the example of the Swedish heavy goods vehicle market). But the 'complex' package (as the Commission called it) simply could not be considered extensively in the limited time left for the Commission's Merger Task Force to investigate it - under present EU merger rules - as the legal deadline could not be extended.

STOCKHOLM - The European Commission blocked Swedish truck and busmaker AB Volvo's 60.7 billion crown
($10-billion) merger with rival Scania yesterday on competition grounds, the  EC and Volvo said.

Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson attacked the ruling -- correctly predicted by the market -- which he said seemed to go "against the basic concept of the common market."

Volvo shares rose 15.5 crowns to 236, while shares in Scania fell eight crowns to 250 when the market closed flat.

Auto industry analysts said the move put both companies into play in a rapid consolidation of the global vehicle industry, and Mr. Johansson agreed in a teleconference there could be bids.

"We certainly feel that we have the opportunity as a company to be in the driving seat to make acquisitions but we have also said that if good proposals come from outside, whatever the structure, we will look at them," he said.

Scania Chief Executive Leif Ostling said long-term co-operation between the companies was not ruled out. The merger would have created Europe's biggest heavy truckmaker.

The Commission said the proposed merger could have created dominant positions in the markets for heavy trucks and city buses in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Ireland, touring coaches in Finland and Britain and intercity buses in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland.

Volvo, which sold its car division to Ford last year, already co-operates with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Volvo plans eventually to take a 19.9% share of a new Mitsubishi subdisidary, including all the Japanese group's truck and bus operations. It has already bought 5% of Mitsubishi.

Volvo said it and Scania would now study whether other forms of co-operation were possible, and in the short term Volvo said it saw no need to divest its 45.5% Scania stake.

Report on Business: The Wall Street Journal
Full Monti revealed to Volvo, ScaniaEuropean Competition Commissioner pulls plug on another major
merger

Under fire for his decision to block a merger of Sweden's two big truck and bus makers,  European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti blamed the decision on  Europe's failure to build a true single market where companies can expand freely.

Conceding that his tough stance against dominance of national markets was delaying  European merger activity, Mr. Monti said the real problem was slow progress toward  European integration. "The best way out of this dilemma is deepening the single market," Mr. Monti said, adding that  Europe needed to change its treaties this year to hand more power to Brussels.

The decision to block the merger of Scania AB and Volvo AB was widely expected after the Commission, Europe's competition regulator, warned it was concerned about the merged company's market dominance in Sweden, Finland, Britain and Ireland, where it would have controlled between 50 and 90 per cent of sales.

But the move was a harsh blow to both companies, which have been set back a year and are once again looking for merger partners to compete in a fast-consolidating world truck and bus business. Volvo chief executive officer Leif Johansson attacked the ruling, which he said seemed to go "against the basic concept of the common market."

"This has put us in a complicated position," said Scania CEO Leif Oestling. The ruling was taken in the face of strong lobbying from Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson and dissent from Nordic members of the Commission, the 20-member panel which must sign off on Mr. Monti's decision. On the same day, Mr. Monti also blocked part of a three-way merger deal between Alusuisse Lonza Group AG, Alcan Aluminium Ltd. of Canada and Pechiney SA of France.

In a sign of the mounting political opposition to the decisions, Mr. Monti felt compelled to make a declaration that he had no political agenda and was not out to prove anything to European business. "I believe that mergers are generally pro-competition and have the potential to bring substantial efficiencies," he said. But Mr. Monti, who started his first day on the job by nixing a merger of two British tour operators, has now blocked two mergers in just five months, compared with 11 blocked mergers in the previous 10 years of the Commission.

The crux of the Commission's concerns over the Volvo-Scania merger was that the merged company would exert market dominance in countries like Sweden, where consumers were practically unable to take part in the single market. Mr. Monti cited barriers to cross-border trade such as national dealer networks and differing national technical standards on safety as proof of this problem. Moreover, in Sweden, he said, 25 per cent of trucks are owned by individuals who lack the resources to overcome the hassle required to shop around Europe. This logic plays badly in many European countries, which are looking to create national champions to fight their corner in
the global marketplace.

EC has no truck with Volvo merger.

VOLVO'S planned merger with rival Swedish truck and bus maker  Scania has been rejected by the  European
Commission.

Volvo's chief executive Leif Johansson said he regretted the decision, which he said seemed "to go against the basic concept of the common market".
Volvo currently holds 45.5 per cent of Scania and will hold on to its stake.

The EC launched a review of the planned takeover in October after it expressed concerns that the #4.3 billion merger would strengthen the company's already dominant position in the truck and bus market.

The EC voiced concerns that the proposed merger could have created dominant positions in a number of markets: these included heavy trucks and city buses in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Ireland; touring coaches in Finland and the UK; and intercity buses in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland.

WHILE CHALLENGING NEGATIVE COMMISSION DECISION ON  VOLVO/SCANIA MERGER, SWEDISH MANUFACTURER STUDIES OTHER POSSIBLE ALLIANCES - COMMISSIONER MONTI EXPLAINS.

Brussels, 15/03/2000 (Agence  Europe) - After the decision by the European Commission to ban the merger between the Swedish heavy vehicle manufacturers  Volvo and Scania (see yesterday's EUROPE, p.8),  Volvo suspended the acquisition of  Scania shares and is studying other possible alliances. European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti defended the Commission's decision against alleged partiality stressing the lack of competition on the Scandinavian market. This is the twelfth time in ten years that the Commission has banned a merger.

"Together with Scania, we had the ambition to build an EU-based company with the best conceivable prospects to compete globally with the large players in the industry. I regret that the EU Commission, through today's decision, is stopping these plans for reasons that seem to go against the basic concept of the common market", declared Volvo President Leif Johansson, in a press release. Last Sunday, the Social-Democrats in power in Sweden had adopted a motion calling on the Commission to be "fair", considering that "in order to promote growth, it must be possible to create large companies in small companies by merger-acquisition". The Social Democrats spoke of the European single market, "conceived, among other things, to allow the constitution of large industrial groups able to keep up with competition on the global market".

In his comments to the press on the Commission decision, Commissioner Monti felt, however, that the Volvo/Scania case "shows there is a series of sectors in which the single market is not complete and where the market remains national". In answer to questions on the merger of Daimler/Kaessboher bus manufacturing activities, previously authorised by the Commission, Mario Monti said he was not using double standards. "Circumstances were different. In this case there are no other possible suppliers whereas in Germany there were other sources of supply", the Commissioner made clear. Volvo had accused the Commission of partiality and felt that the case should be evaluated on the European market and not only on the Scandinavian market (see EUROPE of 9 March, p.14). Commissioner Monti felt in this case also that the circumstances are different because many road haulage companies and bus companies in Scandinavia are small and medium-sized companies which remain at a local scale.

As briefly indicated in yesterday's EUROPE, the European Commission banned the Scania/Volvo merger because it noted that the concentration would bring about market dominance:

i) for heavy trucks in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Ireland; ii) for touring coaches in Finland and the United Kingdom; iii) for inter-city coaches in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland; iv) for town buses in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Ireland. Volvo/Scania have held up to 90% of the Swedish heavy vehicle market and of the Finish and Irish urban bus market, as well as around 50% of the British coach market and Irish HGV market, states the Commission in its press release. The effect would be that "any competitor who wanted to challenge the merged entity would have to make large investments over a significant period of time to build up the necessary critical mass of installed vehicles in the relevant markets". For the Commission, the commitments
taken on 21 February and 7 March by Volvo would not be sufficient to allow competitors to gain a sustainable foothold on the Scandinavian market to compete with a group that would be the second largest worldwide in the trucks and bus sector.
The Commission felt that:

i) the commitments concerning the opening of dealer and after-sales service networks are "unlikely to have any significant effect on reducing the combined merged company's market share" and would not guarantee that the current dealers would begin to sell the products of competitive companies; ii) the commitment to encourage the
Page 15 of 62 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Swedish government to modify specific safety standards concerning the cabs of HGV only comes under the government itself; iii) the later commitments (after 21 February) were presented outside the legal time limit.

While acknowledging that the last "complex" commitments have not been studied in detail, the Commission assures in its press release that, "they would not in an obvious and clear-cut way remove all the identified competition concerns". According to information provided by Volvo, the Commission mainly called on the group to make a clear separation from its dealer activities and not to use the make Scania on the truck markets of Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland.

Volvo will keep 45.5% of Scania capital that it has already acquired and should, by 20 March, transfer the remaining shares proposed during the public offering. The Swedish manufacturer has around EUR 3.5 billion allowing it to envisage large scale operations with other makes, such as German Mann or American Navistar. Volkswagen or Fiat, on the other hand, could be interested in taking over Scania. As the Volvo and Scania merger is blocked, "Industrially, Scania may now continue developing its affairs independently", noted Scania President Leif Ostling, who regretted the uncertainty into which the group has been plunged.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Monti's  Self-Criticism
806 words
16 March 2000
The Wall Street Journal Europe
WSJE

As European single-market commissioner, Mario Monti spent most of his time pushing for tax "harmonization." In other words, an  EU-wide tax cartel. It's looking more and more as if his tenure as competition commissioner will be remembered for a similar crusade. Tuesday's decision to block the proposed marriage of  Volvo and Scania
was ostensibly about protecting truck consumers in Scandinavia. But it sounded more like an attempt to blackmail member states into handing over more tax and regulatory powers to  EU institutions.
How else are we supposed to interpret the reasons Mr. Monti gave for blocking the Volvo-Scania deal? On the
one hand, he says he thinks mergers and other forms of industry consolidation can actually prove beneficial to the
consumer. On the other hand, he says much of that won't happen until EU members change the treaties to give
more power to Brussels: "The more decision-making instruments for European integration, the more companies
will be able to take on a large size." And in Eurospeak: "The best way out of this dilemma is deepening the single
market."

Now most of us, including presumably the governments who signed the 1986 Single European Act and subsequent EU treaties, were under the impression that a functioning single market already exists in Europe. If it doesn't, maybe the European Parliament should ask the European Commission's competition directorate what it has been doing all these years. Rules guaranteeing the free movement of goods, labor and capital are in place. Volvo-Scania would have had only 31% market share in the EU, and the world's largest truck maker is DaimlerChrysler, a German-based company that would enjoy all the advantages of the single market in a bid to compete for some of Volvo-Scania's dominant position in the Scandinavian market. Volvo even agreed to open its dealerships to trucks from competitors and put a voluntary ceiling on its market share in Scandinavia.

But that wasn't enough for Mr. Monti. For one thing, he said, Swedish national safety standards could prove a difficult barrier to trade -- unlikely considering that differing auto emissions standards don't seem to have a detrimental impact on America's "single market." Mr. Monti also said an incredible 25% of Swedish truck owners can't afford to shop in other EU countries. Where, we wonder, did he get that figure? Are we really supposed to believe that in the Internet age it's so difficult for people to shop around, that a few hundred euros worth of travel costs are going to deter comparison shopping among people contemplating buying something as expensive as a truck, or that other manufacturers wouldn't see Volvo's abuse of a dominant position as an opportunity to set up their own dealerships in the Nordic countries?

Volvo CEO Lief Johansson was right to observe that Mr. Monti's decision appeared to "go against the basic concept of the common market." His complaint was echoed by Marc Greven of the European Automobile Association: "The commission keeps telling the industry that we have a single market. Now, in a case like this, they actually seem to be telling us we don't have a single market, just national markets."

But if this is all difficult to understand in economic terms, it's a lot more clear when viewed in light of the political motives of those who want to centralize more tax and regulatory power in the EU. Americans, for example, have over a century of experience seeing the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution used to override all manner of rights once reserved to the states. In the EU, the Trojan Horse of trade -- the supposed need to strengthen the single market -- is now being employed in a similar fashion. But, as Dominic Hobson writes nearby, a single market need not be a uniform market. The multitude of differing state practices that remain in the U.S. have not proved a barrier to a healthy economy. Quite to the contrary, they keep state governments honest.

European institutions certainly do have a role to play in policing Europe's single market, from ensuring free movement of goods and services to preventing illegal state subsidies to industry. But it would be a shame for Europe to squander its constitutional opportunity to organize itself as a genuinely competitive federal structure. If

Europe's member states want to go down the centralist road, that's one thing. It's quite another for an official whose job it is enforce the current EU treaties to even appear to threaten obstruction in order to change those treaties. Mr. Monti has some answering to do for Tuesday's remarks. The European Parliament might consider calling him in to explain.

EU chief applies brakes on mergers.
By Michael Mann.

16 March 2000
The Times of India
TOI
English
(c) 2000 The Times of India Group
STRASBOURG: The  European Union's antitrust chief on Tuesday showed the world he means business, taking the unprecedented step of blocking two high-profile mergers on the same day.

The European Commission backed EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti's proposals to stop Swedish truckmaker Volvo buying its rival Scania, and blocked half of a proposed three-way merger in the aluminium industry.
While Monti gave the go-ahead to Canadian firm Alcan's buy of Switzerland's Alusuisse, he prevented France's
Pechiney from joining the deal, fearing the merged company would dominate certain markets.

Likewise, Monti judged that Volvo and Scania would together have a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region if they were allowed to get together. His tough line raised eyebrows because it was the third merger Monti has blocked since taking the job in September last year.

Before that, the Commission had blocked just 10 mergers since 1990, and had dealt with just 11 cases where companies had chosen to withdraw their merger notifications before the Commission had completed its investigations. It is more usual for the Commission to set conditions, such as asset sales, before clearing problematic corporate alliances. But Monti played down the significance of the events.
"We're simply showing a determined willingness to do our job. We have to judge whether or not a merger creates
a dominant position on a particular market," he told reporters. "We are convinced that competition policy has to be
conducted in a very rigorous manner. We must take these decisions for the benefit of consumers but without
making life too hard for our companies."

Monti admitted, however, that he was looking to "apply a more economic approach" to the vetting of mergers. The number of mergers notified to the Commission for its appraisal has spiralled in recent months.

Monti said his officials were working on two separate papers he hoped would give companies more guidance when considering what undertakings they should make to gain the Commission's green light for a merger. He wants to set out more clearly how to define which markets to examine in considering the impact of a merger, and to give companies guidance on how and when to offer concessions to address competition concerns.

"This won't mean a blueprint, but at least they'll get to know in advance what the general view is on potential remedies," Monti said. (Reuters).

EU panel rejects Volvo bid to merge with Scania

STOCKHOLM, Sweden-- The European Commission has rejected  Volvo's planned $6.9 billion merger with rival
Swedish truck and bus maker Scania as anticompetitive.

The commission, which is the executive arm of the 15-member  European Union, said the merger "would have caused serious competition concerns by creating dominant positions" in several sectors, including the heavy truck and bus markets in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Ireland.

The commission ruled that a combined market share, which it estimated would range from 50 percent to 90 percent, would raise barriers to entry or expansion in those markets.

"The merger would therefore significantly change the market structure to the detriment of the customers," the commission's decision said.

The proposed merger, announced in August, would have created the world's second-largest truck and bus maker, behind DaimlerChrysler.

Volvo, which is based in Goteborg, had lobbied hard for approval, offering to open its extensive truck retail and service network to competition and to reduce its market share. But the commission rejected the concessions.

Volvo's chief executive, Leif Johansson, expressed regret over the decision, saying it seemed "to go against the basic concept of the common market."

Volvo currently holds 45.5 percent of Scania and will retain its stake for now, according to a statement issued before the commission made its decision public.
"We will now follow the continuing developments, but in the short term we foresee no need to divest our shares in
Scania," Johansson said.
The two companies will pursue other forms of cooperation, Volvo said. Document dn00000020010820dw3h002sk

INTERVIEW-More truck mergers certain - Volvo CEO.

GHENT, Belgium, March 17 (Reuters) -  Volvo chief Leif Johansson said on Friday he still wanted to play a part in consolidation in the truck industry despite this week's  EU veto of a merger with rival  Scania .

"(The decision) means we will need to find new solutions, not for the Swedish market, that was never our intention, but to become globally competitive," Johansson,  Volvo's president and chief executive officer, told Reuters.

"I feel that in this industry, to be really competitive over a three-to five-year period with all the investments necessary, driven by environmental reasons and a new generation of products, there will need to be consolidation, at least in Europe but probably on a global scale.
"Our position is that we would like to be part of that and if possible drive it," he said.

Johansson was in Ghent, where Volvo has a large part of its production, to address a conference on economic and monetary union (EMU) which, he said, would inevitably lead to fewer large European firms but ones which were more globally competitive.

He declined to comment on who Volvo might turn to after its planned marriage with Scania was annulled on competition grounds by the European Commission on Tuesday.
VOLVO, SCANIA TO MULL OPTIONS

The aborted deal leaves Volvo with 45 percent of Scania's capital and 32 percent of its voting rights. Johansson said the two were talking about how they could now cooperate in pre-competitive areas, such as research and development.

"The two companies have decided jointly that we will examine what the different options are. One of the options we will examine is to work together in pre-competitive phases, areas like basic combustion technologies and there may be areas of non-strategic components," Johansson said.
He said there were no "self-imposed deadlines" on the discussions.

"Nor (are their deadlines) for alliances or acquisitions. Deals like these don't come together overnight...They are dependent on market situation but also on how you can make things come through," he said.

MERGER OFF THE BOOKS, FOR NOW.

The planned merger between Swedish truck giants  Volvo and Scania is off after a ruling by the  European Union
(EU) Commission this week.

In a decision that surprised and dismayed both companies, the commission expressed concerns over the potential for a monopoly. The merger between the two Swedish truck-makers - which was largely seen as a protectionist measure for Sweden Incorporated - would have ranked the group the second-largest truck manufacturer behind the DaimlerChrysler empire.
Volvo Truck chief executive officer Leif Johansson was philosophical about the decision.
He said Volvo must look ahead and move onward to strengthen its global competitiveness.
He said in a statement that Volvo must evaluate other options in relation to the commission's decision.

Volvo's current 45.5 per cent holding in Scania is not affected by the ruling and, says Johansson, Volvo does not intend to sell any or all of its stake in Scania.

Scania's chief executive officer, Leif Ostling, also regretted the decision, saying the time taken for the commission to reach a conclusion had placed strain on the company and its sales organisation.

"Industrially, Scania now continues to develop its business as an independent actor, irrespective of the current ownership structure," he said.

Judging by Volvo's reference to evaluating other options and Scania's closing comment that "for the time being, Scania has no further comments to the situation", and given the vast scale of any merger between the two
truck-makers, it would be fair to say this issue is far from dead.

WOLFSBURG, Germany, March 23 (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG's Chairman Ferdinand Piech said on Thursday it would make sense for VW to own several commercial vehicles brands amid speculation it wants to buy Swedish truck maker Scania .

Europe's biggest car maker, which remains committed to expanding into the truck market through an acquisition or under its own steam, had been widely tipped to launch a bid for  Scania before the Scaninavian group agreed to an alliance with  Volvo last year.

But a Volvo and Scania merger was scuppered by the European Commission earlier this year raising the prospect of other auto companies renewing their interest in both truck makers.

"We are doing well with our own (commercial vehicles) development but it would be beneficial for us to get a brand which we don't already own ourselves," Piech said at the Wolfsburg-based car maker's annual earnings news conference.
VW makes cars, transporters and vans but does not manufacture heavy or medium-sized trucks. ((Frankfurt

MAN says interested in buying  rival truck maker.

MUNICH, March 24 (Reuters) - German truck and machinery maker MAN AG said on Friday it saw no danger of it being taken over and that it was still interested in acquiring a rival truck maker.

MAN has been tipped as a possible bidder for a rival but has also been seen as vunerable to a takeover by Swedish truck maker AB  Volvo after Volvo's planned merger with  Scania was blocked by the European Commission earlier this year.

The Munich-based company said it would consider a capital increase and an initial public offering of shares in its truck division MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG to fund a major deal.

Although it was interested in an acquisition of another European truck maker or a merger with a rival it was "not in any hot merger talks", MAN's Chief Financial Officer Ferdinand Graf von Ballestrem said.

MAN had major financial resources at its disposal to fund any expansion, he said. "MAN has three resources at its disposal: MAN shares, MAN Nutzfahrzeuge shares and a capital increase," he said.

The company would consider acquiring virtually any European rival except DaimlerChrysler, Graf von Ballestrem said.
MAN has expressed interest in the past in an alliance with both France's Renault Vehicules Industriels and Fiat's
Iveco truck unit.
But its insistence on a dominant position in any alliance appears to have ruled out the prospect of a deal.

Volkswagen,  Europe's biggest car maker, insisted yesterday that it was not interested in acquiring rival German group BMW and that it had no plans to acquire permanent rights to Rolls-Royce. However, the group did not rule out a bid for  Scania following the  EC's decision to block the bid from fellow Swedish truck maker  Volvo.
Yesterday VW revealed that profits last year fell by 26% to DM1.651bn ( #518m), but predicted that results for the current year would be `in the double-digit per cent range'.
Vodafone set to clear  EU hurdle

Vodafone yesterday appeared optimistic that it will win EU clearance for its takeover of German mobile phones group Mannesmann by the middle of next month. Brussels officials said the UK group had submitted `fresh remedies' to win approval, delaying the deadline for a decision of the one-month investigation - known as phase one - until April 11 or 12. Vodafone sources indicated that the group had given new assurances that its takeover of Mannesmann would not produce an over-dominant force in European telephony or unfairly damage the interests of big players such as Deutsche Telekom. They believe these are enough to avoid the inquiry by the EU's competition authorities entering a second phase - which would take up to six months.
Abbey tuned in to Telewest

Abbey National's partnership with cable company Telewest bears fruit on Monday when its television banking service goes live. Abbey already has TV banking on Open and will launch a service on NTL digital cable TV this year.
NHS drugs supply study

The government and the pharmaceutical industry yesterday agreed to a joint study of competition in the supply of drugs to the health service - a move that drug firms hope will lead to less regulation. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said the study would look at sales of branded drugs to the NHS, estimated to be worth about #6bn a year. The association says controls should be relaxed, given increased competition.
BP takes China stake

BP Amoco yesterday announced a gas marketing joint venture with China's largest oil and gas company, PetroChina. BP will also take a 20% stake in shares being offered as part of PetroChina's flotation, up to $1bn.

VW Seen Fully Taking Over Scania, But No Great Rush

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Volkswagen AG (G.VOW) is expected to try to buy all of Sweden's  Scania AB (SCVA) in the long run, though for now the group may sit on the effective controlling stake it acquired Monday from Investor AB (S.INV).

The German automotive group is seen to have taken the driver's seat at  Scania, with the truck maker's largest shareholder, Volvo AB (VOLVY), neutralized by a recent  European Union Commission competition ruling. Analysts see few challenges to VW's position, and expect that it will eventually buy  Volvo's stake.

"Eventually they (VW) will want to take over all of Scania, but in the short term, there seems to be no indication of any bid and the current situation could possibly last for years," said Anders Trapp, analyst with Enskilda securities in Stockholm.

Under the deal, VW will pay Investor AB SEK13.84 billion for 34% of the Scania voting rights and 18.7% of its shares.

The ownership of Volvo and Scania had been open to speculation since the E.U. Commission blocked a planned merger between the two on March 14.
Volvo, which holds 45.5% of Scania, has been barred by the Commission from a board seat or actively managing
Scania.

Analysts said they view Monday's step as an "entry ticket" into Scania by VW in order to ensure that the Swedish truck maker doesn't fall into the hands of a rival.
"Volkswagen has probably felt the need to move quickly after the merger with Volvo was broken up," said Mats
Liss, analyst with FoereningsSparbanken in Stockholm.

Investor AB President and Chief Executive Marcus Wallenberg said it was important to address uncertainties stemming from the Commission's decision.

"When that decision came from Brussels, it was important to find the best long-term solution for Scania and our shareholders," Wallenberg said. "I believe that Volkswagen will be a very good industrial main owner for Scania." Investor will hold onto 15.3% of the votes and 18.7% of the capital in Scania for at least two years.

Volvo is under no obligation to dispose of its stake, and spokesman Mats Edenborg said Volvo hasn't yet taken a definite stand on selling the stake.
Most market watchers believe Volvo would be willing to part with it at the right price.

VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech said no talks have yet taken place with Volvo, but that he would not be overly concerned if Volvo holds onto its Scania stake for some time.
"I wouldn't mind if they (Volvo) stayed," Piech said at a news conference in Stockholm.

Analysts said they reckon Volvo's Scania stake is likely to end up in VW's hands. "The liquidity of that asset has been reduced drastically by this since it's difficult to seen any other players challenging VW over Scania," said Liss.

VW paid a relatively high price for the Scania stake, at SEK370 per class A share. In Stockholm, Scania A shares traded at SEK257 by 1440 GMT, unchanged from Friday. Meanwhile the class B shares fell 1.9%, or SEK5, to
258. Each A share carries one vote while the B shares have one tenth of a vote each.

Liss said Scania's share price may drift over the medium term as its ownership is now deadlocked between two big owners.
Investor was the big winner on the deal, market participants said, pushing the share 4.6%, or SEK6 higher to
SEK135.50.

Because of the high price it paid for the shares bought Monday, VW is likely to bide its time before going for the rest. Analysts also said they believe Volvo will have to accept a lower price than Investor for its shares, because they are not such a marketable asset.

There are no obvious synergies from integrating Scania into VW since the German group has no heavy truck operations and this also speaks for VW resting on the trigger for now.

Swedish bourse regulation also stipulates that when a shareholder acquires more than 40% of the votes in a company, it has to make an offer to buyout the remaining shareholders.

STOCKHOLM, March 27 (Reuters) -  Europe's largest carmaker Volkswagen AG will take a major stake in Swedish truckmaker  Scania AB in a further consolidation of the  European vehicle industry,  Scania shareholder Investor AB said on Monday.
The takeover had been widely predicted after the  European Union rejected a merger between  Scania and
Swedish rival AB  Volvo on March 14.
Volkswagen will acquire 34.0 percent of the votes and 9.1 percent of the capital of Scania for 13.84 billion
Swedish crowns ($1.6 billion).

UPDATE 4-Volkswagen buys into Scania trucks  at a premium.
By Tony Austin

Reuters News

English

STOCKHOLM, March 27 (Reuters) -  Europe's biggest carmaker Volkswagen achieved a long-standing ambition to move into heavy trucks on Monday by acquiring a strategic stake in Sweden's  Scania AB.
VW's move had been widely anticipated after the  European Union vetoed a merger between  Scania and
Swedish rival AB  Volvo on March 14 on competition grounds.
"This generally fulfils VW's desire to get into the heavy truck business," said Nicolas Hirth, auto analyst at Morgan
Stanley.
Volkswagen will acquire 34.0 percent of the votes and 18.7 percent of the capital of Scania for 13.84 billion
Swedish crowns ($1.60 billion), by purchasing 37.4 million of its less actively traded "A" shares.
It is buying the shares from Investor AB, the investment vehicle for Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family.

"The deal makes sense for VW," MM Warburg analyst Peter Seppelfricke said, noting that its Scania stake was delivering VW a slice of Europe's second-largest truck operation after German rival DaimlerChrysler's.
"But they're paying a high price to get into the trucks business," he stressed.

"They have reached one of their goals," Swedbank analyst Mats Liss agreed, adding that he did not see any immediate synergies from the deal, hence the high premium.

Volkswagen paid 370 Swedish crowns per "A" share in Scania, figures by Investor showed on Monday. The "A" shares are not widely traded but carry one vote per share in the company.
The "A" shares closed 2.5 crowns down in a weaker Stockholm market, at 255, off an earlier 266 high. Scania's more widely traded "B" shares, which carry only one tenth of a vote each, ended six crowns lower at
257, after VW said it was not bidding for the remaining Scania shares. VW rose 0.9 euros to 45.60 while Volvo's
share was down 7.5 crowns at 219. Investor's B-share rose six crowns to 136.
VW HAS NOT TALKED TO VOLVO

Ferdinand Piech, Chief Executive of VW, which had been talking to Scania before rival Volvo built up a controlling stake last year, expressed satisfaction with the deal.

"Volkswagen has made a strategic decision to expand in the area of heavy commercial vehicles, in line with our long-term strategy. Scania is the world's leading brand when it comes to trucks," he said.

Piech said VW had no objection if Volvo retained its large minority stake in Scania. "We have not talked to Volvo about their Scania shares. We have not talked to them at all," he told a news conference in Stockholm.

Swedbank's Mats Liss said it would be a reasonable strategy for VW to increase its stake, but Piech appeared in no hurry.
"They would have to bid for the whole company and that would be very expensive," he said.

Metzler private bank analyst Juergen Pieper agreed the deal was good for Volkswagen, but warned that Volvo's continued stake in Scania and the continued influence of Investor would limit the German group's influence.
Page 34 of 62 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Scania President and Chief Executive Leif Ostling, who had opposed the Volvo tie-up, said in a statement: "In the present situation, it is a considerable advantage for Scania to get a new, stable industrial owner such as Volkswagen.
"We have common fundamental values and we have known each other for a long time," he added, referring to
Svenska Volkswagen, a sales and distribution joint venture in Sweden.

"We will reopen the old cooperation programme with Volkswagen. Partly on the motor side, partly in basic research. We will besides always share each other's know-how," he said.
But he did not rule out future resumption of cooperation with Volvo, especially in components.
Ostling also said that Volvo, despite its large stake, would not have a seat on the Scania board as a result of the
EU ruling "because you cannot have insight into a competitor".
Volvo owns 45.6 percent of Scania's share capital, with 30.7 percent of the votes.
Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg told Reuters it was too soon to say what Volvo would do with its Scania shares. "Volkswagen as a future owner of Scania is a good solution under the current circumstances," he said.
Per Spangberg, responsible for Investor's investor relations, said the company had made a profit of 7.1 billion crowns on the Scania-Volkswagen deal.
Investor agreed to remain a shareholder of Scania for at least two years. It now has 15.3 percent of the votes and
9.1 percent of the capital.

VW Will Buy An 18.7% Stake In Scania Trucks

STOCKHOLM -- Volkswagen may end up with  Scania trucks in its garage after all.

Fourteen months after AB  Volvo butted in on the mating dance between Volkswagen AG and  Scania AB and two weeks after the  European Union called off a  Volvo-Scania marriage, VW announced it would buy an 18.7%
stake and 34% of the votes in the Swedish truck maker for 13.84 billion Swedish kronor ($1.62 billion).

"This is not a takeover," says Ferdinand Piech, chief executive officer of VW. "We want to keep the creative culture of Scania alive. It's dangerous if an owner gives too much direction."

Still, the move is viewed by some auto-industry observers as a prelude to an eventual takeover of Scania by the big German car maker. Now that Volvo can no longer tie the knot with Scania, the company will have to sell its
45.5% stake in Scania to an appropriate buyer, likely VW, or else float the shares on the stock market. Insiders at
Volvo say they are ready to sell to VW if the price is right. But Mr. Piech does not seem interested for the
moment, as he chose not to purchase an additional 9% stake from holding company Investor AB.

The part of that stake made up of voting shares would have lifted VW's voting rights to over 40%, in essence giving it control of the company and forcing it to make a bid for the whole of Scania according to Swedish law. That makes analysts wonder what will happen.
"I don't see how VW can exercise any control over Scania," said Lars Soederfjell, an analyst with Den Danske
Bank in Stockholm. "VW doesn't control the cash flow. It's just another alliance."
Investor will maintain a 9.1% stake and 15.3% of the votes for the next two years. Scania will remain listed. VW paid 370 kronor per Scania A share. Scania A shares, which carry one vote each, fell 2.50 kronor to 255
kronor on Monday, down from a midday high of 266 kronor. Scania B shares, which carry only one tenth of a vote
each, shed six kronor Monday to 257 kronor, while VW shares were at 45.10 euros ($44.08), a gain of 60
European cents. Volvo dropped 7.50 kronor to 218.50 kronor.

Scania's ownership situation has been uncertain for more than a year. In January of last year, briefly before Volvo sold its car operation to Ford Motor Co., Volvo bought a surprise 13% stake in its Swedish rival and announced its plans to merge the two heavy truck makers, much to the dismay of Investor, which at the time was in takeover talks with VW. The EU vetoed the deal on March 14, arguing the company would have too much control over the Swedish market.

VW's Mr. Piech indicated he is not interested in purchasing all of Scania for the moment. Instead, he wishes to continue "be a guest" to the Swedish truck maker. As for VW's relationship with Volvo, Mr. Piech was unclear. Whereas he said he doesn't mind Volvo's presence in Scania, he predicted that "there will be solution this year." When pressed on what kind of solution, he hinted that Volvo and VW could perhaps find common interests regarding Volvo Penta, the Swedish company's marine-engine division. "We'll see about that," Mr. Piech said, adding, "We'll work something out." He declined to elaborate and Volvo wouldn't comment.

At Scania, VW's move was widely cheered. Scania insiders have always deemed VW as the ideal partner for the truck maker. And the current ownership construction will keep the company independently listed at least for now. During recent months, it became increasingly uncertain whether the truck would continue under its own brand name. The EU suggested that Volvo and Scania should operate under one brand name in the Scandinavian

market in order to let the merger pass antitrust regulations. "This is not an easy solution, but it's a good one," says
Leif Oestling, Scania's chief executive officer. "We were getting afraid that there would be much left over of
Scania if this ownership uncertainty continued."

VW Acquires Minority Stake in Scania, Buying  Foothold in Heavy-Truck  Market

STOCKHOLM -- Expanding its portfolio to heavy trucks, Volkswagen AG acquired a minority stake in Swedish truck maker Scania AB from Wallenberg holding company Investor AB for 13.84 billion kronor ($1.62 billion).

The move follows the European Union's veto earlier this month of a merger between  Scania and rival heavy-truck maker AB Volvo, because the combined company would have too large a market share in Scandinavia.

The German car maker bought 18.7% of Scania's shares, giving it 34% of the voting rights. Investor will maintain a 9.1% stake in Scania, with 15.3% of the votes, for the next two years. Scania will remain listed on the Stockholm stock exchange. For the moment, Volkswagen isn't making any offer for Scania's shares outstanding. Volvo still controls roughly 45.55% of Scania shares and 30.6% of the votes, and insiders at Volvo say the company would readily agree to sell its stake at the current price if VW were to make an offer.

VW paid 370 kronor per Scania share. In Stockholm, Scania A shares were trading at 266 kronor a share at the time of the deal, while the widely traded Scania B shares, which carry only 1/10th of a vote each, were trading at
226.5 a share.

"This is not a takeover," says Ferdinand Piech, chief executive of VW. "We want to keep the creative culture of Scania alive. It's dangerous if an owner gives too much direction." He said he doesn't mind "if Volvo wants to stay on" at Scania.

However, Mr. Piech predicted that "there will be a solution this year" to the question of Volvo's stake. When pressed, he hinted that Volvo and VW could perhaps find common interests regarding Volvo Penta, the Swedish company's marine-engine division.

Scania's ownership has been in flux for more than 14 months. In January 1999, briefly before Volvo sold its car operation to Ford Motor Co., Volvo bought a 13% stake in its Swedish rival and announced its plans to forge a merger between the two heavy-truck makers. The arrangement dismayed Investor, then in takeover talks with VW, but in the end, the merger plan was vetoed by the EU on March 14.

Market analysts complain that Scania now is a dead duck on the stock market, because the company is more than 80% owned by Volvo, Investor and VW. Moreover, auto-industry analysts say VW can't really do much with its stake in Scania and predict the company will have to take over Volvo's shares eventually in order to create significant cost savings.

At Scania, VW's move was widely cheered. Scania insiders have always seen VW as the ideal partner, and the current ownership arrangement will keep the company independently listed, for now.

All eyes are now on Volvo, which is on the lookout for a merger in an ever-shrinking pool of potential partners. Moreover, the company has a large cash position, which makes it a possible takeover target itself.

Still, considerable uncertainty lingers regarding Scania's ownership. Volvo, which was not consulted in the sale of Investor's stake in Scania, said it was pleased to see VW as an owner given the current circumstances. The car maker did not indicate what it plans to do with its stake in Scania, but people inside the company say that without any operational influence at Scania, Volvo is no longer interested in maintaining its stake in the company. Volvo would sell its stake to VW, these people say, but so far VW has not made an offer at the current share price. "It's still question what we will do with our shares," says Mats Edenborg, a spokesman for Volvo. "If there is a good offer for our stake, we need to look into that, but that's not yet the case."

All eyes are now focused on Volvo, which is now on the lookout for a merger target in an ever-shrinking pool of potential partners. Moreover, the company has a large cash position, which makes it a possible takeover target itself. "Volvo should look West for a partner," says Mr. Soederfjell. "Or else Fiat could be a potential buyer."

Stockholm -- Volkswagen AG may end up with  Scania trucks in its garage after all.
Fourteen months after AB Volvo interrupted the mating dance between the German auto maker and  Scania AB
and two weeks after the European Union blocked a Volvo-Scania marriage, VW announced it would buy an
18.7-per-cent stake and 34 per cent of the votes in the Swedish truck maker for 13.84 billion Swedish kronor
($1.62-billion U.S.).

"This is not a takeover," says Ferdinand Piech, VW's chief executive officer. "We want to keep the creative culture of Scania alive. It's dangerous if an owner gives too much direction."

Still, the move is viewed by some as a prelude to VW's eventual takeover of Scania. Now that Volvo can no longer tie the knot with Scania, the company will have to sell its 45.5-per-cent stake in Scania, likely to VW, or else float the shares on the stock market. Insiders at Volvo say they are ready to sell to VW if the price is right.

Mr. Piech, however, doesn't seem interested for the moment, as he declined to purchase an additional 9 per cent Scania stake from Swedish holding company Investor AB. The part of that stake made up of voting shares would have lifted VW's voting rights to more than 40 per cent, giving it control of the company and forcing it to make a bid for the whole of Scania under Swedish law. That makes analysts wonder what will happen.
"I don't see how VW can exercise any control over Scania," said Lars Soederfjell, an analyst with Den Danske
Bank in Stockholm. "VW doesn't control the cash flow. It's just another alliance."

VW paid 370 kronor per Scania A share. Scania A shares, which carry one vote each, fell 2.50 kronor to 255 kronor in domestic trading yesterday. Scania B shares, which carry only one-tenth of a vote each, shed six kronor to 257 kronor. Volvo dropped 7.50 kronor to 218.50 kronor. In Frankfurt trading, VW shares rose to 45.10 euros ($44.08 U.S.), up 60 European cents.

Scania's ownership situation has been uncertain for more than a year. In January 1999, briefly before Volvo sold its car-making operation to Ford Motor Co., Volvo bought a surprise 13-per-cent stake in its Swedish rival and announced its plans to merge the two heavy truck makers, much to the dismay of Investor, which at the time was in takeover talks with VW. The EU vetoed the deal on March 14, arguing the company would have too much control over the Swedish market.

VW's Mr. Piech indicated he isn't interested in purchasing all of Scania for the moment. As for VW's relationship with Volvo, Mr. Piech was unclear. Whereas he said he doesn't mind Volvo's presence in Scania, he predicted that "there will be solution this year."

Volkswagen buys into Scania trucks.

STOCKHOLM:  Europe's biggest carmaker Volkswagen achieved a long-standing ambition to move into heavy trucks on Monday by acquiring a strategic stake in Sweden's  Scania AB.
VW's move had been widely anticipated after the  European Union vetoed a merger between  Scania and
Swedish rival AB  Volvo on March 14 on competition grounds.
"This generally fulfils VW's desire to get into the heavy truck business," said Nicolas Hirth, auto analyst at Morgan
Stanley.
Volkswagen will acquire 34.0 percent of the votes and 18.7 percent of the capital of Scania for 13.84 billion
Swedish crowns ($1.60 billion), by purchasing 37.4 million of its less actively traded "A" shares.
It is buying the shares from Investor AB, the investment vehicle for Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family.

"The deal makes sense for VW," MM Warburg analyst Peter Seppelfricke said, noting that its Scania stake was delivering VW a slice of Europe's second-largest truck operation after German rival DaimlerChrysler's.
"But they're paying a high price to get into the trucks business," he stressed.

"They have reached one of their goals," Swedbank analyst Mats Liss agreed, adding that he did not see any immediate synergies from the deal, hence the high premium.

volkswagen paid 370 Swedish crowns per "A" share in Scania, figures by Investor showed on Monday. The "A" shares are not widely traded but carry one vote per share in the company.
They were down half a crown at 257 in Stockholm at 1345 GMT, off an earlier 266 high.

Scania's more widely traded "B" shares, which carry only one tenth of a vote each, were trading four down at 259 crowns at 1230 GMT. VW was 0.46 euros up at 44.96 while Volvo's share was down 4.5 crowns at 222. Investor's B-share was 5.5 crowns higher at 135.5 in a firm market.

Ferdinand Piech, chief executive of VW, which had been talking to Scania before rival Volvo built up a controlling stake last year, expressed satisfaction with the deal.

"Volkswagen has made a strategic decision to expand in the area of heavy commercial vehicles, in line with our long-term strategy. Scania is the world's leading brand when it comes to trucks," he said.

Piech said VW had no objection if Volvo retained its large minority stake in Scania. "We have not talked to Volvo about their Scania shares. We have not talked to them at all," he told a news conference in Stockholm.

Swedbank's Mats Liss said it would be a reasonable strategy for VW to increase its stake, but Piech appeared in no hurry.
"They would have to bid for the whole company and that would be very expensive," he said.

Metzler private bank analyst Juergen Pieper agreed the deal was good for Volkswagen, but warned that Volvo's continued stake in Scania and the continued influence of Investor would limit the German group's influence.

Scania President and Chief Executive Leif Ostling, who had opposed the Volvo tie-up, said in a statement: "In the present situation, it is a considerable advantage for Scania to get a new, stable industrial owner such as Volkswagen.
Page 44 of 62 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"We have common fundamental values and we have known each other for a long time," he added, referring to
Svenska Volkswagen, a sales and distribution joint venture in Sweden.
Ostling also said that Volvo, despite its large stake, would not have a seat on the Scania board as a result of the
EU ruling "because you cannot have insight into a competitor".
Volvo owns 45.6 percent of Scania's share capital, with 30.7 percent of the votes.
Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg said it was too soon to say what Volvo would do with its Scania shares. "Volkswagen as a future owner of Scania is a good solution under the current circumstances," he said.
Per Spangberg, responsible for Investor's investor relations, said the company had made a profit of 7.1 billion crowns on the Scania-Volkswagen deal.
investor agreed to remain a shareholder of Scania for at least two years. It now has 15.3 percent of the votes and
9.1 percent of the capital. (Reuters).

COMPETITION - EURO-MPS LEND SUPPORT FOR BLOCK EXEMPTION REFORMS, CLAMPDOWN ON STATE AID.
843 words
29 March 2000
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2000 European Report.
The European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs approved on March 23 a draft Resolution tabled by Belgian MEP Marianne Thyssen (EPP/ED), broadly supporting the Commission's new guidelines on its reform of the existing  EU block exemption Regulations affecting distribution, purchasing and franchise agreements. Concurrently, Commissioner Mario Monti addressed the Committee on state aid and mergers, the recent controversial cases in the motor industry - BMW's plans to sell most of its interests in Rover (see European Report Number 2484) and the  EU executive's March 14 decision to block  Volvo's bid to take over its rival Scania. He also about his broader thoughts on mergers generally after now being in office six months as Competition Commissioner.
Exclusivity deals under the spotlight.

The block exemption guidelines clarify the Commission's policy towards the application of Treaty Article 81 and vertical agreements and explain the position with regard to block exemptions from EU competition rules. The new approach reflects an economic rather than a legal attitude with restrictive business agreements analysed in their market context and are no longer based on category, but simply market share, with a threshold now set at 30%. The threshold itself was always a prickly subject with some calls (from the industry lobby group, UNICE, for example) to increase it to 40%. And of course the question of exemptions was always expected to form the crux
of another debate. Although the Commission is not obliged to consult Parliament, Mrs Thyssen is nevertheless putting forward several proposals on points of detail with a view to clarifying the situation on such questions as agency agreements, to take into account risks borne by businesses. The Commission should also explain how it intends to monitor the anti-competitive effect of exclusivity clauses in exclusive agency agreements as there are no indications yet how it would check on such arrangements. The Committee said it also wants to see specific action taken against restrictive resale agreements made by suppliers to protect national markets and shut out parallel imports.
State aid: "Still too high".

On the eve of the publication of the Commission's 8th annual report on state aid for the 1996-98 period, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee that despite the annual figure falling from Euro 106 billion in the previous three-year period to Euro 93 billion, mainly as a result of the decline in aid to the German Laender and Italy, the level of assistance was "still too high if the
Single Market is to operate effectively". Confirming the Commission's new approach to get tough with the Member States on state aid, he said such assistance could only be justified in "exceptional" circumstances - but neglected to illustrate what those circumstances were. While the bulk of assistance had gone towards manufacturing and indeed had increased in the cohesion countries i.e. Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, in future he said in reply to questions, the intention was to re-orientate policy towards financing research and environmental measures. As to subsidies for the nuclear industry, these were governed by the Euratom Treaty, he said. Responding to another of Parliament's concerns to see a "Scoreboard" with a detailed breakdown to enable comparisons to be made, he was hopeful this could be produced next year.
Cars, trucks and relevant criteria.

On the question of the Commission's attitude towards mergers, Mario Monti emphasised that, in general, he saw most mergers as beneficial to the European economy and indeed that out of 255 merger notifications in 1999 only one was turned down. He recognised the concern of MEPs over the criteria used for vetting mergers and acquisitions and explained that a decision would always be taken in the context of the "relevant" market, which could be regional, national, European or global depending on the circumstances, and the perceived impact on consumer prices in the event of the creation of a dominant position. Expanding on this point in the Volvo/Scania

case, he said such a new grouping as proposed would have had control of 94% of the Swedish market and prices likely to rise by 5-10%. And he said in response to criticisms of the decision in Sweden, the Commission's move was supported by Sweden's competition authorities and would have been vetoed if Sweden had not been a member of the EU.

Taking up the BMW decision to pull out of Rover just six years after taking over the UK car maker, in response to another question, he said the Commission had not been informed in advance, adding that notification was not required in the context of the Commission's investigation into national subsidies.

The Commissioner also announced an investigation into the proposed link-up between Microsoft, the Liberty media company and the Telewest cable company. This has implications for the digital television industry and the provision of decoders in the UK.

STOCKHOLM, March 30 (AFP) -  Volvo, a Swedish manufacturer of trucks, is at an advanced stage of talks with Renault Vehicules Industriels (RVI), a subsidiary of the Renault auto group, the newspaper Dagens Industry reported on Thursday.
The newspaper, which did not identify sources, said that the talks had been "intensified" since March 15 when the
EU Commission rejected a planned merger of  Volvo and rival Swedish truck maker  Scania.

UPDATE 1-Volvo talking  to Renault about trucks-paper.

STOCKHOLM, March 30 (Reuters) - Swedish truck and busmaker AB  Volvo is in intensive negotiations about the acquisition of Renault's truck division RVI, a Swedish newspaper reported on Thursday.
Contacts have intensified since the  European Union blocked Volvo's proposed takeover of Swedish rival  Scania
on March 14, business daily Dagens Industri said.

The talks, which ironically would revive part of a Volvo-Renault merger which failed to materialise in 1993, come as consolidation in the automotive structure shifts into high gear.

Earlier this week German carmaker Volkswagen AG fulfilled a long-standing ambition to move into heavy trucks by taking a large stake in Scania after the collapse of Scania's merger with Volvo.

And German-U.S. industrial group DaimlerChrysler took a 34 percent stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp, which last year agreed to cooperate with Volvo in trucks.
Renault itself is in talks to buy troubled South Korean automaker Samsung Motors.
"Volvo and Renault had a relationship before and I don't think this deal is unlikely", said one industry source. Dagens Industri said Volvo's board would meet on Thursday to hear a report from Chief Executive Leif Johansson
about the negotiations with Renault Vehicules Industriels (RVI).

The paper, which accurately predicted the collapse of the Volvo-Scania deal, quoted a Volvo source as saying a deal could come about within the next few weeks.
A Volvo spokesman declined to comment and would not confirm whether the group's board was meeting today. Renault also declined to comment.
Volvo shares were down three crowns in early trade at 235 in a weaker Stockholm market while Renault was up
1.1 percent at 41.53 euros, off an earlier 42.30 high.
VOLVO FIGHTING TAKEOVER SPECULATION

Volvo's shares have risen since its Scania deal fell through on speculation that Volvo itself was vulnerable to a takeover.

Volvo sold its car business to Ford last year, vowing to plough the proceeds into building the group into a world leader in the truck sector.

On Wednesday Volvo CEO Leif Johansson said he did not believe Volvo was more exposed since the Scania deal fell apart.
"Is Volvo at risk? The chances have not increased or decreased in the last four years," he said.

"My role is not to sell the company but to develop it into a global company. We will do this through a high organic growth rate," he said, adding that Volvo was also open to the possibilities of acquisitions.

Last September, when reports surfaced that Volvo was eyeing RVI, Renault reiterated Chairman Louis
Schweitzer's comments that the unit was not up for sale.
In recent months, Schweitzer has confirmed that he considers RVI a key part of Renault's business.

Renault also owns U.S. truckmaker Mack Trucks Inc and together they have 24 percent of the U.S. market, according to Dagens Industri.

In 1999 Volvo's profit after financial items excluding gains from the sale of Volvo Cars was 7.9 billion crowns on sales of 125 billion crowns.
Renault's commercial vehicle division had an operating profit of 220 million euros ($210 million) in 1999.

Volvo, which sold off its car division to Ford in late 1998, would prefer to pay for RVI in cash while Schweitzer was reported to prefer payment in Volvo shares, the paper said. ($1=8.613 Swedish Crown ($1=1.048 Euro).

WOLFSBURG, Germany, April 2 (Reuters) - The supervisory board of  Europe's biggest car maker, Volkswagen, on Sunday approved the purchase of a 18.7 percent stake in Sweden's truck maker  Scania for 13.84 billion Swedish crowns ($1.6 billion).

"The supervisory board in an extraordinary meeting on April 2 authorised the executive board to buy from Investor AB a capital stake in  Scania AB of 18.7 percent (equals 34 percent of the votes) at a price of 13.838 billion SKR," the company said in a terse, one sentence statement. The plan was initially announced on March 27 and had
been widely anticipated after the  European Union vetoed a merger between  Scania and Swedish rival AB  Volvo
on competition grounds.

The deal was seen as making good on VW's long-standing ambition to move into the heavy truck business. ($1=8.655 Swedish Crown).

The supervisory board of  Europe's biggest car-maker, Volkswagen yesterday approved the purchase of a 18.7 per cent stake in Sweden's truck maker  Scania for #1 billion.

The plan was initially announced on March 27 and had been widely anticipated after the  European Union vetoed a merger between Scania and Swedish rival AB  Volvo on competition grounds.
The deal was seen as making good on VW's long-standing ambition to move into the heavy truck business. Miller set to float
Britain's biggest privately owned construction company, Miller Group, may be preparing for a #500 million flotation this year.

Industry insiders said the company, whose Midland base is in Rugby, thought the fall in technology and telecoms stock prices could improve the chances of a successful flotation of 'old economy' stocks later this year.
While profitable, the UK construction industry has been ignored by investors hungry for technology stocks. The Edinburgh-based company's chief executive, Keith Miller, will announce improved revenues and profits
today. The company is thought to have posted a profit of #20 million pounds in 1999 and has an acquisitions war
chest of up to #200 million.

CHICAGO --  Europe's biggest automaker, Volkswagen AG, last week achieved a long-standing ambition to move into the heavy-truck business by acquiring a major stake in Sweden's  Scania AB. The move by VW had been widely anticipated in the auto industry after the  European Union vetoed a merger between  Scania and Swedish rival AB  Volvo on competition grounds. The deal will allow VW to expand in the area of heavy commercial
vehicles and will provide Scania with VW's resources and purchasing power, the companies said.

Auto industry tremors  hit truck business

PARIS - The heads of  Europe's carmakers are spending a lot of their time thinking about heavy trucks these days.

Upheaval in the commercial vehicle business can be traced to the  European Commission's March 14 veto of a merger between AB  Volvo and Scania AB.
Volvo, which sold its car business to Ford in January 1999, initiated the merger a year ago when it bought nearly
46 percent of Scania equity on the stock market.
The Commission argued that the move was anti-competitive since it would have given the combined company a
90 percent market share in Scandinavia and Ireland.

It took only a few days for the big players to react. On March 27, Volkswagen AG bought 18.7 percent of Scania's capital for A1.6 billion from Swedish industrial holding Investor AB. Investor was Scania's main shareholder.

VW now has a dominant position at Scania, with 34 percent of the voting rights. Volvo has only 31 percent of the voting rights and isn't represented on the Scania board.

VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech has long been eager to buy Scania to gain a significant position in the truck business. Scania Chairman Leif Ostling supported the Volkswagen deal rather than a merger with archrival Volvo.

As the VW-Scania deal was being finalized, Swedish newspapers reported that Volvo was talking to Renault about the acquisition of its truck division, Renault VI. Both Volvo and Renault declined to comment.
But it would not the first time the two companies' truck operations have been linked. The failed full-scale
Renault-Volvo merger in 1993 had started as a plan to merge truck operations.
Following the sale of Volvo Car Corp. to Ford, Volvo decided it needed to expand its truck business.

Volvo signed an agreement with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. in October 1999 to take a 19.9 percent stake in a truck and bus spinoff operation to be created by Mitsubishi. Volvo also took a 5 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. capital. The alliance between DaimlerChrysler and Mitsubishi Motors is not expected to threaten the truck deal.

Volvo is also reported to be looking at US truck group Navistar. Furthermore, Fiat is said to be interested in strengthening its truck and bus division Iveco by forming an alliance with Volvo. German truckmaker MAN is also considered a possible partner for other European makers.
Renault Chairman Louis Schweitzer recently said Renault VI was not for sale.
But he also said he was looking for cooperation and "did not exclude a shareholding aspect." Document aneu000020010803dw4a000b8

PARIS -  Volvo AB, the world's second-biggest maker of heavy trucks, and Renault SA, France's second-biggest carmaker, declined to comment on a newspaper report that they are close to merging their truck businesses. Renault, which had rejected a full takeover of its truck business by  Volvo, has opted instead for an alliance involving share swaps by both parent companies and their truck divisions, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified executives.  Volvo has been searching for a new truck partner since its $6.9-billion takeover of Scania AB was rejected last month by  European antitrust regulators.

TAKEOVER TANGOS.

Depending on your perspective, I have some good news and I have some bad news.
According to a high-ranking  European Volvo Truck executive, the recent decision by the  European Union
Commission preventing a merger between truck makers  Volvo and Scania is final.

Nils Arthur, senior vice-president of Volvo Trucks Europe, told Big Wheels this week there was no chance of the two companies merging, now or in the future, and reports last week of Volvo and Fiat doing the trucking tango are wide of the mark.
"It is finished, we will not be revisiting that [Scania] proposal. It is time for us as a company to move on," he said. And moving on they are, it seems.
In case you've forgotten, Volvo Trucks AB is absolutely swimming in cash after the sale last year of its car division to the Ford Motor Co. The only trouble it is having is finding somewhere to spend it.

Some of it has been used to secure 5.5 per cent of Japanese truck-maker Mitsubishi, which was restructured this month into a new company called Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Co (MFTBC).
Ultimately, Volvo will secure around 19 per cent of MFTBC in a deal between the Swedes and the Japanese. Both can be confident the reorganisation will repel any predators such as the world's number one truck
manufacturer, DaimlerChrysler, which just weeks ago took a controlling stake in Mitsubishi's car division.

That deal momentarily stalled while it was pointed out to DaimlerChrysler the truck operation was a no-go zone and that Volvo had dibs on Mitsubishi's commercial vehicle business.
After a brief tantrum, the Germans capitulated and proceeded with the passenger car transaction. Now flick the channel to truck and car manufacturer Renault V.I., maker of Mack and Renault trucks.
For more than a year it has been trying to gain control of the financially troubled Nissan Motor Co, maker of Nissan UD trucks. But it has been frustrated by the Japanese banks, which are holding the bulk of a 3 billion dollar debt created by years of mismanagement and are steadfastly refusing to accept any degree of financial loss.

It appears the famous French sense of humour is rapidly disappearing and while Renault is growing impatient with the stubborn Japanese bankers it is prepared to wait a little longer in the hope of achieving its goal. But Renault bosses are getting itchy feet.

Enter Volvo Trucks. Depending on whom you want to believe, Volvo either made an offer for Renault V.I. or Renault made a pitch for Volvo Trucks. Either way a takeover came to nought - mainly because the French government owns a chunk of Renault V.I. and national pride would never let it sell to foreigners and Volvo wouldn't want to blow its entire dowry on Renault V.I.

According to sources in Europe it did, however, create a window of opportunity for the two manufacturers to discuss business opportunities.

After all, both companies want a gilt-edged entree into the lucrative Asian market. Volvo has the advantage here, which probably makes Renault think that getting into bed with the Swedes isn't such a bad idea, just in case the Nissan deal does go pear-shaped.
Predictably, neither company is talking and Nils Arthur would not comment on the accuracy of those reports. The usually talkative executive trotted out the usual statement that "we do not publicly discuss future plans"
which, tradition shows, suggests something is brewing between the two manufacturers.
