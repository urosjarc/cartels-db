EU To Block Ryanair's  Bid For Aer Lingus  - Reuters

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission is expected to block  Ryanair Holdings PLC's (RYA.DB) takeover of rival Irish airline Aer Lingus  Group PLC (EIL1.DB), according to people familiar with the matter, reports news agency Reuters Wednesday.

In early May Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said that he believed the  European Commission would block the attempted merger with Aer Lingus  and that he would challenge such a decision in the  European Court of Justice.

His statement came after the commission delayed its antitrust review to July 4 from June 13, saying the delay is to study "commitments" offered by Ryanair to avoid antitrust problems.

Ryanair is bidding EUR1.4 billion for the carrier, but is facing strong resistance from the Irish government, which has a 25% stake in the carrier.

EXCLUSIVE-UPDATE 2-EU to bar Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus-sources

(Adds Ryanair declining comment, share reaction)

BRUSSELS, May 30 (Reuters) - The European Commission, in a rare move, is expected to reject  Ryanair's proposed purchase  of rival Irish airline Aer Lingus,  sources familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.

The prohibition of Ryanair's unsolicited offer, originally valued at 1.48 billion euros ($2 billion), will be only the 20th in more than 3,000 cases reviewed by the European Union's executive arm since 1990, and the first since 2004.

The competition department prepared a proposed decision to present to the full Commission before a July 4 deadline, after a market test found Ryanair's latest proposed remedies for competition problems were insufficient.

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has said he would challenge the Commission in court if the deal were turned down. The decision runs to more than 300 pages in an effort to deal with issues that may end up in court, one of the sources said.

Commission competition spokesman Jonathan Todd declined comment on the investigation until a final decision is taken.
A spokesman for Ryanair said: "We have a policy of not commenting on this process."

The EU regulator said in a confidential charge sheet known as a statement of objections in March it was concerned about the deal's impact on competition, especially at the Dublin airport.

It noted Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, and Ryanair, an insurgent no-frills airline, were head-to-head rivals and the number of routes on which they competed had risen to 37 from eight in the past six years, driving prices down
5 to 8 percent.

Ryanair, whose bid lapsed automatically when the Commission launched an in-depth investigation of the deal in December, said in a confidential offer it would make space for a new rival to base as many as six planes at Dublin airport.

Ryanair also offered to sell Aer Lingus' slots at London's Heathrow and Dublin for flights between the two airports. The Commission considered that would not solve the problem.
SHARES FALL

Shares in Ryanair, which had been down 0.6 percent ahead of the news, extended their losses to trade as much as 3 percent lower at 5.17 euros. They were down 2.1 percent at 5.22 euros by 1459 GMT versus a 0.8 percent dip in the Irish market.

"The EU move was anticipated and everybody knew it was coming but for those who needed the confirmation this may very well have encouraged them to sell," said a Dublin-based trader.

It also looked to have been the trigger for some people to sell down the stock ahead of Ryanair's full-year results next Tuesday, he added.

The prohibition would be only the second of Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes' tenure, though two other deals were withdrawn in the face of certain rejection.

Page 6 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Even if the Commission had approved the Ryanair deal there would have been problems because the Irish government, which holds 25 percent of Aer Lingus, opposed the transaction. So did several other stockholders.
Ryanair's O'Leary has been commenting on the proposed deal throughout the bidding process.

At one point he said the company would consider a second bid for Aer Lingus if Ryanair received a favourable outcome from the EU review and the Irish takeover panel. But he had also said he expected the deal to be blocked. Once the deal is blocked, the European Commission may not be finished with Ryanair.

It has laid the legal groundwork to force Ryanair to sell some or all of its one-quarter holding in Aer Lingus. O'Leary has said he intends to keep the 25 percent.

BRUSSELS, May 30 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is expected to reject  Ryanair's proposed takeover
of Aer Lingus  , sources familiar with the situation said.
Following is a chronology of the  takeover bid:
2006:
Oct. 2: Aer Lingus shares begin open trading as Irish government cuts its holding to 25 percent from 85 percent. Oct. 5: Ryanair acquires a 16 percent stake in Aer Lingus and makes an offer worth 1.48 billion euros ($2 billion)
to acquire the company, setting an expiry deadline of Nov. 13. Irish government reacts negatively.
Oct. 30: Ryanair asks the European Commission for competition clearance to buy Aer Lingus. Nov. 14: Ryanair extends takeover period to Dec. 4.
Nov. 28: Ryanair increases its share of Aer Lingus to 25.2 percent, but two days later Chief Financial Officer
Howard Miller calls the proposed deal "a long shot".
Dec. 6: Ryanair moves takeover deadline to Dec. 22.
Dec. 20: Commission opens in-depth investigation of deal with deadline of May 11; bid automatically lapses.
2007
Feb. 22: European Commission extends deadline to June 13.

March 29: Commission sends formal and confidential "statement of objections" to Ryanair, saying it is concerned the proposed deal would damage competition.

April 12: Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary says he expects the Commission to block the deal and if so will open a court challenge.
May 4: Commission extends deadline to July 4 as Ryanair offers new remedies to competition problems. May 9: O'Leary says if the Commission approves the deal, Ryanair will consider a second bid.

ISEQ down as Ryanair slump continues
542 words
30 May 2007
Business and Finance Daily News Service
BNFD

Copyright (c) 2007, Media World Ltd
Shares in Ryanair slumped by over 2pc today amid speculation that the  European Commission is set to reject its
bid for rival airline Aer Lingus.
The Commission's competition department is reported to have prepared a proposed decision to present to the full
Commission before a July 4 deadline.

Ryanair made an E1.48 billion bid to buy the former state airline back in October, just days after it floated on the Irish Stock Exchange. Shares in Ryanair, which owns a 25pc stake in Aer Lingus, fell 15c to 5.19 on the news. Aer Lingus ended the session flat on 2.94.

The overall ISEQ index of Irish also closed sharply lower, down 71.77 points to 9,848.05. The falls came on the back of a 6pc plunge in China's stock market and a slow start on Wall Street. Leading Chinese shares plummeted after the government confirmed plans to triple the stamp duty on stock trading. Meanwhile, U.S. investors held back ahead of the release of minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting. Market watchers were hoping that the Fed minutes would indicate that policy makers were beginning to lean towards a rate cut by the end of the year. Financial shares were some of the worst hit in Dublin with AIB down 16c to 22.51, Anglo Irish Bank down 5c to 17.44 and Irish Life and Permanent down 26c to 20.74. Bank of Ireland closed 13c lower at 16.47 ahead of the release of its full year results tomorrow. CRH led the fallers in the construction sector after its shares were downgraded to neutral versus buy by UBS. Grafton slipped 11c to 11.92, while fell 25c to 21.93 and McInerney closed unchanged on 2.66. Other notable movers included bookmaker Paddy Power, down 10c to 22.21, food group IAWS, down 14c to 18.27, and insurance group FBD Holdings, up 45c to 38.75. Dairy group Donegal Creameries added on 5c to 6.95, concrete maker Readymix tacked on 1c to 2.73 and media group UTV jumped
12c to 6.27. Shares in Glencar Mining made modest progress, jumping 5c to 0.17. The exploration company this week reported pre-tax losses of E1.4m for last year, compared with a loss of E700,000 a year earlier. Elsewhere, drug maker Elan fell 10c to 14.01 on profit taking after the company said on Tuesday that two U.S. Food and
Drug Administration advisory committees will review its Tysabri multiple sclerosis drug for use in the treatment of Crohn's disease. The review will take place at a meeting on July 31. Meanwhile, Trinity Biotech's recent strong run continued, climbing 6c to 2.01. The diagnostics firm this week entered into an agreement with the Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI). Trinity Biotech, along with CHAI's Procurement Consortium members, will offer its Unigold and Capillus rapid HIV test kits to UNITAID-eligible countries at discounted prices, Goodbody analyst, Ian Hunter, said. The agreement might result going forward in significant growth in the volumes of the
test kits supplied by the company's Irish facilities to developing countries, he added.

LONDON (Dow Jones)-- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY) faces a tough time in getting  European Union approval for its proposed takeover of rival Irish carrier  Aer Lingus  Group PLC (EIL1.DB), Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar said on Thursday.

"I think it's a very difficult situation," he said, adding that  European antitrust regulators had issued a "very negative" statement of objections to the  deal. Regulators are particularly concerned over the combined market share the two airlines would have at Dublin airport if they  merged.

Ryanair has submitted remedies to Brussels to address these concerns and, according to Millar, options include the leasing out of Aer Lingus' runway slots at London's Heathrow airport. Ryanair and Aer Lingus both compete for traffic between Dublin and London, albeit to different airports near the U.K. capital.

The E.U. Commission has opened an in-depth inquiry into the proposed takeover. Millar was speaking at a news conference in London where Ryanair unveiled a new Boeing Co. (BA) aircraft order.

EU to reject Ryanair's  proposed Aer Lingusbid.
Ciarán Hancock, Business Affairs Correspondent

Irish Times
IRTI

The European Commission is set to reject  Ryanair's proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus,  a move that could prompt Michael O'Leary to take a legal challenge to the decision.
A final recommendation might now be given to  EU commissioners at their meetings on either June 20th or June
27th, according to informed sources.
A deadline of July 4th had been set for a decision to be presented to the full commission.

It is understood the competition department of the European Commission has conducted detailed "market tests" and found Ryanair's proposed "remedies" would be insufficient to allow a takeover. It is believed to have questioned whether a new entrant would enter the market in Dublin airport if Ryanair acquired Aer Lingus.
The two airlines currently operate the majority of traffic through Dublin.

It is understood the competition department's draft prohibition decision has been circulated to the 27 EU member states for consideration by their national competition bodies.

The mergers division of the Competition Authority in Ireland is thought to be weighing up the draft decision before making any observations to Brussels.

It is not clear if Ryanair will be given another opportunity to offer "remedies" to the competition department's draft decision.

Ryanair has already made three submissions to the commission, offering a variety of concessions in the hope of getting the green light for its unsolicited, proposed takeover, which was originally valued at €1.48 billion.

A decision by the commission to prohibit a takeover is rare. It has happened just 20 times in more than 3,000 cases reviewed by the European Union's executive arm since 1990.

The decision runs to more than 300 pages in an effort to deal with issues that may end up in court, according to sources.
The commission's competition spokesman Jonathan Todd declined to comment on the investigation.
A spokesman for Ryanair said the airline was maintaining its policy of not commenting on the process. No comment was available from Aer Lingus.
The EU regulator said in a confidential charge sheet, known as a statement of objections, in March that it was concerned about the deal's impact on competition, especially at Dublin airport.

It noted Aer Lingus and Ryanair were head-to-head rivals and the number of routes on which they competed had risen to 37 from eight in the past six years, driving prices down.

Ryanair also offered to sell Aer Lingus's slots at London's Heathrow airport. The commission considered that would not solve the problem.

Shares in Ryanair fell by 12 cent or 2.25 per cent in Dublin yesterday to close at €5.21. Aer Lingus was unchanged at €2.94.

Even if the commission had approved the Ryanair deal, it would encounter problems as the Government, which owns 25 per cent of Aer Lingus, has opposed the transaction, along with employees and other shareholders.

The European Commission has also laid the legal groundwork to force Ryanair to sell some or all of its 25 per cent shareholding in Aer Lingus, which Mr O'Leary has said he intends to keep. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

* EU to bar Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission, in a rare move, is expected to reject Ryanair's proposed purchase of rival Irish airlineAer Lingus, sources familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.

The prohibition of Ryanair's unsolicited offer, originally valued at 1.48 billion euros ($2 billion), will be only the 20th in more than 3,000 cases reviewed by the European Union's executive arm since 1990, and the first since 2004.
* Global air traffic up in 1st 4 months of 2007-IATA

VANCOUVER, British Columbia (Reuters) - International air passenger traffic rose by 6.7 percent in the first four months of the year, driven by a relatively strong global economy, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Wednesday.

Cross-border freight traffic was up a more sluggish 2.6 percent compared to the same period a year ago as carriers faced heavy competition from other types of transport, IATA said in a statement.
* Polish aiport looking for first foreign investor

WARSAW (Reuters) - PLB, a Polish airport operator controlled by the northern city of Bydgoszcz, is in talks to sell a minority stake, which could make it the first Polish airport with a foreign investor, its head said on Wednesday.

The potential sale of a minority stake in PLB could signal a watershed for foreign ownership of Polish airports, which are currently held by state and local authorities.
* Japan's ANA says may start low-price airline

Page 15 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd. (ANA) may start up a low-priced airline in a pre-emptive move to ward off potentially fierce competition from Chinese rivals, its president said on Thursday.
ANA President Mineo Yamamoto said the likelihood of further deregulation in the industry and expansion at
Tokyo's Haneda and Narita airports from 2009, meant now was the time to prepare.
* Virgin says may launch new Australian airline

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian airlineVirgin Blue Holdings Ltd. said on Thursday it was considering launching a low-cost domestic carrier to compete with a new service by Singapore's Tiger Airways due later this year.

"It is something Virgin Blue is running a ruler over and if we believe it has merit, will take a business case to the board," a spokeswoman for the airline said.
* Iberia's Conte says has not received formal bid

MADRID (Reuters) - Iberia's chairman said on Wednesday the Spanish airline had not received any formal takeover offers, but he stressed the need for sector consolidation.
* Deccan Aviation sells 26 pct to Kingfisher
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Deccan Aviation Ltd. , which runs budget airline Air Deccan, has sold a 26 percent stake to
Kingfisher Airlines at 150 rupees a share, television channels reported on Thursday.
* ANA says wants strategic tie with Shanghai Airlines

TOKYO (Reuters) - The president of Japan's All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd. (ANA) said on Thursday he would like to propose a "strategic alliance" to Shanghai Airlines Co. Ltd. .
* Leaner Northwest Airlines set for bankruptcy exit

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Northwest Airlines is set to exit bankruptcy on Thursday, marking the end of a 20-month spell in Chapter 11 for the No. 5 U.S. carrier, and the first time in almost five years that a major U.S. airline has not been in bankruptcy.

Northwest has spent the last year and a half hacking $2.4 billion off its annual costs, mostly from an aggrieved work force. Like other so-called "legacy' airlines, it has been forced to drastically slash its costs to keep pace with newer low-cost carriers and deal with wild spikes in fuel costs.
* Mauritius airline closes amid talk of state meddling

RODRIGUES, Mauritius (Reuters) - A small Mauritian airline company flew its last commercial flight on Wednesday, highlighting what critics see as a possible government intention to curb the firms of European descendants.
Catovair, owned by conglomerate IBL , said it was closing its single, loss-making service to the outer island of
Rodrigues because the government had not given it permission to expand into other more profitable routes.
* Google takes big step to make Web work offline

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Life!) - Google Inc. said on Wednesday it had created Web software that runs both online, and offline, marking a sea change for the Internet industry by letting users work on planes, trains, spotty connections and even in the most remote locations.

The technology, called Google Gears, would allow users of computers, phones and other devices to manipulate Web services like e-mail, online calendars or news readers whether online, intermittently connected to the Web or completely offline.
* WestJet VP who helped found airline to retire

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Don Bell, who helped found WestJet Airlines Ltd. 11 years ago, will leave the company in July, the air carrier said on Wednesday.
Bell will retire from his post as executive vice-president, people at Canada's No. 2 airline on July 2.

EU to clip Ryanair's  wings

The European Commission, in a highly unusual move, is expected to reject  Ryanair's proposed purchase  of rival Irish airline Aer Lingus,  sources familiar with the situation said yesterday.

The prohibition of Ryanair's unsolicited offer, originally valued at 1.48 billion euros (£1 billion), will be only the 20th in more than 3,000 cases reviewed by the European Union's executive arm since 1990, and the first since 2004.

The move comes as today Ryanair is expected to announce the start of a new domestic route from Birmingham International Airport - where it virtually abandoned services in favour of East Midlands Airport some years ago in a row over charges.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has said he would challenge the Commission in court if the deal was turned down. The decision runs to more than 300 pages in an effort to deal with issues that may end up in legal wrangling.

Commission competition spokesman Jonathan Todd declined to comment on the investigation until a final decision is taken.

The EU regulator said in a confidential charge sheet known as a statement of objections in March that it was concerned about the deal's impact on competition, especially at Dublin airport.

It noted Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, and Ryanair, an insurgent no-frills airline, were head-to-head rivals and the number of routes on which they competed had risen to 37 from eight over the past six years, driving prices down five to eight per cent.

Ryanair, whose bid lapsed automatically when the Commission launched an in-depth investigation of the deal in December, said in a confidential offer it would make space for a new rival to base as many as six planes at Dublin airport.
It also offered to sell Aer Lingus' slots at London's Heathrow and Dublin for flights between the two airports. The Commission considered that would not solve the problem.
Once the deal is blocked, the Commission may also force Ryanair to sell some or all of its 25 per cent stake in
Aer Lingus.

EU to throw out Ryanair AL bid

The EU is expected to reject  Ryanair's E1.48bn  bid for Aer Lingus  on competition grounds.

According to a source quoted by Reuters news agency, the  EC's competition department has prepared a proposed decision to present to the full Commission before a July 4 deadline.

This comes after a market test found Ryanair's latest proposed remedies for competition problems were insufficient.

Ryanair has already built up a 25pc stake in Aer Lingus. Three days after Aer Lingus floated on the Irish Stock Exchange in October Ryanair bought 16pc of the airline and made a E1.48 billion offer to buy the company. At the end of March the Commission sent a statement of objections about the bid to Ryanair, saying it is concerned the proposed deal would damage competition.

EU may bar Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus; SHARES SINK 2.5%

BRUSSELS - The European Commission, in a rare move, is expected to reject  Ryanair Holdings PLC's
proposed purchase  of rival Irish airline  Aer Lingus  Group PLC, sources familiar with the situation said yesterday.

The prohibition of Dublin-based  Ryanair's unsolicited offer, originally valued at ¤1.48-billion ($2.13-billion), will be only the 20th in more than 3,000 cases reviewed by the  European Union's executive arm since 1990, and the
first since 2004.

The competition department prepared a proposed decision to present to the full Commission before a July 4 deadline, after a market test found Ryanair's latest proposed remedies for competition problems were insufficient.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has said he would challenge the commission in court if the deal were turned down. The decision runs to more than 300 pages in an effort to deal with issues that may end up in court, one of the sources said.

Commission competition spokesman Jonathan Todd declined comment on the investigation until a final decision is taken. A spokesman for Ryanair said: "We have a policy of not commenting on this process."

The EU regulator said in a confidential charge sheet known as a statement of objections in March it was concerned about the deal's impact on competition, especially at the Dublin airport.

It noted Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, and Ryanair, an insurgent no-frills airline, were head-to-head rivals and the number of routes on which they competed had risen to 37 from eight in the past six years, driving prices down
5% to 8%.

Ryanair, whose bid lapsed automatically when the commission launched an in-depth investigation of the deal in December, said in a confidential offer it would make space for a new rival to base as many as six planes at Dublin airport.

Ryanair also offered to sell Aer Lingus' slots at London's Heathrow and Dublin for flights between the two airports. The commission considered that would not solve the problem.
Ryanair shares fell 2.5% to ¤5.20 in Dublin trading yesterday. "The EU move was anticipated and everybody
knew it was coming, but for those who needed the confirmation this may very well have encouraged them to sell,"
said a Dublin-based trader. It also looked to have been the trigger for some people to sell down the stock ahead
of Ryanair's full-year results next Tuesday, he added.

The prohibition would be only the second of Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes' tenure, though two other deals were withdrawn in the face of certain rejection.

Even if the commission had approved the Ryanair deal there would have been problems because the Irish government, which holds 25% of Aer Lingus, opposed the transaction. So did several other stockholders.

Ryanair's Mr. O'Leary has been commenting on the proposed deal throughout the bidding process. At one point he said the company would consider a second bid for Aer Lingus if Ryanair received a favourable outcome from the EU review and the Irish takeover panel. But he had also said he expected the deal to be blocked. Once the deal is blocked, the European Commission may not be finished with Ryanair.

It has laid the legal groundwork to force Ryanair to sell some or all of its one-quarter holding in Aer Lingus. Mr. O'Leary has said he intends to keep the 25%.

European Union regulators plan to block  Ryanair Holdings Plc's  bid to buyAer Lingus  Plc after the discount carrier failed to overcome competition issues at Dublin's airport, three people familiar with the case said.

Officials at the European Commission, the EU's antitrust regulator, found that Ryanair's offer to sell slots for takeoffs and landings in Dublin wouldn't resolve competition obstacles, said the people, who declined to be identified because the decision isn't public. The regulator will rule by July 4.

Rising profits for Ryanair

Ryanair said profit jumped 33% to €401.4 million (£272 million) but that profit growth would slow to 5% for the financial year because of increased air passenger duty and airport price increases. The no frills airline warned shareholders to be cautious.  Ryanair also said it might be prepared to sell some  Aer Lingus  Heathrow slots so that the  European Commission will allow Ryanair's take over bid of the Irish national carrier. Ryanair has also offered to sell slots at Dublin airport too in order to overcome the Commission's opposition to the bid.

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair said it had bought a further 27 Boeing 737-800 planes worth USD$1.9 billion at list prices. Ryanair said the planes were scheduled for delivery between September 2009 and March 2010, and take its 737s flying and on firm order to 308. Discounts are common on aircraft, but Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar and Boeing officials declined to say what price the Irish airline would pay for each plane, which carries a sticker price of USD$66 million - USD$75 million. Ryanair is Europe's largest budget airline and a
long-standing 737 customer. It has 137 flying and another 171 on order. Jun 1, 2007

Ryanair Exec: EU Unlikely  To Clear Aer LingusTakeover

LONDON (Dow Jones)--European Union antitrust regulators look unlikely to clear  Ryanair Holdings PLC's (RYAAY) planned takeover of Aer Lingus  Group PLC (EIL1.DB) following an extended investigation,  Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar said Tuesday.
"It's remote-to-unlikely," Millar told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. [ 05-06-07 0611GMT ]
Millar added that Ryanair intends to hold onto its 25.2% stake in Aer Lingus even if Brussels blocks the bid. "I
think we regard it as a strategic investment ... We hope to get control at some stage," he said.
Ryanair earlier Tuesday posted higher full-year profits and announced a share buyback program worth up to
EUR300 million.

The company ruled out paying a recurring dividend as part of its deliberations on how to return cash to shareholders, Millar said.

Ryanair vows to fight EU over Aer Lingus
290 words

BNFD

Ryanair has re-iterated that it will take legal action if the  European Commission rules that it must sell its 25pc stake in Aer Lingus.

The European Union competition authorities are widely expected to reject  Ryanair's takeover bid, which has been on hold since December. The  EU verdict is expected by July 4.
Speculation has grown over recent days that the Commission could even rule that Ryanair must sell its stake. The Irish government - which retained a 25pc Aer Lingus stake in September when it floated the previously
state-controlled airline on the Irish and British stock exchanges - opposes the Ryanair approach, as do
employee-controlled trusts accounting for about 20pc more shareholders. "It's very much a long shot, very much
unlikely, that we will get EU competition approval," Ryanair said today. However, the airline has again vowed to
challenge any EU rejection in European courts. That legal action "has a high prospect of success," the airline
claims. "Any failure by the European Commission to approve this merger will be an entirely political decision to
put the narrow political interests of the Irish Government before those of European competition and European
consumers," Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said in London today. The comments came as the airline
today announced record full year profits for 2006, but warned that only modest profit growth is expected in the
current year. Full year net profit soared 33pc to E401m, around E11m ahead of previous guidance, on revenue up
32pc to E2.24bn. Passenger traffic grew by 22pc to 42.5m while yields, reflecting average fares, rose 7pc. Shares
in the airline were down 6pc or 36c to 5.05 in Dublin today.

Adding a bit of Irish green to the Old World's blue skies, Ryanair Holdings offers low-fare, no-frills air transportation throughout  Europe via its main subsidiary, Ryanair. The carrier flies to about 115 destinations, including about two dozen in Ireland and the UK; overall, it serves more than 20 countries.  Ryanair specializes in short-haul routes between secondary and regional airports. It operates from about 15 bases, including airports in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden, as well as in Ireland and the UK.  Ryanair maintains a fleet of some 110 Boeing 737-800s. In October 2006  Ryanair announced plans to  buy rival Irish airline Aer Lingus  for about $1.9 billion.
Shares were down 6% posting record profit.

Ryanair Holdings PLC posted a record full-year 2006 profit Tuesday June 5, 2007 amid higher fuel prices and strong competition, but offered a cautious forecast for 2007.

The Dublin-based airline said net income, excluding exceptional items, rose 33 percent to 401.4 million euros ($541.7 million) in the 12 months through March 31, while sales rose 32 percent to nearly 2.24 billion euros ($3.02 billion).

But chief executive Michael O'Leary said he expected to post less stellar growth in 2007, with overall profit growth slowing to 5 percent, mirroring the percentage drop for an average ticket.

"Forward bookings and yields continue to be soft and Ryanair continues to respond with aggressive price promotions. ... Ryanair will lead and win every fare war in Europe, because Ryanair has the lowest costs and the lowest fares," O'Leary said in a statement.

O'Leary said Ryanair expected most of its fiscal 2007 profits to be generated from April to September, while the airline could suffer "small losses" in the October 2007-March 2008 period.

Ryanair said its average ticket price rose 7 percent in the last year, while sales of "ancillary" products -- insurance, car and hotel
booking, baggage-checking charges, food and beverages -- rose 40 percent to 362.1 million euros ($488.7 million).
Offsetting some of those gains, fuel costs rose 50 percent to 693.3 million euros ($935.7 million), representing 39 percent of total operating expenses, up from 35 percent in fiscal 2005.
Airport and handling charges -- always a sore point for Ryanair, which seeks out far-flung airports willing to charge less -- increased by 27 percent to 273.6 million euros ($369.3 million).
Ryanair said it sold 82 percent of its seats in fiscal 2006, down one point, reflecting its rapidly expanding route network.


Page 28 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Ryanair's strong financial position versus other European budget carriers is underscored by its growing cash reserves. These rose 8.7 percent over the year to 2.2 billion euros ($2.97 billion), even though Ryanair spent
344.9 million euros ($465.5 million) to acquire a 25.2 percent stake in its Dublin-based rival, Aer Lingus.

O'Leary and deputy chief executive, Frank Millar, both said they expect European Union competition authorities to reject Ryanair's takeover bid. The EU verdict is expected by July 4.
The Irish government -- which retained a 25 percent Aer Lingus stake in

September when it floated the previously state-controlled airline on the Irish and British stock exchanges -- opposes Ryanair, as do
employee-controlled trusts accounting for about 20 percent of shareholders.

"It's very much a long shot, very much unlikely, that we will get EU competition approval," Millar told Irish broadcaster RTE.
But O'Leary vowed to challenge any EU rejection in European courts.

He said, given what he called the EU's "significant inaccuracies and omissions" in its initial assessments of a merged Ryanair- Aer Lingus operation, that legal action "has a high prospect of success." Ryanair, which was founded in 1985, employs 4,500 people and operates 487 routes from 20 European bases operating an all- Boeing network. It carried 42.5 million passengers last year and expects to carry more than 52 million this year.

Ryanair's deputy chief executive Howard Millar has said  Ryanair is unlikely to be successful in its proposed  bid
for Aer Lingus.
Mr Millar said that it is a "long shot" that the low-fares airline would get  EU Competition Commission approval to
buy its rival.
He added that the airline would not be selling its stake in Aer Lingus. Document IRISEX0020070605e3650015q

O'Leary ready to sell Lingus  stake if Brussels rejects  bid
324 words
6 June 2007
Irish Independent
IINM
English
(c) 2007 Independent Newspapers Ireland Ltd
RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary has paved the way for selling off the low cost carrier's 25pc stake in  Aer Lingus, and has admitted the  takeover attempt has been a "distraction" for the budget airline.

Speaking to analysts after yesterday's results, O'Leary said he now "expected" the  European Commission to move to prohibit  Ryanair's hostile  take over of Aer Lingus.

"[If that happens] and someone wants to offer us a big return on our 25pc stake, we're always happy to talk to anyone," he said, adding, "I don't suspect there will be many takers."
Takeover bid

When Ryanair announced its takeover bid last October, O'Leary insisted the bid would not distract him from his day job. Yesterday, however, he told analysts that Ryanair had been "heavily distracted dealing with the European Commission (EC)".

"It has taken up a disproportionate amount of my time in particular," he admitted. "At least, whatever happens on July 4 [when the EC is due to give its decision], then it's done and out of the way. Normal service will be resumed."
O'Leary said that if the Commission blocks the move, as he now expects, the move will be "purely political".
"We have offered to reduce Aer Lingus fares by €100m per annum; we have offered to transfer Aer Lingus slots in
Heathrow to BA or Air France; we have offered to hand over a significant percentage of Dublin slots to base up to
10 aircraft there - no matter what we offer, it appears that the EC is uninterested," he said. If the EC does block
the merger, Ryanair will challenge the decision in the European Court.

"We believe we'll overturn it because the statement of objections [which outlines the competition issues raised by a Ryanair/ Aer Lingus merger] is such a patently inaccurate document," O'Leary said.

O’Leary vows to ‘lead and win’ low-cost price war
By James Moore
606 words
6 June 2007
The Independent

BUSINESS

Ryanair yesterday warned that a fierce price war would put a brake on profits next year as its ever combative chief executive Michael O’Leary lambasted  European regulators for their stance on his plans to  take over the Irish rival Aer Lingus.

Shares in the low-cost airline tumbled to €5 from €5.35 as he issued a “cautious and conservative” forecast for next year’s profit growth of just 5 per cent compared to 42 per cent this year.

Mr O’Leary said the company would be hit by “unjustifiable” price hikes at Stansted and Dublin airports and attacked BAA for its highly contentious plans to “waste almost £4bn building a second runway and terminal [which should cost less than £1bn]” at the Essex airport.
He also attacked what he described as Dublin’s “ludicrous plans to waste over €800m [£543m] building a 15
MPPA passenger terminal which Ryanair is willing to build [and pay for] at a cost of less than €200m”.
These costs will be offset by measures to hedge against rising fuel price prices.
But the company also said forward bookings and yields were “soft” and the load factor – or how full planes are –
was “weak”.

Ryanair said it was responding with more cheap flight offers and pledged to “lead and win” any fare war. Last month easy-Jet cut fares by 10 per cent.

The cautious outlook for the current financial year took the gloss off a blockbuster set of results in which pre-tax profits for the year ending 31 March surged to €451m from €339m, ahead of City forecasts. The money was earned on total operating revenues of €2.2bn against €1.7bn.
Fuel costs surged by 50 per cent to €693m, but full-year passenger traffic was up 22 per cent to 42.5 million. The figures were helped by charging passengers to check in baggage for flights and fare rises averaging 7 per
cent. Mr O’Leary described these as “a number of unusual factors” that pushed the results higher than expected.
The low-cost carrier also unveiled a share buyback of around 3.6 per cent commencing tomorrow.

Despite angrily attacking the “monopoly” practices of airport operators, and Chancellor Gordon Brown’s air-travel tax rises in this year’s Budget, Mr O’Leary saved his harshest criticism for Europe’s competition watchdogs.

He said: “I could stand buck naked in the street and I don’t think Brussels would look more favourably on Ryanair’s bid for Aer Lingus. The decision by DG Competition to refer this merger to a Phase 2 review was unprecedented and a radical departure from the Commission’s long-standing policy of encouraging EU airline consolidation.

“It is difficult to understand how the EU can wave through precedent mergers [such as Air France-KLM, Lufthansa-SAS and Lufthansa-Eurowings] in Phase 1 with minimal remedies, yet in this case a merger of two Irish airlines with bases at a peripheral European city [Dublin], which together account for less than 5 per cent of EU traffic, has been referred to Phase 2.”

Mr O’Leary said Ryanair would offer lower fares and fuel surchages of over €100m a year for Aer Lingus passengers combined with the surrender of a “significant number” of Heathrow slots and Dublin slots. “Any failure by the European Commission to approve this merger will be an entirely political decision to put the narrow political interests of the Irish Govern-ment before those of European competition and consumers,” said Mr O’Leary.

Airline  would fight takeover rebuff
248 words

English
© Irish Examiner, 2007. Thomas Crosbie Media, TCH
RYANAIR will launch a legal challenge if the  European Commission blocks its bid for Aer Lingus  or forces the budget carrier to sell its stake in the airline.

Chief executive Michael O’Leary said he believed the Commission will rule against  Ryanair and claimed the decision would be based solely on the Irish Government’s opposition to the  deal.

The European Commission has been studying the competition aspects of the proposed takeover for nearly nine months.
It is due to issue its ruling in early July.
However, apparent leaks of the Commission’s report suggest it will not allow the deal to go ahead.

Mr O’Leary said Ryanair had offered a number of remedies to satisfy the Commission’s concerns, including offering to give up two-thirds of Aer Lingus’ landing and take-off slots at Heathrow Airport.

"We also offered to hand over slots at Dublin Airport for between six to ten aircraft to any new entrant airline," he said.

He added that a combined Aer Lingus/Ryanair would not reduce competition in the aviation market and said that the EU had approved consolidation in the industry among much larger carriers, such as Air France and KLM.
Meanwhile, Aer Lingus will today announce that it has struck up deal to buy a dozen new Airbus jets.

The order, which comes after several years of negotiations with Airbus and Boeing, will allow Aer Lingus to expand its long-haul route network.

One More Thing: It looks increasingly like the  European Commission could put Dermot Mannion and Michael O'Leary out of their misery on June 27th, a week earlier than the July 4th deadline set for a decision on the phase two investigation of  Ryanair's proposed takeover of Aer Lingus.

On Monday, the advisory committee (Adcomm) to the commission's competition arm will meet to deliberate. Adcomm comprises members from national competition authorities across the  European Union. High on the agenda is Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus.  Adcomm's advice is then forwarded to the political advisers of each of
the commissioners, including Charlie McCreevy. It is then placed before the so-called college of commissioners, a meeting held every Wednesday.
Informed sources tell us that the Ryanair-Aer Lingus issue is likely to be go before the commissioners on June
27th.

That's when the fun and games should begin given that O'Leary's threat to take the commission to court if it rejects any merger or rules that Ryanair should sell some or all of its shareholding in Aer Lingus.

Business - Aer Lingus  mulls buyback  of Ryanair stake
Ken Griffin

Aer Lingus  chief executive Dermot Mannion has indicated that the airline would be willing to discuss a  buyback of Ryanair's shares if the low-cost airline is allowed to retain its stake in the event that its  takeover bid for the former state carrier is rejected by the  European Commission.

"We would certainly be willing to discuss any suggestion Ryanair might have," said Mannion. "We have a dialogue with all our major shareholders, including Ryanair, so we'd be very happy to entertain any suggestion they might have," he said.

Mannion said, however, that it was too early for the airline to draw up firm plans about how it would react in that situation.
"It's really too early to be in that space. We still haven't had the final decision from the commission."

Meanwhile, Ryanair has placed a long-term value of EUR406m on its 25.2% stake in Aer Lingus, according to its latest accounts were released early last week. The stake is listed in the figures as an "available for sale financial asset".

Ryanair spent EUR344.9m acquiring the stake, which means that even if achieved this valuation, which is regarded as modest by some observers, it would make a profit of over EUR61m on the transaction.

Last Tuesday, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary suggested for the first time that the airline might be willing to sell its Aer Lingus stake if it failed to secure European Commission approval for its bid.
"(If) someone wants to offer us a big return on our 25% stake, we're always happy to talk to anyone," he said. However, one aviation analyst, Neil Glynn of NCB Stockbrokers, said he doubted whether Aer Lingus would
attempt a buyback. Glynn said it made no sense for Aer Lingus to buy back Ryanair's shares, particularly as "it
raised funds through its IPO to fund expansion ... From anyone's perspective, the possibility of a buyback is just a
moot point. It won't happen", he said.
Glynn said he expected that if Ryanair sold its stake in Aer Lingus, it would be to another European airline. Document SUNTR00020070612e36a00024

A Lingus  to buy back Ryanair stake?

Should, as is likely, the  EU formally block Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus,  then Aer Lingus  would consider buying
back the shares owned by the no-frills airline, according to industry sources.

Aer Lingus  chief executive, Dermot Mannion said over the weekend that he would be prepared to sit down with
Ryanair and listen to their suggestions.

Ryanair spent E345m acquiring its 25.5pc shareholding in Aer Lingus as it mounted an abortive bid for the airline last year.

The EU's competition commission is due to deliver its verdict soon with many in the industry speculating that it will reject the proposal on competition grounds.

EC could rule early on Ryanair bid

THE European Commission (EC) could deliver its long-awaited ruling on  Ryanair’s proposed takeover of Aer      Lingus  later this month and earlier than originally planned.

The latest deadline for its decision has been marked down for July 4, but according to sources, the  EC could make a ruling at its commissioners meeting on June 27.

While the feeling in Brussels is that the commission is still gearing up to reject the idea of the takeover; there is also a belief too that the EC may try to force Ryanair to sell its 25% stake in Aer Lingus.

Representatives of the competition authorities of each EU member state met in Brussels yesterday at a specially held Advisory Committee meeting to voice their opinions to the commission after using the last 10 days or so to digest in full its various findings.
Ryanair has already offered a number of ‘remedies’ to matters which the EC saw as being potentially
anti-competitive — mainly concerning an overlap of slots at airports where both airlines were heavily active
(Ryanair has offered to hand over existing Aer Lingus slots at both Heathrow and Dublin Airports to rival airlines).

Last week, Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary said the airline would take legal action if the commission decided to block the bid or force Ryanair to sell its stake in Aer Lingus.

Ryanair's hopes of landing Irish flag carrier  Aer Lingus  will be frustrated by  European regulators later this month, it was reported.

The Financial Times newspaper said the  European Commission had decided a combination involving  Aer            Lingus and Europe's biggest low-cost airline would undermine competition and harm consumers.

The Commission has until July 4 to finalise its decision, but according to the FT it has drafted and circulated a ruling prohibiting the proposal. A final verdict is expected to be announced on June 27.

Until then, Ryanair has the opportunity to win over the regulator, possibly by giving up further take-off and landing slots in order to ensure competition on routes currently served by both carriers.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary shocked the airline industry in October when he unveiled the €1.48bn offer, which immediately ran into opposition from the Government, staff and pilots.
A negative ruling from the Commission would represent the first merger prohibition by Brussels since December
2004.
The FT said both Ryanair and the European Commission declined to comment on the matter. It is expected that Mr O'Leary will appeal against any decision to block the takeover. Document IRISEX0020070614e36e000ru

Ryanair's hopes of landing rival Irish airline  Aer Lingus  will be frustrated by  European regulators later this month, it was reported yesterday.
The European Commission was said to have decided a combination involving  Aer Lingus  and Ryanair,
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, would undermine competition and harm consumers.

It is expected that Mr O'Leary will appeal against any decision to block the takeover.

Scandinavian airline group SAS said it would sell its holdings in UK carrier BMI and two other airlines as it announced a savings package designed to cut costs by £200million.

SAS - which holds a 20% stake in BMI - said it would sell its stakes in Spanair, BMI and Air Greenland and focus on its flagship carrier Scandinavian Airlines, plus its smaller airlines.

It said it would divest units outside of its core northern European business, cut back on central administration and move its Stockholm HQ.
It was not clear whether any staff would be laid off. Both SAS and BMI operate services from Aberdeen. Document FABP000020070615e36e0000v

EU expected to block Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus  - sources

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - The  European Commission is expected to block Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC's proposed 1.48 bln hostile  acquisition of Irish flag carrier  Aer Lingus  Group PLC, sources told Thomson Financial News.

Sources said while  Ryanair has offered remedies to alleviate the commission's antitrust concerns, the moves have not been sufficient. In particular, new remedies offered during the  EU executive's in-depth second phase inquiry have not been seen as credible.

One of the sources said Aer Lingus' opposition to the deal would have created difficulties for the tie-up from the start.

The commission is set to rule on the deal by July 4, but a negative ruling could come before that -- barring a last-minute intervention. The deadline was extended several times as commitments, specifically on slots, have been offered.

Ryanair's finance director, Howard Miller told Thomson Financial News on June 5 that the group expects a "politically motivated" negative decision and that the carrier would likely challenge the commission's review of Ryanair's proposed offer in the courts.

"The Irish government is not in favour of it [the proposed merger] and the EC competition authorities generally do what the governments want to do," Miller said.

"It has approved other similar deals but when it comes to two carriers operating with less than 5 pct of the market share they decide they're not going to approve it so you can only assume it's a politically motivated decision."
His comments echoed those of Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary on May 9.

"The EU will rule in the interests of the Irish government rather than the consumer," he said. "We hope they will approve (the deal) but we suspect they won't, in which case we will immediately appeal to the European Court."
A verdict against Ryanair's lapsed bid would be "purely political", in light of the approval of Air France's tie-up with
KLM and Flybe's recent takeover of BA Connect, O'Leary said at a press conference in London.

Ryanair withdrew its 2.80 eur per share takeover bid at the end of December last year after the commission launched an in-depth inquiry citing "serious competition concerns" over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines.

The commission noted its concern over combining Ireland's two major airlines, saying it could reduce customer choice and lead to higher fares.

At the time, EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "My main priority on this case is to make sure that consumers would continue to enjoy a competitive choice of airline services."
Ryanair built up a 25.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus before launching its bid.

The deal has faced opposition from the start. Aer Lingus and its largest shareholder, the Irish government, fiercely opposed the deal. Unions have also expressed concern.

Aer Lingus  has mounted a vigorous defence of its position ahead of a ruling by the  European Union concerning the proposed takeover by Ryanair. Jun 13, 2007

Ryanair will expand operations at its Stockholm Skavsta base in October, adding a fifth and sixth Boeing 737-800 and launching 12 new routes during the month: Seven-times-weekly to Berlin Schoenefeld and Bratislava;
four-times-weekly to Eindhoven, Baden Baden, Liverpool and Valencia; thrice-weekly to Alicante, Basel, Pisa and Porto, and twice-weekly to Trapani and Malta. A twice-weekly service to Salzburg will start in December. Ryanair said it expects to carry 2.5 million passengers to and from NYO each year. Jun 15, 2007
Ryanair yesterday claimed that it now is the world's largest international airline in terms of passengers, based on
IATA statistics. The LCC carried 40.5 million passengers on international flights in 2006 compared to Lufthansa's
38.2 million, Air France's 30.4 million and British Airways' 29.5 million. Low-cost rival easyJet was sixth with 21.9
million, with American Airlines the largest non-European carrier--and seventh overall--at 21.2 million. "Just 10
years ago most of the other airlines on this IATA ranking carried 10 times more passengers than Ryanair," the
airline said. Jun 14, 2007

Ryanair's plans to launch inflight mobile phones in cooperation with OnAir have been delayed by four months as regulatory approval has taken longer than expected, the Irish Independent confirmed. The system has approval from relevant Irish authorties, but a handful of other countries, mainly in Scandinavia, have yet to agree. CEO Michael O'Leary last week conceded that the new system will not be running until November at the earliest. The LCC and SITA announced last summer that Ryanair would outfit its entire 737 fleet with OnAir's onboard mobile communications solution. OnAir was scheduled to equip 50 aircraft during the second half with the remainder receiving installations from early 2008. Jun 11, 2007

Ryanair CEO: Co Will Appeal If Aer LingusDeal Is Blocked

LONDON (Dow Jones)--  Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY) will mount a legal challenge if the European Union Commission blocks the company's proposed  takeover of Aer Lingus  Group PLC (EIL1.DB), Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary reiterated at a media conference Tuesday.

O'Leary called it remarkable that "for the first time in 20 years" the commission would prohibit a  merger of two airlines "despite its rubber stamping of much bigger deals."

Ryanair expects the commission to announce its blocking of the deal sometime in the first week of July. The appeal process could lead to a ruling within six months but will most likely be delayed, O'Leary said.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said that if the  European Commission rejects the budget airline's proposed merger with Aer Lingus  it would "clearly be a political decision aimed at appeasing the Irish Government". He said that it was difficult to see how British Airways could pursue a  merger with Iberia, in which it has a large minority stake, if the  Ryanair- Aer Lingus  proposal is spurned.

************************************************************ * EU Commission set to quash Ryanair's Aer Lingus bid
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ryanair , Europe's biggest budget airline, will lose its attempt to take over Irish rival Aer
Lingus when the European Commission vetoes the bid on Wednesday, sources familiar with the matter say.

The Commission, executive arm of the European Union, will take the unusual step of blocking the unsolicited bid in order to prevent the two carriers from becoming a single, dominant operator at Dublin Airport and stifling competition there.
* Customer service a casualty of U.S. airline recovery

CHICAGO (Reuters) - As frustrated as travelers may be with crowded planes and delayed flights, these are the realities of the leaner U.S. airline industry as it claws its way back to profitability after a brutal years-long slump.

If carriers want to ensure long-term survival, they say they have no choice but to restrain capacity, fill as many seats as possible and cut costs wherever they can.
And for travelers who don't like it, there is always the bus.

Experts say carriers are unlikely to lose much business as a result of recent big snafus like Wednesday's systemwide computer glitch at UAL Corp.'s United Airlines that delayed nearly 270 flights.
* Delta, American raise domestic fares $5 each way


Page 51 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc. and AMR Corp's American Airlines raised fares by $5 each way in most domestic markets, the No. 3 and No. 1 U.S. airlines said on Friday, in the latest test of airline pricing power.

U.S. airlines have struggled recently to raise fares to offset rising fuel costs, as competitors have failed to match the increases amid softening demand for air travel.
* Aeroflot to pull out of Alitalia bidding
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian airline Aeroflot will announce within days that it is pulling out of the bidding for
Italian airline Alitalia, Interfax news agency cited an unnamed board member as saying on Saturday.
* KKR wins Air Canada unit, aims to go global

TORONTO (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. plans to go global with the Air Canada Technical Services after it outbid its rivals for a controlling interest in the airline's maintenance division, a Canadian newspaper reported on Friday.
* Schiphol angry at long debate on firm's future

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The directors of Amsterdam airport operator Schiphol Group [SCHP.UL] have written to the Dutch finance ministry complaining about the protracted talks over moves to privatise the airport, a Dutch paper reported.

De Telegraaf said on Saturday it had obtained a copy of the letter in which the directors of Schiphol refuse an invitation from Finance Minister Wouter Bos to meet in July and present again their case for privatisation.
* ACE Aviation to sell 70 pct of maintenance unit

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - ACE Aviation Holdings Inc. agreed on Friday to sell a major stake in its maintenance division to Sageview Capital LLC and an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. .

ACE, the parent company of Air Canada , will sell 70 percent of its Air Canada Technical Services (ACTS) unit to the consortium, agreeing to hold the remaining stake and stay as the unit's biggest customer.
* Turkey's Celebi to bid for Czech Airlines terminal
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's Celebi Airport Services said on Monday it would bid in a tender for the sale of
Czech Airlines' catering operation and cargo terminal subsidiary Air Cargo Terminal operating in Prague airport.
* ADP airports eyes 20 mln extra passengers by 2010

PARIS (Reuters) - Paris airports operator Aeroports de Paris will invest 2.7 billion euros to bolster by 20 million passengers the capacity of Charles de Gaulle airport by 2010, its chief executive told a newspaper on Monday.

ADP handled 56.6 million passengers last year at Charles de Gaulle while its official capacity was 47 million, Pierre Graff told daily Le Parisien.
* Thai Airways sees 07/08 revenues up 3-5 pct

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai Airways International said on Monday it expected a 3-5 percent rise in revenues in the year to September 2008 from the 200 billion baht ($6.22 billion) expected in the previous financial year.
The national carrier should earn a net profit margin of 6-7 percent for the year, in line with the industry, president
Apinan Sumanaseni told reporters.
* Alaska Airlines unit revs fall in May

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alaska Air Group Inc. said on Friday that Alaska Airlines' passenger revenues per available seat mile, or unit revenues, fell 2.3 percent in May on lower ticket prices and fewer passengers.
* Govt to approve Kuwait Airways plane deal
KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait's cabinet will give initial approval on Sunday to plans by state carrier Kuwait Airways
Corp. [KA.UL] to buy aircraft from local lessor Aviation Lease and Finance Co. (ALAFCO), a newspaper said.

* Germany's airport Cologne-Bonn fit for IPO

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Cologne-Bonn airport is in shape for an initial public offering, but a listing is still a long way away, the airport's chief executive told a German newspaper in an interview published on Sunday.
* Private sector to bridge gap in U.S. space flight

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - Far from being a hiatus in U.S. manned space travel, the gap between the retirement of the U.S. space shuttle and the debut of replacement ships looks set to be a renaissance led by private companies.

NASA, which on Friday saw the safe return of the shuttle Atlantis, is providing financial assistance to two private companies and technical advice and oversight to five others.

Media reports out of Brussels Monday and in recent weeks have suggested that  European anti-trust authorities will block the deal largely on the two carriers' hefty combined market share at Dublin Airport.  Ryanair executives have said they don't now believe the proposed  takeover will be approved and may appeal the ruling or a move by the E.U. to force the low-cost carrier to sell its 25.2% stake in  Aer Lingus.

The Commission could give its ruling on the proposed  takeover as early as Wednesday, a person familiar with the matter said. A  Ryanair spokesman declined to comment on the situation.

Ryanair has offered a number of concessions in order to get E.U. approval for the takeover, including the surrender of Aer Lingus' valuable runway slots at London's Heathrow Airport. Both airlines serve the busy Dublin-London market albeit to different airports around the U.K. capital.

Ryanair let its EUR1.48 billion offer lapse in December when the E.U. opened an in-depth anti-trust investigation but has said it will look to bid again if it received regulatory approval.

In order to get the merger cleared Ryanair had offered a number of concessions to lessen the impact of the dominant position in the Irish markets, but virtually none of the Commission's regular steps for processing these remedies were observed, a person close to the deal said. There was no "dotting the i.'s and crossing the t's going on," which gives a strong impression the commission will produce a negative decision, the person said. Ryanair's offer to surrender of Aer Lingus' valuable runway slots at London's Heathrow Airport were simply
window-dressing and not enough to open serious negotiations with the Commission, some lawyers familiar with the case have said.

The EU is set to reject  Ryanair's E1.48 billion  bid for Aer Lingus  when the European Commission vetoes the
bid on Wednesday.
According to a source quoted by Reuters news agency, the  European Union competition authorities are to reject
Ryanair's takeover bid, which has been on hold since December.

The airline has already said that it is unlikely that they will get EU competition approval. However, the airline has vowed to challenge any EU rejection in European courts Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, on whose recommendation the Commission will act, has blocked only one other deal during her tenure Ryanair has already built up a 25pc stake in Aer Lingus. Three days after Aer Lingus floated on the Irish Stock Exchange in October Ryanair bought 16pc of the airline and made a E1.48 billion offer to buy the company. At the end of March the Commission sent a statement of objections about the bid to Ryanair, saying it is concerned the proposed deal would damage competition

PREVIEW-EU Commission set to quash Ryanair's  Aer Lingusbid

BRUSSELS, June 25 (Reuters) - Ryanair , Europe's biggest budget airline, will lose its attempt to  take over Irish rival Aer Lingus  when the European Commission vetoes the  bid on Wednesday, sources familiar with the
matter say.

The Commission, executive arm of the  European Union, will take the unusual step of blocking the unsolicited  bid in order to prevent the two carriers from becoming a single, dominant operator at Dublin Airport and stifling competition there.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, on whose recommendation the Commission will act, has blocked only one other deal during her tenure.

The offer, originally valued at 1.48 billion euros ($2 billion), will mark the 20th prohibition among more than 3,000 cases reviewed by the EU executive since 1990, and the first since 2004.

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has said publicly that he expects the deal to be blocked and that he plans to appeal to the EU Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.
He also wants to hold on to the 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus that his company owns.

The Commission, however, has laid the groundwork to force him to cut back or sell all of that holding and will decide later whether to do so.

Both airlines are based at Dublin Airport and serve a market where few others have shown an interest in establishing a base.

The EU regulator in March issued a confidential charge sheet, known as a statement of objections, that laid out a tough case against the merger.
In some ways, Aer Lingus owes its own success to Ryanair.

Ryanair's cut-rate prices and expanding choice of destinations have forced Aer Lingus to transform from a staid, high-priced flag carrier into a tough no-frills competitor ready to match O'Leary ticket for ticket and route for route.

The charge sheet said that in the past six years the number of routes on which the carriers competed had jumped to 37 from eight, driving prices down by 5 to 8 percent.

Ryanair offered proposals it said could ensure competition, but they were never enough to satisfy the Commission. For example, it offered to make space for a new rival to base as many as six planes at Dublin Airport.
Ryanair also offered to sell Aer Lingus' slots at London's Heathrow and Dublin for flights between the two airports. RYANAIR-EU/ (PREVIEW)|LANGEN|UKI|ABN|E|RBN|D|RNP|DNP|PCO

BRUSSELS, June 26, 2007 (AFP) -

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary launched a pre-emptive strike Tuesday against  EU regulators blocking the Irish low cost carrier from taking over  Aer Lingus  by vowing to appeal.
Although the European Commission has until July 4 to rule on the deal, O'Leary said he expected the EU
competition watchdog to veto the takeover on Wednesday.
In anticipation of the decision, he said: "Ryanair will appeal this prohibition to the ECJ (European Court of Justice)
and seek to have it overturned."
"This prohibition reverses 20 years of EU airlines consolidation," O'Leary told a news conference in Brussels. Ryanair launched an unsuccessful takeover bid last October, valuing Aer Lingus at 1.481 billion euros (1.992
billion dollars), only days after Aer Lingus was partly floated on the London and Dublin stock exchanges.

But the biggest European low-cost carrier retracted its bid in December after EU regulators launched a competition probe into the deal.
Ryanair nonetheless added at the time that it would make a new offer if it got regulatory clearance.

Describing the EU's anticipated veto as "unlawful" and "nakedly political," O'Leary said: "We will reconsider the offer if the court overturns the decision."

He also accused the European Commission of organising "persistent and repeated" leaks of confidential information on the process and decision-making of the case and said the airline filed a formal complaint with the EU ombudsman.

European Commission spokesman for competition issues Jonathan Todd hit back at O'Leary's attack, telling journalists in a separate news conference that "it's very easy to criticise a decision that's not yet been taken."

"As for the suggestion that the Commission would take a political decision, I can refute that completely because the Commission is under an obligation to be completely impartial and objective," he added.

Todd also "categorically" denied O'Leary's leak charges, saying: "Trying to get information about a merger case out of the Commission is about as easy as trying to get blood out of a stone."

Aer Lingus weighed into the flurry of accusations, saying that O'Leary was just "lashing out" to hide the "failure" of his takeover bid.
"Michael O'Leary has sought to 'take out' his closest competitor and he has failed," chief executive Dermot
Mannion said "He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure.

"If the EU Commission announces a prohibition decision following its exhaustive investigation, it will represent another boost for Aer Lingus and for consumers."

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary launched a pre-emptive strike Tuesday against  EU regulators blocking the Irish low cost carrier from taking over  Aer Lingus,  by vowing to appeal.
Although the European Commission has until July 4 to rule on the deal, O'Leary said he expected the EU

In anticipation of the decision, the low-cost carrier's combative multi-millionaire said: "Ryanair will appeal this prohibition to the ECJ (European Court of Justice) and seek to have it overturned."
"This prohibition reverses 20 years of EU airlines consolidation," O'Leary told a news conference in Brussels. Ryanair launched an unsuccessful takeover bid last October, valuing Aer Lingus at 1.481 billion euros (1.992

Describing the EU's anticipated veto as "unlawful" and "nakedly political," O'Leary said: "We will reconsider the offer if the court overturns the decision."

The straight-talking, media-savvy Irishman also accused the European Commission of organising "persistent and repeated" leaks of confidential information on the process and decision-making of the case and said the airline filed a formal complaint with the EU ombudsman.

European Commission spokesman for competition issues Jonathan Todd hit back at O'Leary's attack, telling journalists in a separate news conference that "it's very easy to criticise a decision that's not yet been taken."

"If the EU Commission announces a prohibition decision following its exhaustive investigation, it will represent another boost for Aer Lingus and for consumers."

The showdown is not O'Leary's first clash with European regulators. They told Ryanair in 2004 to repay several million euros of state money received to set up operations at the Belgium airport of Charleroi.

If Ryanair ends up taking the regulators' to court, it could be at least a year before there is a ruling.

Regulatory issues aside, Ryanair, which already has a 25.2-percent stake in Aer Lingus, also faces an upward battle winning over big shareholders that are opposed to the takeover.

The Irish government still holds a 25.4 percent stake in Aer Lingus, while employees own 14.4 percent of the airlines' shares, and another 4.1 percent is in the hands of pilots and their pension fund.

Ryanair says EU will unfairly block its Aer Lingus  bid to please Irish government

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  Ryanair Holdings PLC,  Europe's largest low-cost airline, said Tuesday that it expects the European Commission to block its €1.48 billion (US$1.9 billion) hostile  takeover bid for fellow Irish airline Aer Lingus  PLC.
It claimed the decision -- to be made before July 4 -- was politically motivated and was designed to appease the
Irish government.

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he planned to challenge an EU refusal to approve the takeover at the EU courts.

A block would be unprecedented, he said, as it was a deal that he claimed would cut air fares and fuel surcharges, amounting to €100 million (US$135 million) in savings.

"This is a nakedly political decision ... looking after the narrow vested interests of the Irish government," he told reporters in Brussels.

He claimed that a block would make further takeovers between European airlines more difficult, such as a possible bid by Air One for Alitalia or a British Airways-led consortium offer for Iberia.
Only Dublin and Aer Lingus had made antitrust complaints about the deal, he said.

Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said in November that he was rigorously opposed to a new airline monopoly that could emerge if Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus succeeded.
The two airlines control over 70 percent of the Irish short-haul market but less than 5 percent of the entire
European market.

Ryanair says it competes directly against Aer Lingus Group PLC on only 17 out of 500 routes but analysts say that number is higher if cities, rather than airports, are used to define routes. Ryanair usually flies to smaller airports farther away from the city destination, using a shuttle bus to connect the two.

Ryanair threatens  to sue EU if it blocks  Aer Lingustakeover

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Low-fare airline Ryanair vowed Tuesday to sue  EU regulators if they blocked its hostile takeover bid for fellow Irish airline Aer Lingus,  claiming it was the victim of political bias.

The European Commission has until July 4 to block or clear the  deal and has pointed to "serious competition concerns" with the proposed combination of Ireland's two major airlines because it could reduce customer choice and raise fares.

But Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary said he expected the EU's executive arm to refuse him permission to buy the former state-owned carrier, a "politically motivated" decision that he said aimed to please the Irish government, Aer Lingus PLC's biggest shareholder.

"This is a nakedly political decision ... It's all to do with looking after the narrow vested interests of the Irish government," he told reporters in Brussels.

EU spokesman Jonathan Todd refused to confirm that the EU would block the deal, saying only that consumer interests were "at the foremost in the Commission mind" during its antitrust probe.

Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said O'Leary was just a sore loser whose attempt to eliminate his nearest rival had failed. "He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure," Mannion said.

O'Leary said only Dublin and Aer Lingus oppose the deal, claiming that the €1.48 billion (US$1.9 billion) deal would neither create an EU monopoly or harm customers because he planned to reduce Aer Lingus fares by 10 percent in the first year and scrap fuel surcharges.
"It would be a remarkable decision, a historical unprecedented decision for the Commission to turn down a
merger of two airlines with less than 5 percent of the EU market and to turn down a merger that for the first time in
the history of EU airline consolidation guarantees a €100 million (US$135 million) per annum in fare cuts,"
O'Leary said.

"It also sends a message that it's going to be much more difficult for EU airline consolidation to proceed," he said, pointing to a possible takeover of Alitalia by its Italian rival Air One and British Airways PLC's potential bid for Iberia.

But regulators are more worried about customer choice because the two airlines overlap on a number of European routes and are each other's closest competitors for services out of Ireland. The country has few passenger ferry links to Britain and continental Europe.
Together the two would control more than 60 percent of all flights in and out of Dublin's only commercial airport. The European Commission rarely blocks deals -- stopping only one since 2001 -- and usually seeks selloffs or
changes to business behavior to remove antitrust concerns.

O'Leary said Ryanair had tried to soothe antitrust worries of shrinking competition at Dublin by offering Aer Lingus' coveted slots at London Heathrow to British Airways and Air France in return for those airlines and one other starting new routes out of Dublin.


Page 68 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission had previously cleared Air France and KLM to combine even though both had more than a 60 percent share at Paris Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Schiphol airports, O'Leary said.

"It's not a principle we expect will stand up in the European court and if it was ... then Air France would not have been allowed to buy KLM," he said.
Growing rapidly from its Irish base into Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Ryanair has revolutionized travel in
Europe, spearheading no-frills cheap flights that forced others to do the same.

O'Leary claimed his bid for Aer Lingus -- opposed by nearly half of the shareholders -- was good news for the share price as word of a possible EU regulatory refusal had sent shares slipping from €3 (US$4.04) to a new low of €2.39 (US$3.22) on Tuesday morning.
"There's nobody else out there who wants to acquire a small loss-making European airline," he said.

Ryanair set for big European nosedive  over Aer Lingustakeover

AVIATION
Dublin-based Ryanair - Europe's biggest budget airline - will lose its attempt to  take over Irish rival Aer Lingus
when the European Commission vetoes the  bid tomorrow, sources claimed yesterday.

The Commission, executive arm of the European Union, will take the unusual step of blocking the unsolicited bid in order to prevent the two carriers from becoming a single, dominant operator at Dublin Airport and stifling competition there.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, on whose recommendation the Commission will act, has stopped only one other deal during her tenure.

The offer, originally valued at 1.48 billion euros (£1 billion), will mark the 20th prohibition among more than 3,000 cases reviewed by the EU executive since 1990, and the first since 2004.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has said publicly that he expects the deal to be halted and that he plans to appeal to the EU Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.
He also wants to hold on to the 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus that his company owns.

The Commission, however, has laid the groundwork to force him to cut back or sell all of that holding and will decide later whether to do so.

Both airlines are based at Dublin Airport and serve a market where few others have shown an interest in establishing a base. Both operate services from Birmingham.

Ryanair offered proposals it said could meet competition concerns, but they were never enough to satisfy the Commission. For example, it offered to make space for a new rival to base as many as six planes at Dublin Airport.
Ryanair also offered to sell Aer Lingus' slots at London's Heathrow and Dublin for flights between the two airports. Meanwhile, low-cost airline easy Jet said it had reached agreement with European planemaker Airbus to exercise
options for 3 5 Airbus A319 aircraft for delivery during 2011 and 2012.
Industry sources had said last week that the order for the single-aisle aircraft was worth around EUR2.4 billion
(£1.206 billion) at list prices, though easy Jet said the deal was subject to substantial price concessions.

"This major new aircraft order supports our continuing growth making us one of Europe's largest airlines," chief executive Andy Harrison said in a statement.

The airline said the total size of its order with Airbus, including options, is 315 aircraft, of which 105 have so far been delivered.
Easy Jet said the latest order means it now has 122 aircraft on firm order with Airbus, with a list price of over
EUR7 billion (£3.51 billion).

EU hits back at O'Leary "political" jibe

The European Commission said it 'refutes completely' Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary's claim it would make a 'nakedly political' decision on its  bid for Aer Lingus.
'I can refute that (claim) completely,'  EU competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said.
'The commission is under an obligation to be completely impartial and objective,' he added.

'It is very easy to criticise a decision which has not yet been taken,' he said, noting the deadline for the inquiry is July 4. 'A decision will be taken at the latest by July 4, until such time I cannot make any comment of prejudge the commission's decision,' Todd said. O'Leary said this morning the expected veto would be 'unjustified' and a
'nakedly political' decision. In response to O'Leary's claims that the EU leaked information regarding the process and decision-making of the file, Todd said the commission had not leaked any information about any ongoing merger investigation. 'Trying to get merger information out of the commission is as easy as trying to get blood out of a stone,' he told reporters here. 'If anyone here has ever obtained information from the commission regarding an ongoing merger inquiry I would invite you to raise your hand now... I cannot see any hands raised,' he said. Todd said the reason why the deal was being scrutinised was due to the fact that both airlines operate out of the same home base airport. He said the potential market overlap would be higher in this case, compared to other cases involving airlines, which operate out of different home bases

Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary today said the that carrier expects the  European Commission in the coming week to block its proposed E1.48 billion hostile  acquisition of Aer Lingus.

The no-frills airline held a press conference in Brussels to respond to the recent  European Commission leaks indicating that  Ryanair's offer for  Aer Lingus  will be prohibited.

Speaking at today's press conference, O'Leary said the prohibition is "unjustified in the case of two airlines, which between them account for less than 5pc of the EU air travel market.

The airline said that the prohibition reverses 20 years of EU airline consolidation which has seen the Commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors including Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa/Austrian, all with minimal remedies. O'Leary said the decision is "politically motivated, designed to appease the narrow interests of the Irish Government, which was the only party (other than Aer Lingus itself) to object to the merger. Ryanair also confirmed that it will oppose any attempt by the European Commission to require it to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair highlighted that it owns just 25pc of Aer Lingus, and has no control over Aer Lingus which remains controlled and run by the Irish Government and its trade unions.

Ryanair highlighted that it owns just 25pc of Aer Lingus, and has no control over Aer Lingus which remains controlled and run by the Irish Government and its trade unions. He added the expected veto would be
'unjustified' and a 'nakedly political' decision. Meanwhile, the European Commission today said it 'has not leaked information about any ongoing merger investigation'. A source said there were several member states or interested parties who would have a vested interest in leaking such information.

Ryanair's  O'Leary readies response  to EU

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is preparing today to respond to information that the  European Commission will block the Irish low-cost air carrier's proposed E1.48bn hostile  acquisition of flag carrier  Aer        Lingus  tomorrow.

Ryanair said O'Leary will meet reporters in Brussels to "discuss  Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus  and the European
Commission's leaked decision to block it".
Reports last week said that the commission is ready to veto the deal.

Sources said that while Ryanair has offered remedies to alleviate the commission's antitrust concerns, the moves have not been sufficient. In particular, new remedies offered during the EU executive's in-depth second phase inquiry have not been seen as credible. One of the sources said Aer Lingus' opposition to the deal would have created difficulties for the tie-up from the start. The commission was set to rule on the deal by July 4, but a negative ruling could come tomorrow, with the commissioners holding their weekly meeting. The deadline was extended several times as commitments, specifically on slots at Dublin Airport and London's Heathrow Airport, have been offered. Ryanair's finance director, Howard Miller said that the group expects a "politically motivated" negative decision and that the carrier would likely challenge the commission's review of Ryanair's proposed offer
in the courts. "The Irish government is not in favour of it (the proposed merger) and the EC competition authorities generally do what the governments want to do," Miller said. "It has approved other similar deals but when it
comes to two carriers operating with less than 5 pct of the market share, they decide they're not going to approve it, so you can only assume it's a politically motivated decision." His comments echoed those of CEO O'Leary on May 9: "The EU will rule in the interests of the Irish government rather than the consumer," he said. "We hope they will approve (the deal) but we suspect they won't, in which case we will immediately appeal to the European Court." A verdict against Ryanair's lapsed bid would be "purely political", in light of the approval of Air France's
tie-up with KLM and Flybe's recent takeover of BA Connect, O'Leary said at a press conference in London. Ryanair withdrew its E2.80 per share takeover bid at the end of December last year after the commission launched an in-depth inquiry citing "serious competition concerns" over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines. Ryanair did not withdraw the notification of the deal to regulatory authorities, though, and has said it would consider making another offer if the European Commission approved the proposed takeover. The
commission noted its concern over combining Ireland's two major airlines, saying it could reduce customer choice and lead to higher fares. At the time, EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "My main priority on this case is to make sure that consumers would continue to enjoy a competitive choice of airline services."

DUBLIN (Dow Jones)--  Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY) said Tuesday that the  European Union Wednesday will block its takeover of Irish state carrier  Aer Lingus  PLC (EIl1.DB), but said that it will launch an appeal to the European Court.

The European low-cost airline said that it condemns the E.U. Commission's yet-to-be-announced decision to thwart the bid as "unjustified."  Ryanair said it will oppose any attempt to force it to sell its 25% stake in  Aer           Lingus.

"This prohibition reverses 20 years of E.U. airline consolidation which has seen the Commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors," the company said in a statement ahead of a press conference in Brussels.

At a press conference in Brussels, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he is confident the European Court would overturn the European Commission's expected decision.

Although Ryanair has already admitted that its hostile EUR2.80-a-share, EUR1.48 billion bid for Aer Lingus was unlikely to succeed due to shareholder opposition, it hasn't ruled out a future bid for the Irish-based carrier.

Both airlines serve the busy Dublin-London market, albeit to different airports around the U.K. capital. Aer Lingus also flies to European cities, but, unlike Ryanair, flies long-haul to Dubai and several U.S. cities.
At 0925 GMT Tuesday, Aer Lingus was down 10 cents, or 3.9%, at EUR2.47 on the Irish Stock Exchange, while
Ryanair was down 0.6%, or 3 cents, at EUR5.00. The ISEQ Overall Index was down 0.7% at 9321.

Ryanair Holdings: EU To Block Aer LingusTakeover

Edited Press Release

LONDON (Dow Jones)--Ryanair, a low fares airline responded Tuesday to the recent  European Commission leaks indicating that Ryanair's offer for  Aer Lingus  will be prohibited.
Ryanair said it expects this prohibition decision to be announced by DG Competition over the coming week. Ryanair, which currently owns just 25% of Aer Lingus, said it will appeal this prohibition to the European Court of
First Instance, and seek to have it overturned.
Ryanair added it will oppose any attempt by the European Commission to require it to dispose of its stake in Aer
Lingus.
Ryanair said it condemned this prohibition decision on a number of grounds as follows:
* This prohibition reverses 20 years of E.U. airline consolidation which has seen the Commission approve all
other mergers between larger competitors including Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa/Austrian, all
with minimal remedies.
* This prohibition is unjustified in the case of two airlines which between them account for less than 5% of the
E.U. air travel market.

* The decision is politically motivated, designed to appease the narrow interests of the Irish Government, which was the only party (other than Aer Lingus itself) to object to the merger.

* This decision is bad for consumers, because it allows Aer Lingus to continue to increase its fares and levy unjustified fuel surcharges, both of which would have been reduced/eliminated had the Ryanair merger succeeded.

* The decision is manifestly erroneous as it applys a citypair analysis (e.g. claiming that Aer Lingus flights to Heathrow and Charles de Gaulle compete with Ryanair flights to Stansted and Beauvais) when every other E.U. airline merger precedents have applied an airport pair analysis (under which rules typically Heathrow and Charles de Gaulle would be deemed to be separate markets from Stansted and Beauvais respectively)", Ryanair said.

* The decision is manifestly in error since it is based on the Commission's inaccurate claim that there are barriers to entry at Dublin Airport, when the case file evidence clearly proves that there are no barriers to entry at Dublin Airport", it said.

* The decision inaccurately claims that other competitors would not enter Dublin Airport, when the case file proves that other competitors have confirmed they will enter Dublin Airport.

* The decision is based on applying a "base" competition concept which has no precedent and is a misapplication of 25 year old U.S. cases.

The Commission wrongly claims that Aer Lingus has a record of entering routes where Ryanair operates. In fact the opposite is the case. Aer Lingus has withdrawn from over 20 Ryanair routes in the past seven years, Ryanair said.

* The decision ignores the substantial consumer benefits of over EUR100 million p.a. guaranteed by Ryanair's remedies package.

Page 79 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
* This prohibition will make further European airline consolidation more difficult to proceed including for example the rumoured takeover of Alitalia by Air One, and the rumoured acquisition of Iberia by a British Airways led consortium.

* At a time when European airlines are facing renewed competition from American mega carriers under EU-U.S. Open Skies, this prohibition reverses the Commission's 20 year policy of encouraging E.U. airline consolidation, denies Aer Lingus passengers a guarantee of lower fares and zero fuel surcharges, and shows the Commission's lack of impartiality or balance in cases which conflict with the narrow vested interests of national governments.
Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said: "The European Commission's decision to prohibit this merger between two
E.U. airlines which between them represent just 5% of European airline traffic is not just unprecedented, but in
our view unlawful".

"We call on the Commission to explain how it can rubber stamp mergers between larger airlines such as Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa/Austrian, when these airlines have bigger positions at their home airports than the combined Ryanair/ Aer Lingus share at Dublin Airport", O'Leary said.

"When Air France which has over 60% share of aircraft movements at Paris CDG is allowed by the Commission (with minimal remedies) to acquire KLM which has over 60% share of movements at Schipol, it is untenable that the Commission now changes these rules, to prohibit a Ryanair/ Aer Lingus merger which will result in a similar
60% share of movements at only one airport Dublin which is currently doubling its capacity".

"Whereas the Air France/KLM merger, resulted in significant fare increases, Ryanair has offered unprecedented remedies which include over EUR100 million p.a. of guaranteed fare and fuel surcharge reductions. It is obvious that the Commission is applying a unique and unprecedented set of rules in the Ryanair/ Aer Lingus case", he said.

"The Commission's case as set out in its Statement of Objections is materially inaccurate. There were over 100 material errors and, inaccuracies in the Commission's SO. The Commission has already admitted that its own econometric analysis was inaccurate by a factor of 100".
"Many of the Commission's claims (which were transposed verbatim from the false claims made by the Irish
Department of Transport and Aer Lingus) are factually untrue", O'Leary said. [ 26-06-07 0922GMT ]

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission will block Irish low-cost airline  Ryanair's (RYA.DB)  bid for Irish flag carrier  Aer Lingus  (EIL1.DB) on Wednesday,  Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said at a press conference Tuesday. [ 26-06-07 0957GMT ]

The E.U.s decision serves solely the narrow interests of the Irish government, O'Leary said. The Irish government is Aer Lingus's  biggest shareholder, with a stake of around 25%.

O'Leary said the blocking of the takeover was politically motivated and designed to appease the Irish government. [ 26-06-07 1058GMT ]
The European Commission, however, rejected the idea it would bend to political pressure.
"The commission's obligation is to be completely impartial and objective," said competition spokesman Jonathan
Todd.
"All the commission's merger and acquisition decisions are open to challenge before the European Court of
Justice. It would make absolutely no sense to take a politically motivated decision," he said.

By Quentin Fottrell
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

DUBLIN (Dow Jones)-- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY) said Tuesday the European Union Wednesday will block its takeover of Irish state carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC (EIl1.DB), but added that it will launch an appeal to the European Court.

Europe's largest low-cost airline said that it condemns the E.U. Commission's yet-to-be-announced decision to thwart the bid as "unjustified." Ryanair said it will oppose any attempt to force it to sell its 25% stake in Aer Lingus.
EU competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said only that a decision on the deal would be made by July 4.

"This prohibition reverses 20 years of E.U. airline consolidation which has seen the Commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors," the company said in a statement ahead of a press conference in Brussels.

At a press conference in Brussels, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he is confident the European Court would overturn the European Commission's expected decision. Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion Tuesday rebuked O'Leary and vowed to keep Aer Lingus independent.

"Michael O'Leary has sought to take out his closest competitor and he has failed," Mannion said. "He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure."

Mannion added, "If the E.U. Commission announces a prohibition decision following its exhaustive investigation, it will represent another boost for Aer Lingus and for consumers."

Aer Lingus and the Irish government have argued that a combined entity would have a 70%-plus market share of domestic short-haul routes. Ryanair has lower average fares, while Aer Lingus pilots have higher wages.
In Brussels, O'Leary said he would fight on.

"This prohibition reverses 20 years of E.U. airline consolidation which has seen the Commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors including Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa/Austrian," O'Leary said.
"These airlines have bigger positions at their home airports than the combined Ryanair/ Aer Lingus share at
Dublin Airport," he said, adding that Air France and KLM have over 60% of movements at their respective hubs.

O'Leary said that the two airlines account for less than 5% of the E.U. air travel market and said the E.U.'s decision is designed "to appease the narrow interests of the Irish government."

The E.U.'s Todd said the Commission would not make its decision based on politics. "It would make absolutely no sense to take a politically motivated decision. We cannot do so, we would not do so and we will not do so."

Although Ryanair has already admitted that its hostile EUR2.80-a-share, EUR1.48 billion bid for Aer Lingus was unlikely to succeed due to shareholder opposition, it hasn't ruled out a future bid for the Irish-based carrier.

Page 83 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But Ryanair would need almost all the shares not held by Aer Lingus or its strategic allies. Last year, Aer Lingus' powerful Employee Share Ownership Trust - which has a 12.5% stake - voted 97% to reject Ryanair's hostile offer.

The Irish government owns 25% of Aer Lingus; Aer Lingus pilots 2.27% and Irish billionaire Denis O'Brien recently upped his stake to 2.3%. These holders are against the bid. Those shareholders opposed to Ryanair's bid hold nearly 43% of Aer Lingus' shares.

Both airlines serve the busy Dublin-London market, albeit to different airports around the U.K. capital. Aer Lingus also flies to European cities, but, unlike Ryanair, flies long-haul to Dubai and several U.S. cities.
At 1030 GMT, Aer Lingus' shares were down 2.7%, or 7 cents, at EUR2.50 on the Irish Stock Exchange, while
Ryanair was down 0.8%, or 4 cents, at EUR4.99. The ISEQ Overall Index was down 0.5% at 9340.
"The E.U.'s decision was expected, so I can't see why the Aer Lingus share price is even reacting," said Dolmen
Securities analyst Stuart Draper. "It's still a very low risk that Ryanair will be forced to sell its stake."

Ryanair's  Michael O'Leary slams 'nakedly  political' decison

Michael O'Leary has launched a scathing attack on EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes over the expected blocking of his airline's stalled €1.5bn (£1bn) takeover of Aer Lingus.  By David Gow in Brussels.

Michael O'Leary launched a scathing attack on  EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes today for her "nakedly political" decision to block  Ryanair's stalled &#8364;1.5bn (£1bn)  takeover of Aer Lingus.  Ms Kroes will confirm the ban tomorrow.

Getting his retaliation in first, Mr O'Leary accused Ms Kroes of kowtowing to the interests of Bertie Ahern, the Irish premier, whose government retains a 25% stake in the former state-owned Aer Lingus, and of being biased against Ryanair.

The commission, the chief executive added, had simply ignored the &#8364;100m in guaranteed savings the merger would give consumers. "It is quite clear that European consumers can't trust this commission. It supports mergers which result in higher fares and surcharges."

Jonathan Todd, Ms Kroes' spokesman, denied any bias. "The commission is under an obligation to be completely objective and impartial and any merger decisions are subject to challenge before the court of first instance so it would not make sense to for it to take a political decision."

Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus's chief executive, scoffed at the political jibe. "Michael O'Leary has sought to take out his closest competitor and he has failed. He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure."

Mr O'Leary said he would appeal the decision before the CFI, Europe's second-highest court, and if he won could "revisit" the lapsed bid for what he called a "second or even third division" and "loss-making regional European airline" no one else would touch. He vowed to hold on to his airline's 25% stake in Aer Lingus and sue the commission for any attempt to force it to sell it off.

He claimed the EC's "unprecedented" decision to ban a combined airline with a less than 5% EU market share contrasted with that to "rubber stamp" all other mergers between larger competitors such as Air France-KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss/Austrian with minimal "remedies".

The ever-combative Ryanair chief, who has clashed before with Brussels over his Belgian base at Charleroi, averred that Ms Kroes would on past form wave through potential mergers such as a takeover of Alitalia by Italy's Air One or a BA-led consortium's takeover of Iberia. But he also claimed that Ms Kroes's decision would block future airline consolidation.

The commission will block the all-Irish merger because it would give the combined airline more than 80% of the market for flights out of Dublin &mdash; compared with the 61% claimed by Mr O'Leary, who has offered to hand over Aer Lingus slots in Heathrow to BA and Air France and allow them to enter Dublin. "It's not in his gift to do so," Mr Mannion's aides said.

He claimed the EC's "unprecedented" decision to ban a combined airline with a less than 5% EU market share contrasted with that to "rubber stamp" all other mergers between larger competitors such as Air France-KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss/Austrian with minimal "remedies".

The ever-combative Ryanair chief, who has clashed before with Brussels over his Belgian base at Charleroi, averred that Ms Kroes would on past form wave through potential mergers such as a takeover of Alitalia by Italy's Air One or a BA-led consortium's takeover of Iberia. But he also claimed that Ms Kroes's decision would block future airline consolidation.

The commission will block the all-Irish merger because it would give the combined airline more than 80% of the market for flights out of Dublin &mdash; compared with the 61% claimed by Mr O'Leary, who has offered to hand over Aer Lingus slots in Heathrow to BA and Air France and allow them to enter Dublin. "It's not in his gift to do so," Mr Mannion's aides said.

Ryanair takes action ahead of EU decision

O'Leary to respond ahead of Brussels ruling to block Aer Lingustakeover bid tomorrow

RYANAIR is planning to 'get its spake in first' by slamming the  European Commission decision to block its
takeover of Aer Lingus  before the decision has even been announced.

Widely-leaked information has confirmed the EC will shoot down the €1.4bn merger tomorrow morning, ahead of a decision deadline on July 4.

In a pre-emptive strike, Ryanair will today hold a press conference in Brussels lambasting the decision and outlining the airline's response.

"It's a case of getting our spake in before they do," as one senior Ryanair executive put it. The airline has previously said it will mount a legal challenge if the EC moves to block the deal; full details of this are expected to be disclosed tomorrow.
The Ryanair executive added the airline "understood" the Commission would come out with a decision on
Wednesday but had received no formal indication to that effect.
Senior sources at Aer Lingus confirmed that they too were expecting a decision "around mid-morning on
Wednesday", but that no formal communication had been issued.

When the EC blocks the deal, it will mark the first time the Commission has blocked a merger between two major airlines, with Air France/KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss/SAS among those to have already benefited from the EC's previous pro-consolidation policies.

However, the Ryanair/ Aer Lingus merger is the first one that was not backed by both parties, with Aer Lingus management vehemently opposing any deal.
A document leaked earlier in the EC review process showed that the Commission's primary concerns centred on
Ryanair/ Aer Lingus' excessive dominance in the Irish market place.

Ryanair had proposed a number of remedies to the EC's concerns, chief executive Michael O'Leary told investors earlier this month.
"We have offered to reduce Aer Lingus fares by €100m per annum; we have offered to transfer Aer Lingus slots in
Heathrow to BA or Air France; we have offered to hand over a significant percentage of Dublin slots to base up to
10 aircraft there - no matter what we offer, it appears that the EC is uninterested," he said.

The EC's rebuttal of the deal will give considerable relief to the national carrier, which has been existing under the shadow of the Ryanair bid for almost its entire life as a quoted company.
The company's cost cutting plans, due to come into force on August 1, will also get a fresh injection of life as the
Ryanair bid is cleared from the horizons.

However, management may find it harder to push through changes in the absence of the unspoken threat of 'do it our way now, or do it Michael O'Leary's way in a few months time'.

If the EC's moves to force Ryanair to sell some or all of its 25.2pc stake in Aer Lingus, the airline's share price could also be in for an interesting time.

Just 35pc of the stock is in free float at the moment, with the remainder held by Ryanair and parties opposing the
Ryanair bid.
These includre the Government, Aer Lingus pilots, Aer Lingus unions and telecoms billionaire Denis O'Brien. The airline's price has fluctuated erratically of late, largely due to the tiny volumes traded .
But if 25.2pc of the stock re-entered the market and Ryanair's offer price of €2.80 a share was taken off the table, the stock now at €2.57 could be in for a more turbulent ride.

EU to block Ryanair’s  Aer Lingusbid
424 words
26 June 2007

RYANAIR will come out fighting today to keep its  bid for Aer Lingus  alive as the European Commission prepares to block the  takeover on competition grounds.

The EU’s competition directorate studied the impact of the proposed €1.48 billion  takeover for more than six months and are tomorrow expected to halt the  deal as it would give the combined group a dominant position at Dublin Airport.

But Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary is in Brussels today where he is expected to announce he will fight the decision in the European courts if the EU rejects the takeover.
According to a leaked report of the commission’s decision, it will also take the unusual step of trying to force
Ryanair to sell its 25% stake in Aer Lingus.

The move by the commission to block the proposed takeover, which is unlikely to proceed given the opposition of the Government and the Aer Lingus workforce, is highly unusual. It has blocked just 20 mergers since 1990 and only one since 2004.
The commission, however, laid the groundwork to force Ryanair to cut or sell all of that holding.

Both airlines are based at Dublin Airport and serve a market where few others have shown an interest in establishing a base.

The EU regulator in March issued a charge sheet, (a statement of objections), that laid out a tough case against the merger. Ryanair’s cut-rate prices and expanding choice of destinations have forced Aer Lingus to transform from a staid, high-priced carrier into a competitor ready to match Mr O’Leary ticket for ticket and route for route.
The charge sheet said in the past six years the number of routes on which the carriers competed had jumped to
37 from eight, driving prices down by 5%-8%. Ryanair offered proposals it said could ensure competition, but they
were never enough to satisfy the commission. For example, it offered to make space for a new rival to base as
many as six planes at Dublin Airport.

Ryanair also offered to sell Aer Lingus’s slots at Heathrow and Dublin for flights between the two airports. It will argue the tie-up should be cleared as the EU has already approved a merger between Air France and KLM.

On the issue of the EU forcing Ryanair to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus, the budget carrier believes this can only happen if it can be proved it exercises some influence over its rival.

Ryanair boss hits at takeover decision

Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary today criticised an expected  European Commission decision to stop his low-cost airline taking over Ireland’s national carrier  Aer Lingus.

The attack came amid growing speculation that the ban will be announced by Brussels tomorrow or next week – the first time for 20 years that the Commission’s competition authorities will have blocked a  European airline merger.
Mr O’Leary, speaking in Brussels, said there was no justification for the "unprecedented" decision.

He said: "This is designed to appeal solely to the narrow vested interests of the Irish Government and ignore the benefits to millions of consumers."

Ryanair’s £1bn (€1.48bn) offer for Aer Lingus immediately attracted a formal Commission monopolies inquiry amid concern about the development of a single dominant air carrier operating at Dublin Airport and stifling competition.
Mr O’Leary pointed out today that the proposed takeover affected less than 5% of the European airline market. And he insisted he had already guaranteed massive savings for passengers of about £70m (€104m) per year in
lower fares and fuel surcharges.

He said if the Commission does announce a block on the takeover, " Aer Lingus passengers should send the bill for their higher fares and fuel surcharges to the European Commission in Brussels".

Mr O’Leary declared: "The Commission’s decision to prohibit this merger between two EU airlines which between them represent just 5% of European airline traffic is not just unprecedented but, in our view, unlawful.

"We call on the Commission to explain how it can rubber-stamp mergers between larger airlines such as Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa/Austrian, when these airlines have bigger positions at their home airports than the combined Ryanair/ Aer Lingus share at Dublin Airport."

Mr O’Leary said the Air France/KLM merger had resulted in significant fare increases – but Ryanair has offered unprecedented reductions which, he said, were guaranteed.
He accused the Commission of targeting Ryanair with a "unique" set of rules which did not mirror the
Commission’s approach to airline takeover cases for the last 20 years.
Apart from Aer Lingus, only the Irish Government raised objections to the proposed merger, and last March the
Commission set out a "statement of objections" against the move.

Final confirmation that the deal will not be permitted is bound to raise the stakes in the lengthy difficult relationship between Mr O’Leary and EU competition officials.

Today Ryanair claimed any ban was based on an inaccurate analysis of the effects on European airline competition and the competitive position of Dublin Airport.

A Ryanair statement said Brussels was wrong to claim that competing airlines would not enter Dublin Airport if Ryanair took over Aer Lingus – "the case file proves that other competitors have confirmed they will enter Dublin Airport," said the statement.
The low-cost carrier owns 25% of Aer Lingus and, once the takeover ban is announced, intends to appeal to
European judges in Luxembourg.
"The court has overturned several Commission prohibitions and we expect it will do so again in this case," said Mr
O’Leary.
"European consumers should not be denied the lower fare and fuel surcharge savings which will follow from a
Ryanair/ Aer Lingus merger.

"We are confident that the European Court will overturn this bizarre, illogical, manifestly inaccurate and untenable prohibition."

UPDATE 2-Ryanair boss slams EUAer Lingus  veto as political
By David Lawsky and Darren Ennis
640 words
26 June 2007

(Adds Aer Lingus  and EU reaction, share price, details)

BRUSSELS, June 26 (Reuters) - Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary on Tuesday attacked  EU plans to veto its hostile  bid to take over Irish rival Aer Lingus,  calling the move politically motivated to appease Dublin.

The European Commission intends to block the approach by Europe's biggest budget airline on Wednesday, sources familiar with the issue have said.

O'Leary's comments revived a nine-month war of words with Aer Lingus which has strenuously defended itself against a takeover ever since Ryanair's approach last October.
"Michael O'Leary has sought to 'take out' his closest competitor and he has failed," Aer Lingus Chief Executive
Dermot Mannion said in a statement. "He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure."
O'Leary repeated on Tuesday that he would appeal against the expected bid veto by going to the EU's Court of
First Instance.

"This decision is politically motivated, designed to appease the narrow interests of the Irish government, which was the only party -- other than Aer Lingus itself -- to object to the merger," O'Leary told reporters.

"The decision is manifestly in error since it is based on the Commission's inaccurate claim that there are barriers to entry at Dublin Airport," he said.

The European Commission responded by saying it was obliged to be "completely impartial and objective" and pointed out that all its merger decisions could be challenged in EU courts.

"This is the first time that we have been looking at a proposed merger where the two airlines operate out of the same home base airport," European Commission's spokesman for competition Jonathan Todd told reporters.

Shares in Ryanair were 1.2 percent weaker at 4.97 euros by 1047 GMT, compared with a 0.6 percent fall on the broader Irish market. Thinly traded Aer Lingus shares were down 2.7 percent at 2.50 euros.
"INDEPENDENT COMPANY"

Ryanair's 1.48 billion euro ($1.97 billion) approach for the former state carrier lapsed automatically in December when authorities decided to conduct the in-depth investigation, but the company has said it intends to return with a second offer.

The bid came shortly after Aer Lingus's stock market debut last year but faced big hurdles from the start amid opposition from key shareholders, including the Irish state which is Aer Lingus's biggest shareholder with just over
25 percent.

Recently re-elected Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has said the government's stake is strategic and he will never sell it.

O'Leary said he would "oppose any attempt" by the Commission force a disposal of its 25 percent stake, adding that such a move would lead to a "collapse" in the Aer Lingus share price.


Page 93 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission has laid the groundwork to force Ryanair to cut or sell its holding and will decide later whether to do so.
Aer Lingus said a blocking of Ryanair's bid would be a "boost" for both the company and its customers.

"We have made tremendous strides over a relatively short time in successfully executing our strategy and look forward to making even more progress in the coming months," Mannion said. "The environment is competitive and we will continue to fight to deliver on our excellent prospects as an independent company."

Ryanair offered proposals in the past it said would ensure competition, but they were not enough to satisfy the Commission. Among them were an offer to sell Aer Lingus's slots at London's Heathrow and Dublin for flights between the two airports.

'We are confident that the European Court will overturn this bizarre, illogical, manifestly inaccurate and untenable prohibition.''
Mr O'Leary said he was confident that European judges would overturn the Commission banning order once the
Commission's 'flaky'' arguments were exposed.
He said: 'Any independent-minded judge is going to say 'why the hell can Air France, with 60% of air traffic at
Paris Charles De Gaulle airport, acquire KLM when Ryanair cannot merge with Aer Lingus, when they only have
5% of the market'?

'We have made a stunning offer guaranteeing lower fares for consumers, we know that other substantial airlines, including British Airways and Air France, are ready to open bases at Dublin airport, and there is no reason why this takeover should not go ahead.''

Apart from anything else, he added, no one else was prepared to take over Aer Lingus, a 'loss-making marginal airline''.

He said it was obvious that the current European Commission was biased against Ryanair - a commission which, Mr O'Leary claimed, 'could not roll over fast enough'' to approve mergers between bigger carriers.

Mr O'Leary said a question mark will hang over all future EU airline mergers if the Ryanair/ Aer Lingus case is rejected.
It is natural that Aer Lingus would object to Ryanair's approaches, he added, but it is surprising that the Irish
Government would raise objections to a deal which would provide lower fares for consumers using Dublin airport.

(reopens) When the Commission first challenged the Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus, Mr O'Leary responded with a commitment guaranteeing reduced air fares under a merged Irish airline - and offered to pay any shortfall back to Aer Lingus passengers or, in the form of a fine, to the Commission.

''We have promised that we will cut fares when Ryanair merges with Aer Lingus and I have made it quite clear that if we fail to do so, we will make up the difference by reimbursing every single Aer Lingus passenger - that's
8.5 million a year - or pay a fine to the Commission, which they can do with as they wish. Waste it, probably.''

Mr O'Leary added: 'We have said we will be audited by one of the big accounting firms so that the Commission can see that we are meeting our commitment to cut fares.''

The fact that such an offer was being rejected was part of a 'crazy'' Commission response to a relatively minor airline merger, he said, adding: 'Everything to do with this decision is crazy.''

Mr O'Leary said the controversy surrounding the Commission's decision and Ryanair's response had already led to a dramatic fall in the Aer Lingus share price, down from 3 euro to 2.39 euro during the Ryanair press conference today.

Ryanair Holdings PLC - EU TO BLOCK A LINGUS TAKEOVER

EU COMMISSION TO BLOCK AER LINGUSTAKEOVER
EUROPEAN CONSUMERS DENIED €100m P.A. IN LOWER FARES BY THE EU

Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday 26 June) held a Press Conference in Brussels to respond to the recent European Commission leaks indicating that Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus will be prohibited. Ryanair expects this prohibition decision to be announced by DG Competition over the coming week.
Ryanair condemned this prohibition decision on a number of grounds as follows:

1. This prohibition reverses 20 years of EU airline consolidation which has seen the Commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors including Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa/Austrian, all with minimal remedies.
2. This prohibition is unjustified in the case of two airlines which between them account for less than 5% of the EU
air travel market.

3. The decision is politically motivated, designed to appease the narrow interests of the Irish Government, which was the only party (other than Aer Lingus itself) to object to the merger.

4. This decision is bad for consumers, because it allows Aer Lingus to continue to increase its fares and levy unjustified fuel surcharges, both of which would have been reduced/eliminated had the Ryanair merger succeeded.
5. The decision is manifestly erroneous as it applys a citypair analysis (e.g.

claiming that
Aer Lingus flights to Heathrow and Charles de Gaulle compete
with Ryanair flights to Stansted and Beauvais) when every other EU airline merger precedents have applied an airport pair analysis (under which rules typically Heathrow and Charles de Gaulle would be deemed to be separate markets from Stansted and Beauvais respectively).
6. The decision is manifestly in error since it is based on the Commission's inaccurate claim that there are barriers to entry at Dublin Airport, when
the case file evidence clearly proves that there are no barriers to entry at
Dublin Airport.
7. The decision inaccurately claims that other competitors would not enter Dublin Airport, when the case file proves that other competitors have confirmed they will enter Dublin Airport.
8. The decision is based on applying a "base" competition concept which has no precedent and is a misapplication of 25 year old US cases.
9. The Commission wrongly claims that  Aer Lingus has a record of entering routes where Ryanair operates. In fact the opposite is the case. Aer Lingus has withdrawn from over 20 Ryanair routes in the past 7 years.



Page 98 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The decision ignores the substantial consumer benefits of over €100m p.a. guaranteed by Ryanair's remedies package which included:

1. Reducing Aer Lingus's short-haul fares by 10% p.a. (saving consumers over €70m p.a.). 2. Immediately eliminating Aer Lingus's fuel surcharges (saving consumers over €30m p.a.). 3. Transferring Heathrow slots to BA and Air France, who will each base aircraft in Dublin. 4. Transferring Dublin slots to other competitors, as long as they based between 6 to 10 new aircraft in Dublin (a total of over 2,800 weekly slots).

This prohibition will make further European airline consolidation more difficult to proceed including for example the rumoured takeover of Alitalia by Air One, and the rumoured acquisition of Iberia by a British Airways led consortium. At a time when European airlines are facing renewed competition from American mega carriers under EU-US Open Skies, this prohibition reverses the Commission's 20 year policy of encouraging EU airline consolidation, denies Aer Lingus passengers a guarantee of lower fares and zero fuel surcharges, and shows the Commission's lack of impartiality or balance in cases which conflict with the narrow vested interests of national governments.
Speaking at today's press conference in Brussels, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:

"The European Commission's decision to prohibit this merger between two EU airlines which between them represent just 5% of European airline traffic is not just unprecedented, but in our view unlawful.

"We call on the Commission to explain how it can rubber stamp mergers between larger airlines such as
Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and
Lufthansa/Austrian, when these airlines have bigger positions at their home airports than the combined Ryanair/ Aer Lingus share at Dublin Airport. When Air France which has over 60% share of aircraft movements at Paris CDG is allowed by the Commission (with minimal remedies) to acquire KLM which has over 60% share of movements at Schipol, it is untenable that the Commission now changes these rules, to prohibit a Ryanair/ Aer Lingus merger which will result in a similar 60% share of movements at only one airport Dublin which is currently doubling its capacity. Whereas the Air France/KLM merger, resulted in significant fare increases, Ryanair has offered unprecedented remedies which include over €100m p.a. of guaranteed fare and fuel surcharge reductions. It is obvious that the Commission is applying a unique and unprecedented set of rules in the Ryanair/ Aer Lingus case.
"The Commission's case as set out in its Statement of Objections is materially inaccurate. There were over 100 material errors and, inaccuracies in the Commission's SO. The Commission has already admitted that its own econometric analysis was inaccurate by a factor of 100. Many of the Commission's claims (which were transposed verbatim from the false claims made by the Irish Department of Transport and  Aer Lingus) are factually untrue.
" Air Berlin recently completed the acquisition of Deutsche BA and LTU in Germany. Both of these takeovers were approved by the German Competition Authority with minimal remedies, despite the fact that they led to higher fares and fuel surcharges for DBA and LTU passengers. Similarly Flybe has recently acquired BA Connect from  British Airways under a merger whereby
British Airways acquired a 15% stake in Flybe, the UK's second largest low fares airline. Yet again the UK Office of Fair Trading approved this merger with very minimal remedies. It is surprising that the only airline merger in Europe over the past 20 years which has been prohibited is this proposed Ryanair/ Aer Lingus takeover. The only difference with this merger is the opposition of the Irish Government and one can only conclude that the European Commission's decision to prohibit is a political one to appease the
Irish Government rather than advance the interests of Aer Lingus's consumers and European competitiveness generally.
Ryanair, which currently owns just 25% of  Aer Lingus, will appeal this prohibition to the European Court of First Instance, and seek to have it overturned. The Court has overturned several Commission prohibitions and we expect the Court will do so again in this case. European consumers should not be denied the lower fare and fuel surcharge savings which will follow

from a Ryanair/ Aer Lingus merger. Ryanair calls on the European Commission to explain how it can rubber stamp Air France's and Lufthansa's acquisitions, as well as all other EU airline mergers over the past 20 years, yet now prohibit a merger between two Irish airlines which combined account for less than 5% of EU airline traffic. We are confident that the
European Courts will overturn this bizarre, illogical, manifestly inaccurate and untenable prohibition.
Ryanair also confirmed that it will oppose any attempt by the European Commission to require it to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair highlighted that it owns just 25% of  Aer Lingus, and has no control over Aer Lingus which remains controlled and run by the Irish Government and its
trade unions. Ryanair highlighted that in recent months it has called upon
Aer Lingus to lower its airfares - yet  Aer Lingus has raised them. Ryanair has also called on  Aer Lingus to remove its unjustified fuel surcharges -
yet again Aer Lingus has since raised them. The fact that Aer Lingus's share price has now fallen to €2.50, some 30 cents below the Ryanair offer of
€2.80 per share suggests that the Board and management of Aer Lingus are putting the interests of its major shareholder, the Irish Government, over the interests of other Aer Lingus shareholders who should be entitled to accept Ryanair's offer and this is a very worrying development for ordinary
Aer Lingus shareholders.
Aer Lingus fares last year were more than twice those of Ryanair, and rising. Aer Lingus passengers continue to suffer high fuel surcharges whereas Ryanair guarantees "no fuel surcharges". With this decision, Aer
Lingus' high fares and fuel surcharges will continue. Aer Lingus' passengers should send the bill for their higher fares and fuel surcharges to the European Commission, rue de la Loi 200, Brussels!".

Editor's Note:
Finally, Ryanair welcomed the confirmation of the EU Ombudsman that he will investigate a series of leaks by the EU Commission in this case and its failure to take any action against  Aer Lingus for leaking/publishing details of Ryanair's confidential remedies to the markets.

The European Commission will block Irish low-cost airline  Ryanair Holdings PLC's  bid for Irish flag carrier  Aer    Lingus  Group PLC today,  Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said. The decision by the  European Union's executive body serves solely the narrow interests of the Irish government, Mr. O'Leary said. The Irish government is Aer Lingus's  biggest shareholder, with a stake of around 25%. "The commission's obligation is to be
completely impartial and objective,"  EU competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said.  Aer Lingus  CEO Dermot Mannion rebuked Mr. O'Leary and vowed to keep  Aer Lingus  independent. "Michael O'Leary has sought to take out his closest competitor, and he has failed," Mr. Mannion said. "He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure."

EU Blocks  Ryanair From Buying  Irish Peer Aer Lingus

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday blocked low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC's (RYA.DB) from  buying  its Irish peer  Aer Lingus  PLC (EIL1.DB), saying that such a merger would have led to a quasi monopoly in the Irish markets.

The block is the first in two decades of the commission's drive to consolidate  European airtravel, where several larger deals have been passed.

By combining the two leading airlines operating from Ireland "the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties," the commission said in a press release.

Ryanair has made it clear that it will appeal the decision in the European Court, with O'Leary saying Tuesday that any commission's block on the bid was "unjustified" and "fundamentally flawed."

"This prohibition reverses 20 years of E.U. airline consolidation which has seen the commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors," the company said in a statement Tuesday.

Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said that the commission's decision to block the takeover was politically motivated with the Irish government being the only other opponent to the deal in addition to Aer Lingus. He accused the commission of disregarding some of the evidence and remedies Ryanair had offered to support their bid "solely to appeal to the narrow interests of the Irish government."

"Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport," said antitrust official Neelie Kroes in the press release. A concentration of this magnitude would have "most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 million E.U. passengers using these routes to and from Ireland each year," the commission said.

Ryanair had promised to cut Aer Lingus fares and completely remove their fuel surcharges, which would have resulted in EUR100 million per annum saves for consumers, Ryanair's O'leary said.

Remedies offered by Ryanair "were inadequate to remove the competition concerns," the commission said. In particular, the commission said that the limited number of airport "slots" offered by Ryanair wasn't enough to ensure that sufficient competition would continue on the Irish markets
Ryanair had offered to sell six to 10 Dublin based airport slots and find an upfront buyer such as Easyjet, said
O'Leary.

The commission forced Air France SA (3112.FR) and Dutch carrier KLM to give up takeoff and landing slots at their Amsterdam and Paris hubs when they merged in 2004.
Germany's Lufthansa AG (LHA.XE) and Swiss Air were also required to give up slots when they merged last year. But even without the antitrust clearance, Ryanair's takeover plans looked shaky. Ryanair holds 25% of Aer Lingus
shares, but shareholders with about 46% remain opposed to the bid. The Irish government, has a 25% stake in
the carrier.

The Ryanair- Aer Lingus merger was the first time the commission had to assess a merger of two main airlines in a single country operating from the same "home" airport, which made the case different from previous airline mergers, the commission said.


Page 102 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Aer Lingus and the Irish government have argued that a combined entity would have a 70%-plus market share of domestic short-haul routes. Ryanair has lower average fares, while Aer Lingus pilots have higher wages.

Both airlines serve the busy Dublin-London market, albeit to different airports around the U.K. capital. Aer Lingus also flies to European cities, but, unlike Ryanair, flies long-haul to Dubai and several U.S. cities.
Aer Lingus is the former Irish "flag"-carrier, which has changed its business model in recent years to offer mainly
"low-cost" short-haul flights. It operates more than 80 routes and carried more than 8.6 million passengers in
2006.

Ryanair is a considerably larger "low-cost" airline, having carried 42 million passengers in 2006 and offering services on more than 400 routes across Europe.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission can't force a  sale of Ryanair's stock in Aer Lingus,  the commission's antitrust official Neelie Kroes said in a press briefing Wednesday. [ 06-27-07 0549ET ]

Kroes also said she was confident that the decision to block  Ryanair's hostile  takeover bid for Aer Lingus  "is legally sound and will bear the scrutiny of the Court of First Instance, should it be appealed."
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Tuesday that he planned to appeal the decision in the European
Court.

The takeover bid was blocked because there was an "unprecedented number of routes where competition would have been harmed" and that would have been "unacceptable" to 14 million passengers currently flying on 35 routes to and from Ireland, Kroes said.

The move to block Ryanair's takeover bid was only the second time the commission had moved to block a merger since Kroes became antitrust commissioner in 2004, she said.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday blocked low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC's (RYA.DB) from buying its Irish peer Aer Lingus PLC (EIL1.DB), saying that such a merger would have led to a quasi monopoly in the Irish markets.

The block is the first in two decades of the commission's drive to consolidate European airtravel, where several larger deals have been passed. It is only the second merger case blocked during antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes's tenure and only the 20th out of the 3,500 cases reviewed since 1990.

The deal was effectively dead anyway, because Ryanair had failed to garner enough backing among Aer Lingus shareholders for the bid to go through, but the E.U.'s decision means Ryanair is unlikely to make a fresh offer for the Irish national carrier in the future.

By combining the two leading airlines operating from Ireland "the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties," the commission said in a press release.

It would also have given the combined company 80% share of all flights to and from Dublin airport, effectively making new entries to the market very difficult, the commission said.

Ryanair has made it clear that it will appeal the decision in the European Court, with Chief Executive Michael O'Leary saying Tuesday that any commission's block on the bid was "unjustified" and "fundamentally flawed." In a new statement Wednesday, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier called the decision unlawful and said it is confident that the European Court of First Instance will overturn the Commission decision.

"This prohibition reverses 20 years of E.U. airline consolidation which has seen the commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors," the company said in a statement Tuesday.
This leaves Aer Lingus struggling as a third-tier, loss-making regional carrier," O'Leary said at a press conference
Wednesday.

The Commission countered that it is confident that the decision to block Ryanair's hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus "is legally sound and will bear the scrutiny of the Court of First Instance, should it be appealed," said Kroes in a press briefing.
Aer Lingus Chairman John Sharman welcomed the decision saying it was good news for competition. "Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of
Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers," he said. " Aer Lingus
already competes successfully with Ryanair across many routes and will continue to do so in the interests of all
consumers."
He said the E.U. had carried out an "exhaustive" investigation.

O'Leary said that the commission's decision to block the takeover was politically motivated with the Irish government being the only other opponent to the deal in addition to Aer Lingus.

shares, but shareholders with about 46% remain opposed to the bid. The Irish government has a 25% stake in
the carrier. Ryanair's stake in the company seems stable for the moment as the European Commission can't
force a sale of Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus under merger regulation, Kroes said.

However there are other ways to make Ryanair give up its stake, said a person familiar with the matter. "Kroes made very clear she was talking about the merger regulation only," the person said. The commission can still refer the case to the Irish national regulator which probably has a lower threshold or review the case under broader competition regulation saying that the stake harms the competitive relationship.
Ryanair has said it wants to remain a long-term Aer Lingus shareholder even if the E.U. blocked its bid.

The Ryanair- Aer Lingus merger was the first time the commission had to assess a merger of two main airlines in a single country operating from the same "home" airport, which made the case different from previous airline mergers, the commission said.

EUR2.60.

2nd UPDATE: EU Blocks  Ryanair From BuyingAer Lingus

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday blocked low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.DB) from buying its Irish peer Aer Lingus PLC (EIL1.DB), saying such a merger would have led to a
quasi-monopoly in the Irish markets.

The block is the first in two decades of the commission's drive to consolidate European air travel, where several larger deals have been passed. It is only the second merger case blocked during antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes's tenure and only the 20th out of the 3,500 cases reviewed since 1990.

The deal was effectively dead anyway, because Ryanair had failed to garner enough backing among Aer Lingus shareholders for the bid to go through, but the E.U.'s decision means Ryanair will find it difficult to make a fresh offer for the Irish national carrier in the future.

However, it seems that Ryanair hasn't thrown in the towel yet and the company has said it will appeal the decision, calling the commission ruling "fundamentally flawed" and "unlawful".
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the E.U. approval was only ever part of a long-term strategy to cut
E.U. red tape. If the courts overturn the E.U. ruling, a future bid "may or may not arise ... or we may just sit on our
25% stake and nurse our losses," O'Leary said.

"The problem with Aer Lingus is that it's cost base is too high and its fares are too high," O'Leary said. "The difficulty now is we can't even make another offer because we haven't got through the regulatory process."
In a statement Wednesday, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier said it is confident that the European Court of First
Instance will overturn the Commission decision.

The commission said the case of Ryanair/ Aer Lingus was different from other airline cases it had approved in the past, as both airlines were based in Ireland and sharing Dublin as their 'home' port.

By combining the two leading airlines operating from Ireland "the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties," the commission said in a press release.

It would also have given the combined company 80% share of all flights to and from Dublin airport, effectively making new entries to the market very difficult, the commission said.

"This prohibition reverses 20 years of E.U. airline consolidation which has seen the commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors," the company said in a statement Tuesday.

only other opponent to the deal in addition to Aer Lingus. He accused the commission of disregarding some of the
evidence and remedies Ryanair had offered to support their bid "solely to appeal to the narrow interests of the
Irish government."

The commission said consumer choice was the core point considered by the commission. Their decision to stop the merger was "essential to safeguard Irish consumers," who depend heavily on air travel, Kroes said. A concentration of this magnitude would have "led to higher prices for more than 14 million E.U. passengers using these routes to and from Ireland each year," the commission said.

Ryanair had promised to cut Aer Lingus fares and completely remove their fuel surcharges, which would have resulted in EUR100 million per annum saves for consumers.

But the commission said the EUR100 million savings on Aer Lingus ticket costs would have been valid only for a year, while nothing was said about the cost of Ryanair ticket prices.

Remedies offered by Ryanair "were inadequate to remove the competition concerns," the commission said. In particular, the limited number of airport "slots" offered by Ryanair wasn't enough to ensure the continuation of sufficient competition on the Irish markets, the commission said.
Ryanair had offered to sell six to 10 Dublin based airport slots and find an upfront buyer such as Easyjet, said
O'Leary.

The commission forced Air France SA (3112.FR) and Dutch carrier KLM to give up takeoff and landing slots at their Amsterdam and Paris hubs when they merged in 2004.
Germany's Lufthansa AG (LHA.XE) and Swiss Air were also required to give up slots when they merged last year. Building up to the bid Ryanair had amassed a 25% stake in Aer Lingus shares, giving the company some sway
over Aer Lingus affairs. However, O'Leary said: "The only thing we'd be able to block at Aer Lingus is a takeover
bid".
Ryanair's stake in the company seems stable for the moment as the European Commission can't force a sale of
Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus under merger regulation, Kroes said.

EU blocks  Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus  on monopoly concerns

BY AOIFE WHITE AP

The Canadian Press

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _  EU regulators blocked a hostile  takeover bid by low-fare carrier Ryanair for
Ireland's  Aer Lingus  on Wednesday, saying it would limit consumer choice and likely boost ticket prices.

Together, the two Irish airlines would control more than 80 per cent of all  European flights to and from Dublin airport, the  European Commission said.
``What we are doing is preventing a monopoly from emerging,'' EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.
``Ireland, being an island, depends heavily on air transport.''
It is only the second time the EU has blocked a takeover bid since 2001.
The 1.48 billion euros (US$1.9 billion) takeover already appeared doomed after nearly half of Aer Lingus Group
PLC shareholders vowed to block it.

Ryanair believes the EU decision is politically motivated and aimed to please the Irish government. The government and Ryanair each control about a quarter of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair vowed to take regulators to court, citing earlier EU decisions to allow the combination of Air France and
KLM and of Lufthansa and Swissair.

Regulators, however, say the Ryanair bid was unprecedented because both airlines have such a large share of routes at one airport, Dublin. In previous takeovers, the airlines' main hubs were in different cities.

Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete directly on 35 routes to and from Ireland, regulators said, and the combination would give the combined carrier a monopoly on 22.

``This would have reduced choice and, most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 million EU passengers using these routes to and from Ireland each year,'' the European Commission said.
Changes offered by Ryanair to soothe EU concerns were inadequate, it said.

Regulators said the limited number of airport landing slots the airline offered to give away to new rivals would not replace the competitive pressure in the market that would disappear if Ryanair swallowed Aer Lingus.

``What is certain is that Ryanair proposed to end the intense competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus at Dublin airport that has pushed prices down and brought Irish consumers an increasing choice of direct flight connections from Dublin,'' it said.

``It is highly unlikely that Irish consumers would be better off with a near monopoly, even if it were sweetened by a temporary, hard-to-monitor price rebate.''
Aer Lingus chairman John Sharman said the EU decision was good news for the company and travellers.

``The creation of one dominant player out of Ireland _ despite the protestations of Ryanair _ just cannot be in the interests of consumers,'' he said.

But Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said Aer Lingus and its passengers were the real losers as the company's share price sinks far below the 2.80 euros ($3.77) a share that Ryanair had offered. He had also

Page 110 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
promised 100 million euros ($134.6 million) in savings for Aer Lingus customers through reduced fares and scrapped fuel surcharges.
Aer Lingus shares fell to 2.55 euros ($3.43) Wednesday.

``This prohibition leaves Aer Lingus exposed as a small, peripheral loss-making regional airline which cannot compete with Ryanair on price or punctuality from Dublin at a time when the rest of the European industry is consolidating,'' the company said.

O'Leary acknowledged his bid, suspended since December, was now ``officially dead,'' and that Ryanair was legally barred from making a new bid until a court rules on an appeal. That could take 18 to 24 months to be heard.

Growing rapidly from its Irish base into Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Ryanair has revolutionized travel in Europe, spearheading no-frills cheap flights that forced Aer Lingus _ a former state-owned airline _ to do the same.

EU blocks  Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus  on monopoly concerns

S & P code for assoc. stock..: E:AERL

The EU Commission has blocked a 1.48 billion bid by Ryanair to take over rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus saying the lack of competition would lead to higher ticket prices.

The budget Ryanair (RYA) would have assumed a monopoly on 22 routes and a 60%-plus market share on 13 others affecting a total of more than 14 million passengers, the commission said.
Both carriers account for about 80% of the airline passenger traffic in and out of Dublin, the report said.

Ryanair built up a one-quarter interest in Aer Lingus (AERL) stock before the bid last December, but cannot be made to sell its stake, the head of the commission told reporters in Brussels.

The commission said other carriers would be unlikely to compete against a merged Ryanair and Aer Lingus because of their superior market share and Ryanair's history of retaliation against competitors.

'This is not only because the merged entity would be able to operate from the very large bases of Ryanair and Aer Lingus in Irelandbut because Ryanair has a reputation of aggressive retaliation against any entry attempt by competitors,' it said.

It was the first time the commission had blocked an aviation merger and only the 20th time overall in 3,000 cases since 1990.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said yesterday he expected the verdict, accused the commission of repeatedly leaking sensitive information and had launched a formal complaint to the EU ombudsman.

O'Leary also plans to appeal the commission's ruling to the European Court of Instance. His case is that the combined carriers' share of Dublin traffic is similar to other merged airlines in their home markets.

Also, it represents less than 5% of European traffic and would save 200 million for the airlines and 100 million for passengers by lowering fares and eliminating fuel surcharges, he says.
Aer Lingus chairman John Sharman said the ruling was good for competition.
'Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of
Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interest of consumers,' Sharman said.
Shares in Ryanair nosed up 0.0425p to 5.0125p in London for a market value of 7.7 billion. Aer Lingus dipped 0.0687p to 2.5763p in London valuing the company at 1.375 billion. Document CWIRE00020070704e36r0001v

EU Blocks  Ryanair From Buying  Irish Peer Aer Lingus

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday blocked low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC's (RYA.DB) from  buying  its Irish peer  Aer Lingus  PLC (EIL1.DB), saying that such a merger would have led to a quasi monopoly in the Irish markets.

The block is the first in two decades of the commission's drive to consolidate  European airtravel, where several larger deals have been passed.

By combining the two leading airlines operating from Ireland "the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties," the commission said in a press release.

Ryanair has made it clear that it will appeal the decision in the European Court, with O'Leary saying Tuesday that any commission's block on the bid was "unjustified" and "fundamentally flawed."

"This prohibition reverses 20 years of E.U. airline consolidation which has seen the commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors," the company said in a statement Tuesday.

Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said that the commission's decision to block the takeover was politically motivated with the Irish government being the only other opponent to the deal in addition to Aer Lingus. He accused the commission of disregarding some of the evidence and remedies Ryanair had offered to support their bid "solely to appeal to the narrow interests of the Irish government."

"Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport," said antitrust official Neelie Kroes in the press release. A concentration of this magnitude would have "most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 million E.U. passengers using these routes to and from Ireland each year," the commission said.

Ryanair had promised to cut Aer Lingus fares and completely remove their fuel surcharges, which would have resulted in EUR100 million per annum saves for consumers, Ryanair's O'leary said.

Remedies offered by Ryanair "were inadequate to remove the competition concerns," the commission said. In particular, the commission said that the limited number of airport "slots" offered by Ryanair wasn't enough to ensure that sufficient competition would continue on the Irish markets
Ryanair had offered to sell six to 10 Dublin based airport slots and find an upfront buyer such as Easyjet, said
O'Leary.

The commission forced Air France SA (3112.FR) and Dutch carrier KLM to give up takeoff and landing slots at their Amsterdam and Paris hubs when they merged in 2004.
Germany's Lufthansa AG (LHA.XE) and Swiss Air were also required to give up slots when they merged last year. But even without the antitrust clearance, Ryanair's takeover plans looked shaky. Ryanair holds 25% of Aer Lingus
shares, but shareholders with about 46% remain opposed to the bid. The Irish government, has a 25% stake in
the carrier.

The Ryanair- Aer Lingus merger was the first time the commission had to assess a merger of two main airlines in a single country operating from the same "home" airport, which made the case different from previous airline mergers, the commission said.
Page 113 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Aer Lingus and the Irish government have argued that a combined entity would have a 70%-plus market share of domestic short-haul routes. Ryanair has lower average fares, while Aer Lingus pilots have higher wages.

Both airlines serve the busy Dublin-London market, albeit to different airports around the U.K. capital. Aer Lingus also flies to European cities, but, unlike Ryanair, flies long-haul to Dubai and several U.S. cities.
Aer Lingus is the former Irish "flag"-carrier, which has changed its business model in recent years to offer mainly
"low-cost" short-haul flights. It operates more than 80 routes and carried more than 8.6 million passengers in
2006.

Ryanair is a considerably larger "low-cost" airline, having carried 42 million passengers in 2006 and offering services on more than 400 routes across Europe.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission can't force a  sale of Ryanair's stock in Aer Lingus,  the commission's antitrust official Neelie Kroes said in a press briefing Wednesday. [ 06-27-07 0549ET ]

Kroes also said she was confident that the decision to block  Ryanair's hostile  takeover bid for Aer Lingus  "is legally sound and will bear the scrutiny of the Court of First Instance, should it be appealed."
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Tuesday that he planned to appeal the decision in the European
Court.

The takeover bid was blocked because there was an "unprecedented number of routes where competition would have been harmed" and that would have been "unacceptable" to 14 million passengers currently flying on 35 routes to and from Ireland, Kroes said.

The move to block Ryanair's takeover bid was only the second time the commission had moved to block a merger since Kroes became antitrust commissioner in 2004, she said.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday blocked low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC's (RYA.DB) from buying its Irish peer Aer Lingus PLC (EIL1.DB), saying that such a merger would have led to a quasi monopoly in the Irish markets.

The block is the first in two decades of the commission's drive to consolidate European airtravel, where several larger deals have been passed. It is only the second merger case blocked during antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes's tenure and only the 20th out of the 3,500 cases reviewed since 1990.

The deal was effectively dead anyway, because Ryanair had failed to garner enough backing among Aer Lingus shareholders for the bid to go through, but the E.U.'s decision means Ryanair is unlikely to make a fresh offer for the Irish national carrier in the future.

By combining the two leading airlines operating from Ireland "the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties," the commission said in a press release.

It would also have given the combined company 80% share of all flights to and from Dublin airport, effectively making new entries to the market very difficult, the commission said.

Ryanair has made it clear that it will appeal the decision in the European Court, with Chief Executive Michael O'Leary saying Tuesday that any commission's block on the bid was "unjustified" and "fundamentally flawed." In a new statement Wednesday, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier called the decision unlawful and said it is confident that the European Court of First Instance will overturn the Commission decision.

"This prohibition reverses 20 years of E.U. airline consolidation which has seen the commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors," the company said in a statement Tuesday.
This leaves Aer Lingus struggling as a third-tier, loss-making regional carrier," O'Leary said at a press conference
Wednesday.

The Commission countered that it is confident that the decision to block Ryanair's hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus "is legally sound and will bear the scrutiny of the Court of First Instance, should it be appealed," said Kroes in a press briefing.
Aer Lingus Chairman John Sharman welcomed the decision saying it was good news for competition. "Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of
Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers," he said. " Aer Lingus
already competes successfully with Ryanair across many routes and will continue to do so in the interests of all
consumers."
He said the E.U. had carried out an "exhaustive" investigation.

Page 116 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
O'Leary said that the commission's decision to block the takeover was politically motivated with the Irish government being the only other opponent to the deal in addition to Aer Lingus.

the carrier. Ryanair's stake in the company seems stable for the moment as the European Commission can't
force a sale of Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus under merger regulation, Kroes said.

However there are other ways to make Ryanair give up its stake, said a person familiar with the matter. "Kroes made very clear she was talking about the merger regulation only," the person said. The commission can still refer the case to the Irish national regulator which probably has a lower threshold or review the case under broader competition regulation saying that the stake harms the competitive relationship.
Ryanair has said it wants to remain a long-term Aer Lingus shareholder even if the E.U. blocked its bid.

The Ryanair- Aer Lingus merger was the first time the commission had to assess a merger of two main airlines in a single country operating from the same "home" airport, which made the case different from previous airline mergers, the commission said.

EUR2.60.

2nd UPDATE: EU Blocks  Ryanair From BuyingAer Lingus

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday blocked low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.DB) from buying its Irish peer Aer Lingus PLC (EIL1.DB), saying such a merger would have led to a
quasi-monopoly in the Irish markets.

The block is the first in two decades of the commission's drive to consolidate European air travel, where several larger deals have been passed. It is only the second merger case blocked during antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes's tenure and only the 20th out of the 3,500 cases reviewed since 1990.

The deal was effectively dead anyway, because Ryanair had failed to garner enough backing among Aer Lingus shareholders for the bid to go through, but the E.U.'s decision means Ryanair will find it difficult to make a fresh offer for the Irish national carrier in the future.

However, it seems that Ryanair hasn't thrown in the towel yet and the company has said it will appeal the decision, calling the commission ruling "fundamentally flawed" and "unlawful".
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the E.U. approval was only ever part of a long-term strategy to cut
E.U. red tape. If the courts overturn the E.U. ruling, a future bid "may or may not arise ... or we may just sit on our
25% stake and nurse our losses," O'Leary said.

"The problem with Aer Lingus is that it's cost base is too high and its fares are too high," O'Leary said. "The difficulty now is we can't even make another offer because we haven't got through the regulatory process."
In a statement Wednesday, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier said it is confident that the European Court of First
Instance will overturn the Commission decision.

The commission said the case of Ryanair/ Aer Lingus was different from other airline cases it had approved in the past, as both airlines were based in Ireland and sharing Dublin as their 'home' port.

By combining the two leading airlines operating from Ireland "the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties," the commission said in a press release.

It would also have given the combined company 80% share of all flights to and from Dublin airport, effectively making new entries to the market very difficult, the commission said.

"This prohibition reverses 20 years of E.U. airline consolidation which has seen the commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors," the company said in a statement Tuesday.

The Commission countered that it is confident that the decision to block Ryanair's hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus "is legally sound and will bear the scrutiny of the Court of First Instance, should it be appealed," said Kroes in a press briefing.
But O'Leary accused the commission's decision to be politically motivated with the Irish government being the
only other opponent to the deal in addition to Aer Lingus. He accused the commission of disregarding some of the
evidence and remedies Ryanair had offered to support their bid "solely to appeal to the narrow interests of the
Irish government."

The commission said consumer choice was the core point considered by the commission. Their decision to stop the merger was "essential to safeguard Irish consumers," who depend heavily on air travel, Kroes said. A concentration of this magnitude would have "led to higher prices for more than 14 million E.U. passengers using these routes to and from Ireland each year," the commission said.

Ryanair had promised to cut Aer Lingus fares and completely remove their fuel surcharges, which would have resulted in EUR100 million per annum saves for consumers.

But the commission said the EUR100 million savings on Aer Lingus ticket costs would have been valid only for a year, while nothing was said about the cost of Ryanair ticket prices.

Remedies offered by Ryanair "were inadequate to remove the competition concerns," the commission said. In particular, the limited number of airport "slots" offered by Ryanair wasn't enough to ensure the continuation of sufficient competition on the Irish markets, the commission said.
Ryanair had offered to sell six to 10 Dublin based airport slots and find an upfront buyer such as Easyjet, said
O'Leary.

The commission forced Air France SA (3112.FR) and Dutch carrier KLM to give up takeoff and landing slots at their Amsterdam and Paris hubs when they merged in 2004.
Germany's Lufthansa AG (LHA.XE) and Swiss Air were also required to give up slots when they merged last year. Building up to the bid Ryanair had amassed a 25% stake in Aer Lingus shares, giving the company some sway
over Aer Lingus affairs. However, O'Leary said: "The only thing we'd be able to block at Aer Lingus is a takeover
bid".
Ryanair's stake in the company seems stable for the moment as the European Commission can't force a sale of
Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus under merger regulation, Kroes said.

Ryanair expressed confidence that this prohibition will be overturned because;

* This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited a merger between two companies which combined will have less than 5% of the E.U. market. * This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited an airline merger and reverses a 20 year policy of encouraging E.U. airline mergers, having previously approved the larger Air France/KLM merger and the Lufthansa/ Austrian/Swiss mergers. * This is the first time that an E.U. airline merger offered guaranteed fare reductions of over EUR100 million p.a. for the benefit of consumers.

EU Blocks  Ryanair From Buying  Irish Peer Aer Lingus

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday blocked low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC's (RYA.DB) from  buying  its Irish peer  Aer Lingus  PLC (EIL1.DB), saying that such a merger would have led to a quasi monopoly in the Irish markets.

The block is the first in two decades of the commission's drive to consolidate  European airtravel, where several larger deals have been passed.

By combining the two leading airlines operating from Ireland "the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties," the commission said in a press release.

Ryanair has made it clear that it will appeal the decision in the European Court, with O'Leary saying Tuesday that any commission's block on the bid was "unjustified" and "fundamentally flawed."

"This prohibition reverses 20 years of E.U. airline consolidation which has seen the commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors," the company said in a statement Tuesday.

Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said that the commission's decision to block the takeover was politically motivated with the Irish government being the only other opponent to the deal in addition to Aer Lingus. He accused the commission of disregarding some of the evidence and remedies Ryanair had offered to support their bid "solely to appeal to the narrow interests of the Irish government."

"Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport," said antitrust official Neelie Kroes in the press release. A concentration of this magnitude would have "most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 million E.U. passengers using these routes to and from Ireland each year," the commission said.

Ryanair had promised to cut Aer Lingus fares and completely remove their fuel surcharges, which would have resulted in EUR100 million per annum saves for consumers, Ryanair's O'leary said.

Remedies offered by Ryanair "were inadequate to remove the competition concerns," the commission said. In particular, the commission said that the limited number of airport "slots" offered by Ryanair wasn't enough to ensure that sufficient competition would continue on the Irish markets
Ryanair had offered to sell six to 10 Dublin based airport slots and find an upfront buyer such as Easyjet, said
O'Leary.

The commission forced Air France SA (3112.FR) and Dutch carrier KLM to give up takeoff and landing slots at their Amsterdam and Paris hubs when they merged in 2004.
Germany's Lufthansa AG (LHA.XE) and Swiss Air were also required to give up slots when they merged last year. But even without the antitrust clearance, Ryanair's takeover plans looked shaky. Ryanair holds 25% of Aer Lingus
shares, but shareholders with about 46% remain opposed to the bid. The Irish government, has a 25% stake in
the carrier.

The Ryanair- Aer Lingus merger was the first time the commission had to assess a merger of two main airlines in a single country operating from the same "home" airport, which made the case different from previous airline mergers, the commission said.

Aer Lingus and the Irish government have argued that a combined entity would have a 70%-plus market share of domestic short-haul routes. Ryanair has lower average fares, while Aer Lingus pilots have higher wages.

Both airlines serve the busy Dublin-London market, albeit to different airports around the U.K. capital. Aer Lingus also flies to European cities, but, unlike Ryanair, flies long-haul to Dubai and several U.S. cities.
Aer Lingus is the former Irish "flag"-carrier, which has changed its business model in recent years to offer mainly
"low-cost" short-haul flights. It operates more than 80 routes and carried more than 8.6 million passengers in
2006.

Ryanair is a considerably larger "low-cost" airline, having carried 42 million passengers in 2006 and offering services on more than 400 routes across Europe.

EU Kroes:EU Can't Force Ryanair To Sell Aer Lingus  Stake

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission can't force a  sale of Ryanair's stock in Aer Lingus,  the commission's antitrust official Neelie Kroes said in a press briefing Wednesday. [ 27-06-07 0949GMT ]

Kroes also said she was confident that the decision to block  Ryanair's hostile  takeover bid for Aer Lingus  "is legally sound and will bear the scrutiny of the Court of First Instance, should it be appealed."
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Tuesday that he planned to appeal the decision in the European
Court.

The takeover bid was blocked because there was an "unprecedented number of routes where competition would have been harmed" and that would have been "unacceptable" to 14 million passengers currently flying on 35 routes to and from Ireland, Kroes said.

The move to block Ryanair's takeover bid was only the second time the commission had moved to block a merger since Kroes became antitrust commissioner in 2004, she said.

Aer Lingus: EU's Ryanair Ruling Good News For Competition

DUBLIN (Dow Jones)-- Aer Lingus  Group PLC's (EIL1.DB) Chairman John Sharman Wednesday said the
European Union's opposition to Ryanair Holdings PLC's (RYAAY) hostile  bid is good news for competition.

"Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers," he said. "  Aer Lingus already competes successfully with Ryanair across many routes and will continue to do so in the interests of all consumers."
He said the E.U. had carried out an "exhaustive" investigation. [ 27-06-07 1022GMT ]
Earlier Wednesday, the E.U. Commission blocked low-cost airline Ryanair from buying the Irish state carrier Aer
Lingus, saying such a merger would have led to a quasi-monopoly in the Irish markets.

But the European Commission can't force a sale of Ryanair's 25% stake in Aer Lingus, the commission's antitrust official Neelie Kroes said in a press briefing earlier Wednesday.

Before the E.U. ruling, Ryanair admitted its hostile EUR2.80-a-share, EUR1.48 billion bid for Aer Lingus was unlikely to succeed due to shareholder opposition. However, it said it hasn't ruled out a future bid for the Ireland-based carrier.

Ryanair would need almost all the shares not held by Aer Lingus or its strategic allies to effect a full takeover. Last year, Aer Lingus' powerful Employee Share Ownership Trust - which has a 12.5% stake - voted 97% to reject Ryanair's hostile offer.
The Irish government, which owns 25% of Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus pilots (2.27%) and Irish billionaire Denis
O'Brien (2.3%) were all opposed to Ryanair's bid.

At 1012 GMT, Aer Lingus shares were down 0.8%, or 2 cents, at EUR2.60 on the Irish Stock Exchange, while Ryanair shares were flat at EUR5.00. Both stocks were outperforming a weaker overall market. The ISEQ Overall Index was down 1.5% at 9239.

Aer Lingus  Welcomes EU Commission's Prohibition Decision

Edited Press Release

LONDON (Dow Jones)--The Board of Aer Lingus  said Wednesday that it welcomes the E.U. Commission's prohibition decision, relating to Ryanair's hostile bid, announced Wednesday following an exhaustive investigation of the competition issues surrounding this unwelcome  bid.
"Wednesday's prohibition decision, following the E.U. Commission's exhaustive investigation, is good news for
Aer Lingus and for our customers. Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of
one dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of
consumers. Aer Lingus has made tremendous strides over a relatively short time in successfully executing our
strategy and that work will continue apace. We are determined to deliver on our excellent prospects as an
independent company and I'd like to thank our staff for their continued commitment," said John Sharman,
Chairman of Aer Lingus.

When Ryanair announced its offer last October, the Board advised shareholders to reject the offer on the basis that it ignored the Company's excellent prospects as an independent company and that it was anti-competitive.

The Board and management are focussed on delivery of Aer Lingus' strategy and have made significant progress over the past nine months on its successful execution. The EUR400 million raised in the IPO is facilitating the expansion and replacement of short haul and long haul aircraft and the on-going development of new routes. [

LONDON (Dow Jones)--Ryanair confirmed Wednesday it will appeal the E.U. Commission's unlawful decision to prohibit the  merger with Aer Lingus  to the European Court of First Instance.
Ryanair expressed confidence that this prohibition will be overturned because;



* This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited a merger between two companies which combined will have less than 5% of the E.U. market.

* This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited an airline merger and reverses a 20 year policy of encouraging E.U. airline mergers, having previously approved the larger
Air France/KLM merger and the Lufthansa/ Austrian/Swiss mergers.

* This is the first time that an E.U. airline merger offered guaranteed fare reductions of over EUR100 million p.a. for the benefit of consumers.

UPDATE: EU Blocks  Ryanair From BuyingAer Lingus

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday blocked low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC's (RYA.DB) from buying its Irish peer Aer Lingus PLC (EIL1.DB), saying that such a merger would have led to a quasi monopoly in the Irish markets.

The block is the first in two decades of the commission's drive to consolidate European airtravel, where several larger deals have been passed. It is only the second merger case blocked during antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes's tenure and only the 20th out of the 3,500 cases reviewed since 1990.

The deal was effectively dead anyway, because Ryanair had failed to garner enough backing among Aer Lingus shareholders for the bid to go through, but the E.U.'s decision means Ryanair is unlikely to make a fresh offer for the Irish national carrier in the future.

By combining the two leading airlines operating from Ireland "the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties," the commission said in a press release.

It would also have given the combined company 80% share of all flights to and from Dublin airport, effectively making new entries to the market very difficult, the commission said.

Ryanair has made it clear that it will appeal the decision in the European Court, with Chief Executive Michael O'Leary saying Tuesday that any commission's block on the bid was "unjustified" and "fundamentally flawed." In a new statement Wednesday, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier called the decision unlawful and said it is confident that the European Court of First Instance will overturn the Commission decision.

"This prohibition reverses 20 years of E.U. airline consolidation which has seen the commission approve all other mergers between larger competitors," the company said in a statement Tuesday.
This leaves Aer Lingus struggling as a third-tier, loss-making regional carrier," O'Leary said at a press conference
Wednesday.

The Commission countered that it is confident that the decision to block Ryanair's hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus "is legally sound and will bear the scrutiny of the Court of First Instance, should it be appealed," said Kroes in a press briefing.
Aer Lingus Chairman John Sharman welcomed the decision saying it was good news for competition. "Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of
Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers," he said. " Aer Lingus
already competes successfully with Ryanair across many routes and will continue to do so in the interests of all
consumers."
He said the E.U. had carried out an "exhaustive" investigation.

O'Leary said that the commission's decision to block the takeover was politically motivated with the Irish government being the only other opponent to the deal in addition to Aer Lingus. He accused the commission of disregarding some of the evidence and remedies Ryanair had offered to support their bid "solely to appeal to the narrow interests of the Irish government."

"Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport," said Kroes in the press release. A concentration of this magnitude would have "most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 million E.U. passengers using these routes to and from Ireland each year," the commission said.

O'Leary.

Germany's Lufthansa AG (LHA.XE) and Swiss Air were also required to give up slots when they merged last year. But even without the antitrust clearance, Ryanair's takeover plans looked shaky. Ryanair holds 25% of Aer Lingus
shares, but shareholders with about 46% remain opposed to the bid. The Irish government has a 25% stake in
the carrier. Ryanair's stake in the company seems stable for the moment as the European Commission can't
force a sale of Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus under merger regulation, Kroes said.

However there are other ways to make Ryanair give up its stake, said a person familiar with the matter. "Kroes made very clear she was talking about the merger regulation only," the person said. The commission can still refer the case to the Irish national regulator which probably has a lower threshold or review the case under broader competition regulation saying that the stake harms the competitive relationship.
Ryanair has said it wants to remain a long-term Aer Lingus shareholder even if the E.U. blocked its bid.

The Ryanair- Aer Lingus merger was the first time the commission had to assess a merger of two main airlines in a single country operating from the same "home" airport, which made the case different from previous airline mergers, the commission said.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday blocked low cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.DB) from buying its Irish peer Aer Lingus PLC (EIL1.DB), saying such a merger would have led to a
quasi-monopoly in the Irish markets.

The block is the first in two decades of the commission's drive to consolidate European air travel, where several larger deals have been passed. It is only the second merger case blocked during antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes's tenure and only the 20th out of the 3,500 cases reviewed since 1990.

The deal was effectively dead anyway, because Ryanair had failed to garner enough backing among Aer Lingus shareholders for the bid to go through, but the E.U.'s decision means Ryanair will find it difficult to make a fresh offer for the Irish national carrier in the future.

However, it seems that Ryanair hasn't thrown in the towel yet and the company has said it will appeal the decision, calling the commission ruling "fundamentally flawed" and "unlawful".
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the E.U. approval was only ever part of a long-term strategy to cut
E.U. red tape. If the courts overturn the E.U. ruling, a future bid "may or may not arise ... or we may just sit on our
25% stake and nurse our losses," O'Leary said.

"The problem with Aer Lingus is that it's cost base is too high and its fares are too high," O'Leary said. "The difficulty now is we can't even make another offer because we haven't got through the regulatory process."
In a statement Wednesday, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier said it is confident that the European Court of First
Instance will overturn the Commission decision.

The commission said the case of Ryanair/ Aer Lingus was different from other airline cases it had approved in the past, as both airlines were based in Ireland and sharing Dublin as their 'home' port.

By combining the two leading airlines operating from Ireland "the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties," the commission said in a press release.

Their decision to stop the merger was "essential to safeguard Irish consumers," who depend heavily on air travel, Kroes said. A concentration of this magnitude would have "led to higher prices for more than 14 million E.U. passengers using these routes to and from Ireland each year," the commission said.

Ryanair had promised to cut Aer Lingus fares and completely remove their fuel surcharges, which would have resulted in EUR100 million per annum saves for consumers.

But the commission said the EUR100 million savings on Aer Lingus ticket costs would have been valid only for a year, while nothing was said about the cost of Ryanair ticket prices.

Remedies offered by Ryanair "were inadequate to remove the competition concerns," the commission said. In particular, the limited number of airport "slots" offered by Ryanair wasn't enough to ensure the continuation of sufficient competition on the Irish markets, the commission said.
Ryanair had offered to sell six to 10 Dublin based airport slots and find an upfront buyer such as Easyjet, said
O'Leary.

The commission forced Air France SA (3112.FR) and Dutch carrier KLM to give up takeoff and landing slots at their Amsterdam and Paris hubs when they merged in 2004.
Germany's Lufthansa AG (LHA.XE) and Swiss Air were also required to give up slots when they merged last year. Building up to the bid Ryanair had amassed a 25% stake in Aer Lingus shares, giving the company some sway
over Aer Lingus affairs. However, O'Leary said: "The only thing we'd be able to block at Aer Lingus is a takeover
bid".
Ryanair's stake in the company seems stable for the moment as the European Commission can't force a sale of
Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus under merger regulation, Kroes said.

UPDATE: European Regulators Block  Ryanair's  Bid For Aer Lingus

LONDON (Dow Jones) -- E.U. regulators on Wednesday blocked low-cost airline  Ryanair Holdings' hostile  bid for
Irish rival Aer Lingus  Group, saying it would reduce consumer choice and lead to higher prices.

Together, the two airlines would control more than 80% of all European flights to and from Dublin Airport, the European Commission said. It claimed such a "monopoly" would deter new entrants to the market, particularly because of Ryanair's reputation for "aggressive retaliation" and its ability to temporarily slash fares.

"Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport," said E.U. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "We wanted to prevent the emergence of a monopoly, particularly in Ireland, which, as an island, is highly dependent on air transport."
It's the first time since 2004 that the commission has blocked a merger.
Ryanair (RYAAY) shares rose 0.6% in London. Aer Lingusshares slipped 1.7%.
Ryanair had anticipated the veto. On Tuesday, before the decision was officially released, Europe's largest
low-cost airline argued that the E.U. move was politically motivated and aimed to please the Irish government,
Aer Lingus' main shareholder, which had opposed the 1.48 billion-euro tie-up.
The Irish government holds a roughly 25.4% stake in Aer Lingus.

Chief Executive Michael O' Leary vowed to appeal the decision in the European Court of Justice. He argued that the commission was wrong to block the proposed deal after clearing mergers between Air France and KLM and between Lufthansa and Swissair.

Kroes argued Wednesday that the Air France-KLM (AKH) merger was not comparable because the two airlines had different hubs while Ryanair and Aer Lingus share Dublin Airport as their base. A tie-up would thus have radically altered the competitive landscape at Dublin, Kroes said.

Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete directly on 35 routes to and from Ireland, she said, and the combination would have given them a monopoly on 22 routes.

Although the commission acknowledged that Ryanair offered some guarantees to limit the impact on competition at Dublin, it said the proposals weren't enough to soothe its concerns, calling them "inadequate."

A plan to cut Aer Lingus' fares by 10% during the first year following the merger would, for instance, be impossible to monitor, Kroes argued. She added that a one-year guarantee wasn't sufficient. [ 06-27-07 0701ET ]

The European Commission is expected to block  Ryanair's plans to takeoverAer Lingus  when it discusses the matter later today.
The no-frills airline launched the surprise  bid after the Government privatised the national carrier last year.

The EC, however, is expected to block the attempted buy-out on the grounds that it would harm competition in the aviation sector.

Yesterday, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary attacked opponents of the takeover and vowed to sue the commission if it ruled against his plans.

EU blocks  Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus

Ryanair’s takeover of Ireland’s national carrier  Aer Lingus  was blocked by the European Commission today as a threat to consumer choice and a recipe for higher fares.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said an inquiry had decided that a  merger between the two leading airlines operating from Ireland would remove the existing "vigorous" competition between them and create a monopoly on the 35 routes they share.
The result would be reduced choice and, "most likely", higher prices for more than 14 million EU passengers. A Commission statement also blamed Ryanair’s reputation for "aggressive retaliation" for further reducing the
chances of opening up competition from rival airlines.

Ryanair immediately announced a legal appeal after boss Michael O’Leary claimed Brussels was biased against his company and was preventing a merger which would mean lower fares for passengers flying in and out of Dublin airport.
Ryanair already owns 25% of Aer Lingus and attacked the Commission ban on a full takeover as "bizarre" and
"illogical".

But Ms Kroes told a press conference in Brussels at the end of a major monopolies investigation by EU officials: "Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport, and other EU consumers.
"Monopolies are bad for consumers because they reduce choice, lower quality and give rise to higher prices –
and low-cost carriers such as Ryanair are no exception to this rule."

Mr O’Leary, whose airline is one of the biggest in the world, had submitted merger plans to Brussels designed to remove any objections – including a guarantee of lower fares and an end to fuel surcharges for passengers using the new merged airline.
But Ms Kroes said the "remedies" offered by Ryanair to avoid the merger creating an illegal monopoly under EU
rules "were not sufficient to remove the competition concerns".

Mr O’Leary will take the case to the European Court in Luxembourg, arguing that the planned merger would be between two companies which jointly account for less than 5% of EU air traffic – far less than the share enjoyed by Air France and KLM, and other airlines which have been allowed by the Commission to merge.

But the Commission denies charges that it is "politically biased" against Ryanair, pointing out that the takeover involves two key carriers operating from the same place, and with little prospect, in the Commission’s view, of rival carriers competing on Dublin routes.

A Commission statement said a limited number of take-off and landing "slots" at Dublin would discourage competitors.

It went on: "The investigation also revealed that most airlines were unlikely to enter into direct competition against a merged Ryanair/ Aer Lingus in Ireland.

"This is not only because the merged entity would be able to operate from the very large bases of Ryanair and Aer Lingus in Ireland ... but also because Ryanair has a reputation of aggressive retaliation against any entry attempt by competitors."

Answering Ryanair complaints that the Commission has approved all other mergers between competing European airlines in the last 20 years, the Commission statement said the Irish case was different: it was the first proposed merger between the two main airlines in a single country operating from the same "home" airport, with an unprecedented number of overlapping routes between them.

Ryanair and Aer Lingus are by far the biggest airlines offering short-haul European flights to and from Ireland, and the two companies were "the main competitive constraints on each other" on those routes.
If merged, they would account for about 80% of all European air traffic in and out of Ireland.
Ryanair operates more than 400 routes across Europe, and carried more than 40 million passengers last year. Aer Lingus has increasingly moved into the "low-cost" carrier market, operating more than 80 routes and carrying
more than 8.6 million passengers in 2006.

Consumers Association welcomes  EU's Ryanair decision

Aer Lingus  has welcomed the decision by the  European Commission to block Ryanair's attempt to  take over
the State airline.

Aer Lingus  said consumers have gained from competition between the two airlines and the  EC made the right decision.

The Consumers Association has also welcomed the outcome, saying a Ryanair monopoly would result in the airline making more money and the travelling public getting less value.

Announcing the decision today, Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said a merger between the two companies would be a threat to consumer choice and a recipe for higher fares.

She said there is currently vigorous competition between the rival airlines, but a Ryanair buy-out would create a monopoly on the 35 routes they share.

Ryanair had promised to reduce fares if the takeover was approved, but Ms Kroes said this was not enough to address "competition concerns" given the airline's aggressive track record in trying to prevent rival carriers from entering the market.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has already vowed to launch a legal challenge to the decision at the
European Court in Luxembourg.

Ryanair has rounded off its share price at €5 proving it is still on steady ground despite the uncertainty surrounding its Aer Lingusbid.

Ryanair’s takeover of the former state-owned carrier was blocked by the  European Commission today as a threat to consumer choice and a recipe for higher fares.
Ryanair owner Michael O’Leary expressed confidence that the Commission decision would be overturned by the
European court.

He described the decision to block the takeover as "unprecedented and unlawful" and rejected an Aer Lingus claim that the Commission move was a boost for the national carrier and its customers.
Mr O’Leary said the Aer Lingus share price was now significantly below Ryanair’s takeover offer of €2.80. Aer Lingus closed down 2c today at €2.60.
Elsewhere all the banking big guns spent the day languishing in negative territory.
The biggest loser Anglo Irish fell 62c to close at €14.88. AIB and Bank of Ireland lost 40 and 49c at €20.30 and
€14.80 respectively.
IL&P fell 33c at €18.34.

Ryanair accuses EU of takeover bias.
Jamie Smyth in Brussels

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has accused the  EU of making a "nakedly political decision" by blocking
Ryanair's proposed takeover of Aer Lingus.

At a press conference in Brussels yesterday, Mr O'Leary also said  Ryanair would contest the  merger decision by the European Commission in the European courts.

Speaking ahead of a formal merger decision due to be published today by the commission, Mr O'Leary said the commission was biased against Ryanair and was acting in support of national flag carriers that had the support of governments.

"This decision is politically motivated, designed to appease the narrow interests of the Irish Government, which was the only party - other than Aer Lingus itself - to object to the merger," said Mr O'Leary, who added that the Government's objections to the merger would be transposed word for word in the final decision by the commission.

A spokesman for the commission said no final decision had been taken yet by the college of commissioners and denied allegations that it would be a political decision.

"I can refute that completely. The commission is completely impartial and objective, and all major decisions are subject to challenge at the court of first instance," he said.

Mr O'Leary said he was holding the press conference before the formal EU decision was announced to counter a constant stream of leaks orchestrated by the commission.
The commission also categorically denied this allegation from the Ryanair boss.

Mr O'Leary said he would also oppose in the courts any decision by the commission to force Ryanair to sell its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus on the basis that Ryanair had no control over Aer Lingus.

He said Ryanair had asked Aer Lingus to do three things since it had built up its stake: to reduce prices, to remove the fuel surcharge and not to buy new aircraft at the top of the cycle.

Aer Lingus had done the opposite, said Mr O'Leary, who added that Ryanair also had no seat on the Aer Lingus board.

He warned that the proposed commission decision could reverse 20 years of EU airline consolidation in Europe, which had seen the commission approve all other mergers of large competitors.
For example the commission had approved the mergers of the Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa
Austrian airlines, he added.

"There is one rule for national flag carriers and another rule for low cost operators," said Mr O'Leary, who confirmed that Ryanair would take the commission to the European Court of First Instance over the decision.

He said he was confident of winning the case given that the commission has lost eight of the 20 merger cases that it has blocked since 1990 and the methodologyused in the decision was flawed.

"The decision is manifestly in error since it is based on the commission's inaccurate claim that there are barriers to entry at Dublin airport, when the case file evidence clearly proves that there are no barriers to entry at Dublin airport," said Mr O'Leary.

He said the commission was using a "base" competition concept - Ryanair and Aer Lingus both have their home base in Dublin - to back up its decision. He said this had no precedent and was a misapplication of 25-year-old US cases.

The commission had also failed to take into account the proposed consumer benefits and extensive remedies offered by Ryanair in an effort to get the merger passed.

For example, Ryanair had guaranteed consumers €100 million in lower fares every year, which would be refunded to consumers if the airline failed to achieve them.

Ryanair had also offered to transfer slots at Dublin airport to competitors, as long as they based six to 10 aircraft in the city. This amounts to 2,800 weekly slots, said Mr O'Leary, who noted Aer Lingus/Ryanair had a 5 per cent share of EU air traffic.

Asked by journalists why the Government would want to block a merger, Mr O'Leary said the airport was in Taoiseach Bertie Ahern's constituency, Aer Lingus was heavily unionised and it was part of the "Byzantine movements of the Government".

In a statement, Aer Lingus criticised Ryanair's claims. "Michael O'Leary has sought to 'take out' his closest competitor and he has failed," Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion said.
"He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure." Document IRTI000020070627e36r00028

UPDATE 1-EU Commission blocks  Ryanair's  bid for Aer Lingus
By David Lawsky and Sabina Zawadzki
672 words
27 June 2007
11:32

(Adds Kroes,  Ryanair stake, Aer Lingus  reaction, share prices)

BRUSSELS, June 27 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Wednesday blocked an attempt by  Ryanair to acquire rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus,  marking only the second  merger prohibition by the  EU executive in four years.

The Commission, confirming a Reuters report from May 30, decided the combination would destroy competition at Dublin Airport where Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, and Aer Lingus are based.

"The acquisition would have combined the two leading airlines operating from Ireland which currently compete vigorously against each other," the European Union's top competition watchdog said in a statement.

"The Commission concluded that the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties."
But EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the EU's top antitrust body could not force Ryanair to sell its
25 percent stake in Aer Lingus. Brussels lawyers and Commission watchers had expected such a divestiture.
The stake gives Ryanair veto power over some decisions by the rival carrier.

"Since Ryanair is not in a position to exercise de jure or de facto control of Aer Lingus ... the Commission is not in a position to require Ryanair to divest its minority share," she told reporters.

Ryanair shares in Dublin were unchanged on the day at 5.00 euros but outperforming a 1.8 percent fall in the broader Irish market. Aer Lingus was down 0.76 percent at 2.6 euros.

Ryanair's offer, originally valued at 1.48 billion euros ($2 billion), becomes only the 20th prohibition among more than 3,000 cases reviewed by the European Union executive since 1990.

Kroes praised Ryanair for taking advantage of liberalisation in the airline industry to slash prices and give choice to consumers.

"Ryanair has provided consumers with more competition and more choice, but, and that is crucial, Ryanair cannot now take away that choice," she said.
COURT CASE
In some ways, Aer Lingus owes its own success to Ryanair.

Ryanair's cut-rate prices and expanding choice of destinations have forced Aer Lingus to transform from a staid, high-priced Irish flag carrier into a tough no-frills competitor ready to match its rival ticket for ticket and route for route.
Aer Lingus, privatised last year, welcomed the Commission's decision against the hostile bid.
Ryanair, expecting the EU executive to block the deal, had lashed out against the Commission on Tuesday.

"This decision is politically motivated, designed to appease the narrow interests of the Irish government, which was the only party -- other than Aer Lingus itself -- to object to the merger," Ryanair Chief Exxecutive Michael O'Leary said.
He reiterated Ryanair would appeal against the decision at the EU's second highest court, the Court of First
Instance.
Kroes said on Wednesday she was confident the decision was legally sound.
In a confidential charge sheet earlier this year, the Commission had laid out a tough case against the merger. The robustness of the charge sheet will be important once the decision is appealed to the court, which in past
cases has scrutinised the fairness of such claims.

The charge sheet, known as a statement of objections, said that in the past six years the number of routes on which the carriers competed had jumped to 37 from eight, driving prices down by 5 to 8 percent.

Ryanair offered proposals it said could assure competition despite a merger, but they were never enough to satisfy the Commission. For example, the carrier offered to make space for a new rival to base as many as six planes at Dublin Airport.

Ryanair also offered to sell Aer Lingus' slots at London's Heathrow and Dublin for flights between the two airports. (Additional reporting by Paul Taylor in Brussels and Paul Hoskins in Dublin)
