4:52 (Dow Jones) Some hurt feelings can be expected at Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX) after a year's worth of work on their exchange deal comes to naught. Aside from frustration already voiced in the direction of  EU antitrust examiners who helped nix the  merger, don't expect the former partners' fingers to
publicly point at one another -- non-disparagement clause in the deal terms says that neither company's employees can dump on the business or reputation of the other for a period of 12 months. After that, it's open season. And some leeway is granted in the name of "legitimate competition." (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

4:45 (Dow Jones) Sunoco (SUN) continues its transition into a gas station company. Higher gasoline prices brought SUN's retail segment earnings to $40M pre-tax, up from $1M a year earlier. In contrast, SUN's main refining segment posts $117M pre-tax loss, compared to a $17M loss the year before. SUN blames higher oil prices and shutdown of its Marcus Hook refinery, which brought the company's run rate to 80% of capacity for the quarter. SUN up 2.5% after hours at $39.20. (ben.lefebvre@dowjones.com)

4:42 (Dow Jones) Networking gear maker Acme Packet (APKT) disappoints again, reporting results that fall short of a lowered forecast it gave just a month ago. In January, APKT warned lukewarm spending among North American telecoms was hurting its business. Peer Juniper Networks (JNPR) has seen similar problems of late amid signs telcos are only spending to upgrade certain parts of their infrastructure. Shares off 1.9% at $30.29 in after-hours trading. (matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com)
4:40 (Dow Jones) Reinsurer Validus Holdings (VR) estimates its loss from the Costa Concodia shipwreck to be
$50M-$65M, about 15% of the estimated total insured loss from the event. Paying claims on large losses is what
reinsurers do, of course, but VR clearly comes out on the short end of the stick on this particular disaster. To put
VR's Costa Concordia loss in context, the company tallied $54.1M in losses from the massive flooding in Thailand
in 4Q. Some tallies put industrywide Thailand flood losses at $10B, while the industrywide insured losses from the
shipwreck are said by VR to be under $1B. (erik.holm@dowjones.com)

4:38 (Dow Jones) CME Group (CME) CFO Jamie Parisi tells investors that exchange company expects to sell most of the historic Chicago Board of Trade building, home to its trading floors and some offices, in the first half of this year. Parisi described owning the building as a "break-even" business. Traders will continue to gesticulate inside the building at the foot of Chicago's LaSalle Street even after the sale, and CME is no longer eyeing a
move out of state after Illinois last year cut exchanges a deal on taxes, but company has said it's not interested in managing real estate. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

4:31 (Dow Jones) Edwards Lifesciences (EW) 4Q results beat consensus on adjusted EPS but miss revenue estimates, in part due to late approval of a catheter-delivered heart valve, called Sapien. Device gained US approval in November for patients too sick for open heart surgery. EW's 1Q guidance is conservative, but that's "probably prudent given that you're still in the very early days of the Sapien launch," says analyst Jason Mills at Canaccord Genuity in an interview. He expects stocking orders of Sapien at new centers to ramp up throughout the year. Still, EW down 3.9% to $77.50 in after-hours trading. (anjali.athavaley@dowjones.com)

4:29 (Dow Jones) THQ (THQI) warned investors that its uDraw game tablet had not fared well this holiday, but clearly didn't realize it was this bad. THQI posted non-GAAP sales of $404.4M during 3Q, well below consensus expectations of $417.6M. The same was true for earnings, which the company said its non-GAAP EPS came in at
35c, well below the 65c expected by analysts. THQI said in response, it is restructuring its business, ditching its kids gaming division and cutting the CEO's pay. But investors are still unhappy, taking the company's shares down 21% to 60c in late trading. (ian.sherr@dowjones.com)

4:28 (Dow Jones) Sunoco (SUN) throws up its hands and says it can't find a buyer for its refinery in Marcus Hook, Pa. Worse yet, the Northeast refiner didn't even receive an offer for the 178,000 barrel-a-day plant it put on the market last year. Options include running Marcus Hook as a storage terminal or just shutting it down -- SUN says it's establishing a $250M for "remediation of legacy environmental obligations," just the sort of thing needed for closing an older refinery. SUN says it's still pursuing a sale of its 335,000 b/d Philadelphia refinery. (ben.lefebvre@dowjones.com)

4:23 (Dow Jones) Netsuite (N), the maker of Web-based business software backed by Oracle (ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison, beats analysts' expectations for 4Q improvement on the top and bottom line. Calculated billings, an indicator of future performance, up 36%. "Our cloud computing suite continued to take market share from traditional" business software vendors, CEO Zach Nelson says. The 4Q could be considered "our best quarter ever as a public company," he adds Netsuite up 2.6% at $45.50 in late trading. (matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com)

4:20 (Dow Jones) The economic crisis has changed the way universities market themselves to potential students, who are more focused on the "value proposition" for their college investment than before, says Doug Kilcommons of Fitch Ratings. Colleges now have to focus on student "outcomes," such as how quickly they can get a job after school, and how high starting salaries are for recent graduates. Previously, schools focused on "inputs," such as fancy dorm facilities, high-profile professors or good sports programs. Universities back a significant amount of municipal bonds. Last week, for example, the University of Chicago sold more than $500M in municipal bonds. (mike.cherney@dowjones.com)

4:18 (Dow Jones) Sunoco (SUN) decides to make a splash for its penultimate quarter as a refining business. The northeast refiner says Thursday it will repurchase 19.9% of its shares over the next year and a half and raise its quarterly dividend by 33% to 20c a share. It's the least SUN can do for shareholders who are still around for another dismal quarter on the earnings front - SUN also posts a pretax loss of $660M. SUN had already said it
will give up its refineries by summer; CEO Lynn Elsenhans says Thursday she'll step down from the CEO position to stay on as chairwoman. (ben.lefebvre@dowjones.com)

4:15 (Dow Jones) Fourth-quarter earnings can now be considered a tailwind for stocks, as growth estimates have risen above pre-earnings-season expectations for the first time. With 49% of the S&P 500 reporting results, the blended -- reported and estimated -- year-over-year earnings growth estimate is now up to 8.2%, according to Thomson Reuters, above the 7.9% estimate as of Jan. 3. The estimate was as low as 5.5% on Jan. 18. The
sector beating expectations the most is technology, which is showing 16.7% growth vs. a Jan. 3 estimate of
10.3%, while energy has missed the most, with growth of 12.3% vs. an earlier estimate of 24.3%.

(c) 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
0724 GMT [Dow Jones] JPMorgan Cazenove upgrades Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE) to neutral from underweight with a target of EUR45. Despite the termination of the company's proposed  merger with NYSE Euronext, the brokerage notes Deutsche Boerse referred to "solid growth in sales revenue" in line "with market expectations"
at the announcement. In JPMorgan's view, the company also raised the possibility of capital repatriation beyond the usual annual ordinary dividend. Should the company persist with that intention, the fact that the "stock trades at a small premium to the sector", may in due course be justified, it says. However, the brokerage sees a challenging period ahead for the industry, and struggles to see a re-rating opportunity for the stock against its peer group. Shares closed Wednesday at EUR45.48.

0901 GMT [Dow Jones] Commerzbank downgrades Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE) to add from buy following the EU Commission's decision to prohibit its  merger with NYSE Euronext. Cuts its target price to EUR53 from EUR62, saying the new target includes a EUR3 per share negative risk shield from a possible introduction of a transaction tax. "We believe Deutsche Boerse will focus on generating organic growth supported by smaller acquisitions," it says, but considers larger acquisitions unlikely, as suitable targets are rare and antitrust considerations remain a significant hurdle. Shares +2.2% at EUR46.50. (nicky.redl@dowjones.com)

NYSE-Deutsche Boerse Merger Block Proof Of EU Vigilance  - EU Almunia

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso issued a stout defense of the regional bloc's antitrust policies Thursday, saying its competition system was a "model" of independence and "diligence."

Speaking at a seminar on competition policy in Brussels the day after the European Union's antitrust authorities blocked the merger of global exchanges  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and NYSE Euronext (NYX), Barroso said the commission has "one of the best competition systems in the world."

"Despite the criticism we sometimes face for our decisions, European competition law is cited as a model of independence, coherence and objectivity," he said, according to a text of his remarks.

Barroso said the EU would continue battling against monopolies and protectionism, saying these have "an immensely corrosive effect" on the economy and society.
But he acknowledged the EU must "work hard" to keep its antitrust system running well.

"Today, and moving forward, we are committed to keeping our system vigilant, fair, open and capable of evolving with the times," he said.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Union's antitrust chief Thursday defended the decision to block a proposed merger between NYSE Euronext (NYX) and Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE), reiterating it would have resulted in a "quasi monopoly" that would have harmed consumers.

Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner, said the decision was proof of how seriously the EU takes competition regulation.

"The latest proof of our continued vigilance is in today's papers. Yesterday, the European Commission prohibited the proposed merger between Deutsche Boerse and New York Stock Exchange - Euronext," he said.

Almunia said the decision was a rare one. "I rarely have to propose the prohibition of a merger; since I took office, this is the second time. This means that I do not do so lightly; but I have done and will continue to do so whenever necessary," he said.

The proposed US$18.1 billion tie-up had been in the hands of EU competition officials for the past 18 months, before the announcement of their decision Wednesday.

Almunia said the EU had tried to reach an agreement with the two companies involved, but in the end their offers had been insufficient to quell concerns that the merger would result in an unacceptable outcome.

"We tried to find a solution with the two companies; but unfortunately the remedies they proposed were too limited," he said.

- EU Barroso says EU competition policy among "best in the world" (Updates with Barroso comments, context. Recasts throughout)
By Matina Stevis and Laurence Norman
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European leaders defended their decision to block the high-profile proposed merger between NYSE Euronext (NYX) and Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE) Thursday and promised heightened vigilance in the future.

The European Union's antitrust chief reiterated that the tie-up between the two stock exchanges would have resulted in a "quasi monopoly" that would have harmed consumers.

Speaking at a competition conference in Brussels the day after blocking the merger, Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner, said the decision showed how seriously the EU takes competition regulation.

"The latest proof of our continued vigilance is in today's papers. Yesterday, the European Commission prohibited the proposed merger between Deutsche Boerse and New York Stock Exchange - Euronext," he said.

"We decided to block the deal because it would have established a near monopoly in the market for listed derivatives based on European interest rates or equity. Because derivatives are vital for Europe's economy, we could not let this happen," he added.

Almunia said the decision was a rare one. "I rarely have to propose the prohibition of a merger; since I took office, this is the second time. This means that I do not do so lightly; but I have done and will continue to do so whenever necessary," he said.
He had earlier received the full support of his boss, European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso. Barroso issued a stout defense of the regional bloc's antitrust policies Thursday, saying its competition system
was a "model" of independence and "diligence."

Speaking at the same forum, Barroso said the commission has "one of the best competition systems in the world."

"Despite the criticism we sometimes face for our decisions, European competition law is cited as a model of independence, coherence and objectivity," he said, according to a text of his remarks.
But he acknowledged the EU must "work hard" to keep its antitrust system running well.

"Today, and moving forward, we are committed to keeping our system vigilant, fair, open and capable of evolving with the times," he said.
The proposed $18.1 billion tie-up between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse had been in the hands of EU
competition officials for the past 18 months, before the announcement of their decision Wednesday.

"We tried to find a solution with the two companies; but unfortunately the remedies they proposed were too limited," he said.

The US competition authorities had cleared the ill-fated NYSE-Deutsche Boers tie-up earlier this year, demanding minor concessions on the part of the two companies.

The World from Berlin - Price of Exchanges  Merger 'Would Have Been Too High'

It's back to the drawing board for stock exchange companies  Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext after the European Commission blocked their  merger plans. German commentators ask if the megal-deal was even a good idea in the first place.

Wednesday was "a black day for Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets" -- at least if Deutsche Börse is to be believed. That's how the Frankfurt-based stock exchange operator reacted to the news that its planned merger with NYSE Euronext had been vetoed by EU antitrust regulators.

Investors, however, seemed unperturbed by the news. On Thursday, shares in Deutsche Börse were even up by over 4 percent at times, trading above &#128;47 ($62), amid expectations that the company would return cash to shareholders. NYSE Euronext's shares fell by just 0.5 percent on Wednesday. The consequences of the failed merger are not as bad as the companies would like to paint, it seems.

Announcing its decision on Wednesday, the European Commission, the EU's executive body which is also responsible for regulating competition within the bloc, argued that the combined company would have had too much power over trading in European derivatives. Together, the two companies control more than 90 percent of the trade in European exchange-traded financial derivatives through their Eurex and Liffe exchanges. The firms argued in return that a large portion of the trading in derivatives does not take place on exchanges, but in direct or over-the-counter (OTC) trading between banks.

The two potential merger partners had tried to save the multi-billion euro deal, which was originally announced in February 2011, by offering to divest their overlapping businesses. Antitrust officials had previously said that the two companies would have to sell off an entire derivatives business, but the exchanges clearly weren't prepared to go that far.
On Thursday, German media commentators generally have scathing words for the failed merger. The center-left
Süddeutsche Zeitung writes:

"The true value of a planned merger can be seen only when the deal collapses at the last minute. Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext had insisted that they didn't just want to merge -- they claimed they had to. The survival of
the two companies depended on it -- that's what the two CEOs effectively said a year ago when the merger plans were announced."

"The $9 billion deal would have produced the world's largest stock exchange. The idea was to set up a Frankfurt-Wall Street axis as a bulwark against Asian competition. Everyone was supposed to benefit from the deal &#133; and the executive boards and shareholders were all convinced that it had to happen."

"And now? Is Deutsche Börse or its New York rival in danger of economic collapse now that the merger has been blocked? The two CEOS, Reto Francioni and Duncan Niederauer, who apparently cared so much about the
trans-Atlantic merger, may be disappointed, but their response to Wednesday's decision was full of defiance: The merger isn't going to happen? Never mind, we can do very well by ourselves."

"We could be forgiven for asking in return: In that case, why did they put so much effort into preparations for the deal, lobbying and advertising campaigns over the last few months? Were the egos of the two managers bigger than the expected gains?"

The center-right
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes:

"From the first day on, this newspaper argued at length that the merger would bring more disadvantages than advantages for Deutsche Börse. Just preparing for the merger consumed a lot of effort and money and meant that the real work of developing the company was put on the back burner. A trans-Atlantic integration process would have caused this situation to continue for years, given the considerable resentment on both sides of the Atlantic. The benefits of the merger -- mainly cost savings -- were just calculations on paper and had yet to be subjected to the real-world test."

"For the European stock exchange landscape, it is therefore an advantage that the continent's largest exchange company will retain its independence. Deutsche Börse is well enough positioned to compete on its own. It has significant opportunities to develop in terms of shifting OTC trading onto exchange platforms. And even without
the Americans by their side, they should not shy away from trying to get a bigger foothold in emerging economies. If it were to enter into technology partnerships with stock markets in those countries, then Deutsche Börse would become really strong."
The
Financial Times Deutschland writes:

"The European Commission's decision to veto the merger between Deutsche Börse and its trans-Atlantic rival NYSE Euronext is no great drama for the Frankfurt-based company. It's true that the list of its failed merger plans is a long one -- almost embarrassingly so -- and it just got longer."

"But even without a merger partner, the company is well positioned, because it is present in the whole securities trading value chain and can collect fees everywhere. That includes classic stock trading, which is currently a source of particular pleasure to Deutsche Börse because the financial crisis has increased the speed of trading and therefore boosted revenues. It also includes the booming trade in derivatives, in the shape of Deutsche Börse's subsidiary Eurex -- the sticking point that caused the deal with NYSE to collapse."

"All in all, Deutsche Börse may have missed a chance to become even bigger. But the price it would have had to pay -- for example, selling off Eurex to placate Brussels -- would have been too high. In the meantime, the company can grow under its own steam."
In a guest editorial for the business daily
Handelsblatt, Christine Bortenlänger, the CEO of Munich Stock Exchange, writes:

"What is at stake here is not just the position (of the companies) in terms of global competition. It is also about the importance of the exchanges as actors in the powerplays on the financial markets. As important as it is to prevent cartels and to support the free market, a strengthening of exchange-based trading would have been a much needed and very timely signal, especially against the backdrop of the financial crisis and calls for greater regulation of financial markets. Exchanges provide maximum transparency and ensure fair and transparent pricing."

"It has long been a fact, however, that large segments of the securities trading business are handled outside the strictly regulated exchanges. The biggest competitors of NYSE and Deutsche Börse are not just the emerging exchanges in Asia, but also over-the-counter (OTC) trading between the major investment houses &#133;. In derivatives trading, for example, OTC trading accounts for between 80 and 90 percent of the market. For this reason alone, it is difficult to understand why the EU assumes a merger would have led to a dominant position in this area."

"The commissioners' decision is a decision in favor of a provincial and anachronistic isolation of Europe from the world. That's something that an export-oriented country like Germany can not support. It's time that the EU thought beyond its own borders, and thinks of itself as an important region on the global scale -- and also acts in a way that is open to the world."
The left-leaning
Die Tageszeitung writes:


Page 15 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Many investors were actually relieved that the mega-wedding was prevented. After all, it was not clear whether a merger would have paid off. It would have required enormous investments, until the famous synergy effects possibly appeared at some point. But Deutsche Börse didn't even need to take such risks: Their profits are rising rapidly, and their profit margin is already over 50 percent. Other companies can only dream of such figures."

"Deutsche Börse's enormous profits are a signal, however, that competition between exchanges is not working. Otherwise, Deutsche Börse would not reap such monopoly-style profits. This leads to a fundamental question: Does it even make sense for stock exchanges to be organized as private companies? They have a central economic function by providing a market for financial products."

"This economic importance will continue to rise in the future. Until now, many financial transactions have been handled 'over the counter' -- in other words, directly between banks. But since the financial crisis, it has become clear that all transactions should be handled on exchanges. The risks must be visible, and nothing is as transparent as a standardized market. Ultimately this means that we need a stock exchange monopoly -- and only the state can hold a monopoly."
-- David Gordon Smith

Deutsche Börse is expected to appeal after Brussels formally vetoed its $7.3 billion (£4.6 billion)  merger with
NYSE Euronext.

Although the vote was said to be close, Joaquín Almunia, the Competition Commissioner, was central to the decision, arguing that a combination of the two would have created a "nearmonopoly" in the trading of European derivatives on worldwide exchanges.

fixed-income derivatives trading, while NYSE Euronext owns Liffe, the London derivatives market that deals in
interest rate and equity-based contracts.

EU blocks  Deutsche Boerse, NYSEmerger

BRUSSELS — The  European Union yesterday blocked Deutsche Boerse’s planned merger with NYSE Euronext, a US$10 billion (S$12.5 billion) deal that would have created the world’s largest stock exchange operator.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which unveiled the plan as long ago as last February, said they would now unwind the deal.

“The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide,” EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said. “These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive.”

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext had refused to sell either the German operator’s Eurex derivatives market operator or the US company’s London-based futures exchange Liffe to address such concerns.

The commission’s decision, although not entirely unexpected, deals a blow to the two bourse operators, who hoped a merger would have allowed them to compete better with other large exchanges in the United States and Asia.

“This is a black day for Europe and its global competitiveness on financial markets,’’ said Deutsche Boerse CEO Reto Francioni. He added that the decision will prevent the creation of a “globally competitive” European exchange group that would have helped strengthen the commission’s push for transparent and stable financial markets across Europe and the world.

A $9BILLION (£5.7billion) deal to create the world's biggest operator of stock markets was yesterday blocked by the European Commission.

The proposed tie between  NYSE Euronext, whose interests include the New York Stock Exchange and markets in Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels, and German group Deutsche Boerse was blocked on competition grounds. Authorities have vetoed every major stock- exchange deal since NYSE merged with Euronext in 2007.

Europe stopped the deal because it said it would have created a "near monopoly" in financial derivatives, products based on the performance of something else, such as a stock market index. "These markets remain at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive," said competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia. Deutsche Boerse said the decision was a "black day" for Europe. NYSE Euronext said it was "disappointed".

Exchange groups, including the London Stock Exchange, might now be forced into partnership arrangements rather than formal mergers.

Brussels calls halt to stock exchange mega-merger

An ambitious German plan to create the world’s biggest stock exchange was all but dead in the water yesterday after European regulators blocked the deal on competition grounds.

Deutsche Börse is expected to appeal after Brussels formally vetoed its $7.3 billion  merger with NYSE Euronext.

Joaquín Almunia, the Competition Commissioner, was central to the decision to scupper the planned merger, which has been in the works for almost exactly a year. Mr Almunia had argued that a combination of the two would have created a “near-monopoly" in the trading of European derivatives on worldwide exchanges.
The Frankfurt exchange owns Eurex, which dominates the trading of contracts denominated in euros and
fixed-income derivatives trading, while NYSE Euronext owns Liffe, the London derivatives market that deals in
interest rate and equity-based contracts. The two exchanges have been fierce competitors for more than 15
years.

“They compete head-to-head and are each other’s closest competitors," the European Commission said yesterday. “The proposed merger would have eliminated this global competition and created a quasi-monopoly in a number of asset classes, leading to significant harm to derivatives users and the European economy as a whole."

Yesterday’s decision will come as a relief to the London Stock Exchange, which had vigorously opposed the deal. However, the Commission vote is understood to have been closely fought, which could encourage the German bourse to appeal against the ruling.

Deutsche Börse would not be drawn on its intentions, but NYSE Euronext said that the two companies had began talks over terminating their merger agreement. Both exchanges said yesterday that they fundamentally disagreed with the Commission’s decision, having offered to sell assets in an attempt to allay regulators’ concerns.

Manfred Gentz, chairman of the German exchange’s supervisory board, said: “The decision is highly regrettable and very hard to comprehend."

Jan-Michiel Hessels, the chairman of NYSE Euronext, said: “Our merger would have created a high standard for transparency, stability and efficiency in the global capital markets."
America’s regulatory authorities, as well as those in Luxembourg and Germany, had approved the merger. In
Britain, the Financial Services Authority would have had only to approve a change of ownership for Liffe.

Regulators veto exchange;  Deutsche Boerse-NYSE takeover would hurt competition

European Union regulators vetoed Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext's plan to create the world's biggest exchange after concluding that the merger would hurt competition.

The deal would have led to a "near-monopoly" in  European exchange-traded derivatives, the  European Commission said in an emailed statement Wednesday. Any savings would "not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the  merger."

Deutsche Boerse agreed to acquire its New York rival in a deal valued at $9.5 billion US when it was announced last February.
Since then, the value has plum-meted to about $7.45 billion as Deutsche Boerse's shares fell before Wednesday. The companies appealed directly to commission President Jose Manuel Barroso last month to try to salvage their
merger, arguing a ban would harm European exchanges and drive business to other parts of the world.

"This is a black day for Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets," Deutsche Boerse said in a statement.
Deutsche Boerse advanced one per cent to 45.653 euros in Frankfurt trading.

The merger prohibition is the commission's fourth since 2004, when it overhauled its rules for reviewing deals. The ruling can be challenged by the companies in the EU courts.

Appealing a merger decision is an attack on the commission's legal reasoning and doesn't say anything about whether companies intend to resurrect a deal.
NYSE Euronext won't have to pay a breakup fee of $329.8 million, CEO Duncan Niederauer said in an interview
Wednesday.
The exchange will consider its options, he said, declining to comment on whether he will bid for the London Metal
Exchange or LCH. Clearnet Group Ltd.
An appeal of the ruling to the EU courts "is an option going forward," he said.

The EU's antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia blocked the deal "to protect the European economy from the perverse effects of a combination that would have practically eliminated effective competition in the market," he told reporters.

Deutsche Boerse's Eurex, the region's biggest derivatives exchange, and NYSE's Liffe "compete head-to-head and are each other's closest competitor," Almunia said. Exchange-traded derivatives and over-the-counter derivatives are "simply different products," he said, rejecting the companies' arguments that they share the same market.

The Association for Financial Markets in Europe, a group that rep-resents lenders and brokers including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG, said regulators "reached the correct decision" because "potential benefits were undermined" by competition concerns.

Deutsche Boerse's acquisition of NYSE Euronext would have put more than 90 per cent of Europe's exchange-traded derivatives market and about 30 per cent of stock trading in the hands of one company.

European Commission Blocks  Stock Exchange  Merger
James Goundry

2 February 2012

The European Commission yesterday (1 February) blocked a proposed  merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse over concerns that the move would create a “near monopoly” in the trade of European financial derivatives. European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia stated that the  merger “would have led to the worsening of conditions for companies trying to access financial instruments and would have harmed the European economy”. Had the  merger gone ahead, the new entity would have accounted for an estimated 93%
of European options and futures traded on exchange. Deutsche Börse CEO Reto Francioni expressed disappointment at the decision, stating: “This is a black day for Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets.” The decision was welcomed by banks and brokers dealing in financial futures. The announcement was widely expected and followed failed attempted mergers by exchanges in Singapore and Australia in April 2011, and London and Toronto in June 2011.

Significance: The ruling by the Commission came as no surprise. This was reflected in the stock market reaction, with NYSE shares falling only 0.5% and Deutsche Börse rising 1.1%. The failure of a third international stock exchange tie-up in less than a year is likely to signal an end to such attempts in the short term and lead to a focus instead on partnerships and product-specific joint ventures. The decision also reflects the European
Commission's determination to prevent potential monopolies in the financial sector, in line with a belief that lack of effective competition within certain financial sectors in part contributed to the crisis of 2008.

In the financial world's long-running drama of hookups and breakups, the regulators are still playing the dour chaperone. The  European Commission yesterday blocked the  merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, the third failed tie-up of major trading platforms in less than a year. The U.S. Justice Department had blessed the DB/NYSE union, as had both companies' shareholders.

The Commission was concerned that the merged entity would control more than 90% of the market for exchange-traded European derivatives. DB and  NYSE both offered to sell off certain businesses to secure the marriage, and they argued that their increased dominance in certain markets was more than offset by investors' savings in collateral requirements and fees.
The Brussels regulators were unimpressed. Nor were they stirred by the argument that a merged DB/NYSE
would still be small if the much larger market for derivatives traded over-the-counter were included in the relevant
market definition. When the U.S. Justice Department signed off on the merger of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007, it noted that innovation in exchange-traded products
was driven by the prospect of winning business from the off-exchange market.

Even in the realm of exchange-listed options and futures, the Commission's focus on European derivatives seems narrow. In its CME decision, Justice concluded that exchange-traded derivatives were a global business. If investors and managers can choose to flee Europe in the more heavily regulated markets for equities and bonds, it's strange to think that they wouldn't also make choices between Europe and the rest of the world in derivatives markets.

Voices on both sides of the Atlantic have whined about ceding financial prestige to the other ever since the DB/NYSE tie-up was first proposed a year ago. But the Commission's decision will leave the two exchanges vulnerable to dominance from another side of the world entirely. As NYSE Euronext Chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels remarked in an interview with the Journal yesterday: "I would just say that this represents a missed opportunity for capital markets and European capital markets, particularly with regard to markets that are growing in Hong Kong, Singapore and elsewhere."

There are big players in the East who are raising their games. Regulators who think a fragmented market is a better one will soon find themselves leaving major competitors hamstrung in a much tougher and bigger world than they'd counted on.

No Deal: EU Kills Deutsche-NYSE Pact

The rejection by  European regulators of the  merger of German exchange operator  Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext could bring to an end an 18-month world-wide deal boom among stock exchanges that fizzed, and then fizzled.

The planned $18.1 billion tie-up, announced in February 2011, would have created the world's largest combined market for trading stocks and derivatives, marrying the global power of the New York Stock Exchange brand with the derivatives heft of Deutsche Boerse, which runs Europe's biggest market for exchange-listed futures and options.

U.S. antitrust authorities had approved the deal late last year, subject to relatively minor conditions. But on Wednesday, the European Commission, a 27-person body, said the deal would create a "quasi-monopoly" in exchanges' trading of European derivatives.

The doomed deal marks the latest and highest-profile collapse in a year of failed deal making by exchanges, with attempted tie-ups that spanned Asia, North America and the U.K.

It also hampers a march toward globalization of the exchange industry spurred by markets' embrace of electronic trading. While exchanges will likely continue to establish links to one another, a megamarket offering a slate of stocks and derivatives contracts relevant to every corner of the globe appears to face high barriers.

NYSE Euronext Chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said in an interview Wednesday, "This represents a missed opportunity for capital markets."

Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni in a statement called the EU's ruling "wrong" and said it was "a black day for Europe."

Investors in both NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse became skeptical about the deal's prospects months ago. Some believed remaining independent would prove the more-likely path. Wednesday, shares of NYSE Euronext fell slightly, down 0.5% to $26.35 in preliminary data, while shares of Deutsche Boerse rose 1.1% to 45.48 euros ($59.50).

Banks and brokers, some of whom had lobbied heavily against the deal out of concern the merged exchange would gain too much control over trading fees, welcomed the ruling. The deal was "very appropriately rejected by [Brussels] because it would have created a monopoly in Europe in financial futures," said Michael Spencer, chief executive of Icap PLC, the world's largest interdealer broker by trading volume.
The collapse also offers another reminder that the fate of merger activity often rests with government regulators. In 2011, the biggest announced deal of the year -- AT&T Inc.'s proposed takeover of T-Mobile USA, owned by
Deutsche Telekom AG -- collapsed under resistance from the U.S. Justice Department.

Many analysts and investors now expect that exchanges, whose various merger efforts had to confront antitrust concerns, nationalist sentiment and shareholder resistance, will likely take a breather from ambitious deal pursuits.

Instead, the types of failed deals of the past year -- one attempting to join Australian and Singapore exchange groups, another between Canadian and London market operators -- will likely give way to smaller-scale alliances and joint ventures centered on specific markets and securities, analysts say.
Page 30 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer echoed that view Wednesday. "I think in our industry you're seeing a lot of partnerships getting formed," he said in an interview. "With three large-scale, cross-border [exchange] deals
not getting consummated in the last year, the industry has to be realistic about what the prospects are going forward."

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext had pledged to combine their markets and unify trading software, which they said would reduce expenses for both the new company and its customers.

Together, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse are estimated to account for 93% of exchange-based trade in European futures and options, according to research by Tabb Group. Antitrust authorities in Europe fixated on that figure, over the objections of the merger partners, who maintained regulators were overlooking the
much-larger market for customized derivatives traded privately among banks as well as products offered by foreign-based exchanges.
Deutsche Boerse also owns Germany's main stock market. NYSE Euronext owns stock markets in France, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal in addition to New York's Big Board.

The two firm said they plan to terminate their merger agreement following the EU ruling. They may appeal the decision to European courts, Mr. Niederauer said. Any appeal would be aimed not at preserving the deal but at challenging the European authorities' antitrust analysis regarding derivatives trading, in an effort to avoid the precedent in the future, according to people familiar with the matter.
Some shareholders, however, said they were looking forward to moving past the deal drama.

"I'd rather the company get back to business," said Tim Hoyle, director of research for Haverford Investments, an asset-management firm that has held NYSE Euronext shares throughout the merger process.

The collapse also offers another reminder that the fate of merger activity often rests with government regulators. Just last week, the Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint to block Omnicare Inc.'s $440 million unsolicited offer to take over rival PharMerica Corp., which supplies drugs to nursing homes and other long-term
care facilities. The FTC said a merger would decrease competition and increase health-care costs. Omnicare said it disagreed and said a PharMerica deal would benefit consumers.

In recent weeks, exchange executives complained the antitrust review relied too heavily on input from those banks, which have built their own trading venues partly to help bring down their trading costs.

NYSE, Deutsche Börse Officially Pull Deal Plug
By Jacob Bunge

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse AG on Thursday officially ended their yearlong  merger push, abandoning their agreement after the European Union on Wednesday blocked the deal.

Both exchange companies agreed to a "mutual termination" of the  merger plan. Neither party is on the hook to pay the €250 million breakup fee carried by the deal terms, on account of the  merger falling apart due to regulatory pushback.

On Wednesday, the European Commission formally rejected the $17 billion combination on grounds that it would create a "quasi-monopoly" over European exchange-traded derivatives markets.

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse on Thursday continued efforts to unwind the work done on their merger over the past 12 months, including ceasing other regulatory-approval processes, withdrawing filings and dissolving the Netherlands company formed as the exchanges' new parent. The planned entity never got an official name.

Frankfurt-based Deutsche Börse was estimated to have spent €80 million ($105 million) over the course of 2011 in pursuit of the deal, which would have created the world's largest combined operator of stock and derivatives exchanges.
NYSE Euronext had spent $46 million through Sept. 30, 2011, though that figure would have risen substantially
as the exchanges ramped up efforts last autumn to argue the deal's case in Brussels. Fourth-quarter costs linked
to the deal will be released next week when the company reports financial results for the period.

Dissolving the merger agreement gives more financial freedom to both companies. While the business combination was in effect, neither exchange group could make big purchases or sales without the other firm's approval. Consent was also needed if either company wanted to make changes to important contracts, or to alter accounting practices.
Some restrictions will remain in place, however, particularly when it comes to any further deal making.

If either NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Börse strikes a new deal to sell at least a 40% stake to a third party over the next nine months, the other exchange could be due the €250 million breakup fee.

Though no longer pushing to merge, the companies may yet appeal the matter to European courts in an effort to overturn the legal precedent. This decision will be taken after the exchanges review the full response from the EU, which was handed over to the former merger partners Thursday.
The EU's rejection of the deal hinged on the combined power of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext in
European futures and options trading, where together the two firms hold an estimated 93% of such business.

The exchange operators loudly objected to the antitrust verdict, arguing that it disregarded the market in privately traded swap contracts and foreign-based exchanges, both of which represent competition.
The merger was officially unveiled Feb. 15, 2011. Gina Chon contributed to this article.

Feb 2 (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse said they have terminated their  merger plans, following the decision by the European Commission to block the proposed deal.

The transaction that would have created the world's biggest stock exchange operator was cleared by U.S. regulators in December, but was rejected by European anti-trust authorities on Wednesday, making it the fourth among a series of large exchange deals to be blocked over the last year.

The $7.4 billion merger agreement between the two companies was announced nearly a year ago, but the European Commission blocked it saying that the combined entity's "near-monopoly" would make it hard for new players to compete.
NYSE Euronext shares were up marginally at $26.74 in morning trade on Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange.

zz Deal 'not good for competition'

EU regulators have vetoed Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext's plan to create the world's biggest exchange after concluding that the merger would hurt competition.

The deal would have led to a "near-monopoly" in European exchange-traded derivatives, the European Commission said yesterday. "Any efficiencies would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the merger," the commission said.
Deutsche Boerse agreed to acquire the New York Stock Exchange operator in a deal valued at $9.5 billion (about
R74bn) when it was announced in February last year.
Since then, the value has plummeted to about $7.3bn as Deutsche Boerse's shares fell.

The companies appealed to commission president Jose Barroso last month to try to salvage their merger, arguing that a ban would drive business to other parts of the world.

"This is a black day for Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets," Deutsche Boerse said. "The European Commission's decision is based on an unrealistically narrow definition of the market that does no justice to the global nature of competition in the market for derivatives. We therefore regard the decision as wrong."
The merger prohibition is the commission's fourth since 2004, when it overhauled its rules for reviewing deals. Antitrust concerns have thwarted other exchange tie-ups around the world. Nasdaq OMX Group and
IntercontinentalExchange abandoned an unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext after the US Justice Department
threatened to sue.

Singapore Exchange's $8.8bn bid for ASX collapsed after Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said the deal was not in the national interest.

"I fully expect consolidation to continue in the industry," said Richard Perrott, an analyst at Berenberg Bank in London. "This last year was a disaster for the exchanges that wanted to merge, but in this deal it was clear from the start it was going to be tricky. You were looking to combine the two dominant derivatives exchanges in Europe."

The merger would have put more than 90 percent of Europe's exchange-traded derivatives market and about 30 percent of stock trading in the hands of one company.

Deutsche Boerse's Eurex is the region's biggest derivatives exchange, while NYSE's Liffe is the second-largest. They had offered to sell overlapping businesses and give rivals access to post-trade services as they struggled to convince regulators that the merger wouldn't stifle competition in derivatives and clearing.

After the prohibition, they said they would focus on their stand-alone strategies and were negotiating to terminate their merger. NYSE Euronext said it would resume a $550 million stock repurchase programme after reporting earnings next Friday and after formal termination of the deal. - Bloomberg

EU blocks  $10B merger of exchanges
From Our Press Services

BRUSSELS -- The  European Union on Wednesday blocked the Deutsche Boerse's planned merger with NYSE
Euronext, a $10 billion deal that would have created the world's largest financial exchange operator.

The European Commission, the  EU's executive body, said it opposed the merger because the combined exchange would have controlled more than 90 percent of the trading in European derivatives -- complex but highly profitable financial products that allow investors to bet on changes in interest rates or the price of oil.
It said the combined company's dominance would have made it almost impossible for rivals to compete.

"The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide," EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said. "These markets are at the heart of the financial system, and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive."

The decision deals a blow to Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext, which hoped that combining their businesses would have let them compete better with other large exchanges in the U.S. and Asia.

But it also underlines the profound transformation their businesses -- and financial markets as a whole -- have undergone over the past decade. Today, the value of outstanding derivatives contracts has surpassed by many times the value of traditional financial products like stocks and bonds.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext both managed to build highly profitable businesses out of this trend and today own Europe's biggest derivatives exchanges.
To make the merger acceptable, the commission wanted the companies to sell either Deutsche Boerse's Eurex or
NYSE Euronext's Liffe, something they refused.

European regulator vetoes German-US bourse merger

zz Deal 'not good for competition'

EU regulators have vetoed Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext's plan to create the world's biggest exchange after concluding that the merger would hurt competition.

The deal would have led to a "near-monopoly" in European exchange-traded derivatives, the European Commission said yesterday. "Any efficiencies would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the merger," the commission said.
Deutsche Boerse agreed to acquire the New York Stock Exchange operator in a deal valued at $9.5 billion (about
R74bn) when it was announced in February last year.
Since then, the value has plummeted to about $7.3bn as Deutsche Boerse's shares fell.

The companies appealed to commission president Jose Barroso last month to try to salvage their merger, arguing that a ban would drive business to other parts of the world.

"This is a black day for Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets," Deutsche Boerse said. "The European Commission's decision is based on an unrealistically narrow definition of the market that does no justice to the global nature of competition in the market for derivatives. We therefore regard the decision as wrong."
The merger prohibition is the commission's fourth since 2004, when it overhauled its rules for reviewing deals. Antitrust concerns have thwarted other exchange tie-ups around the world. Nasdaq OMX Group and
IntercontinentalExchange abandoned an unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext after the US Justice Department
threatened to sue.

Singapore Exchange's $8.8bn bid for ASX collapsed after Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said the deal was not in the national interest.

"I fully expect consolidation to continue in the industry," said Richard Perrott, an analyst at Berenberg Bank in London. "This last year was a disaster for the exchanges that wanted to merge, but in this deal it was clear from the start it was going to be tricky. You were looking to combine the two dominant derivatives exchanges in Europe."

The merger would have put more than 90 percent of Europe's exchange-traded derivatives market and about 30 percent of stock trading in the hands of one company.

Deutsche Boerse's Eurex is the region's biggest derivatives exchange, while NYSE's Liffe is the second-largest. They had offered to sell overlapping businesses and give rivals access to post-trade services as they struggled to convince regulators that the merger wouldn't stifle competition in derivatives and clearing.

After the prohibition, they said they would focus on their stand-alone strategies and were negotiating to terminate their merger. NYSE Euronext said it would resume a $550 million stock repurchase programme after reporting earnings next Friday and after formal termination of the deal. - Bloomberg

3 February 2012 - US stock exchange operator  NYSE Euronext (NYSE: NYX) and German peer Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) have, by mutual consent, terminated their merger agreement after the European Commission refused to approve the USD9bn (EUR6.8bn) deal.
The decision was announced in a press release issued by  NYSE Euronext.

The companies signed their merger agreement last February, working towards a combination that would have created the biggest stock exchange operator on the planet. However, the concessions they had offered were deemed inadequate by the European Union competition regulator, which said that the deal would produce an entity controlling over 90% of the global trade in European financial derivatives.

1339 GMT [Dow Jones]--Merger-related costs for Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX) will likely total some $221 million, although the deal has been pulled after being blocked by the  EU, RBC analysts estimate. Of this, costs for Deutsche Boerse will be some $131 million, and  NYSE Euronext will have to shoulder the remainder $90 million, roughly in line with the 60:40 ownership of the would-be merged company and spread over the 1Q 2011-1Q 2012 quarters. Costs won't affect valuations or price targets, as they are exceptional and
non-recurring, though important from a cash-flow perspective, the analyst says. Rates NYSE Euronext sector perform, $26.94 target; Deutsche Boerse outperform, EUR47.34 target. Deutsche Boerse down 0.1% at EUR47.30. (ulrike.dauer@dowjones.com)

(SeeNews) – Feb 3, 2012 –  Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) plans to cancel on February 7 the exchange offer made through the joint venture established for its  merger with Nyse Euronext (NYSE:NYX) after the decision of the European Commission to block the alliance of the two stock exchange operators.

As Deutsche Boerse announced yesterday, the exchange offer of holding company Alpha Beta Netherlands NV as of May 4, 2011, will be terminated and the shareholders, who have already accepted the offer and exchanged Deutsche Boerse shares for Alpha Beta ones, will have their shares re-booked.

The custodian banks of the shareholders, who have accepted the offer, will re-book the shares from the so-far tendered shares with ISIN DE000A1KRND6 into the original Deutsche Bank ISIN -- DE0005810055. Together with this, the shares tendered under the ISIN DE000A1KRND6 will be terminated.
On Friday, the shares of Deutsche Boerse had lost 0.26% to EUR 47.160 by 0942 CET on the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange and had fallen by 0.55% to EUR 47.070 by 0931 CET on the online Xetra platform.

NYSE, Deutsche Boerse call off merger after EU pledges to block it; Concerns  about a monopoly in
Europe lead to the scuttling of the $10-billion deal.

The New York Stock Exchange and German exchange Deutsche Boerse called off their planned  merger
Thursday, a day after the  European Union said it would block the union because of concerns about a monopoly.

The two exchanges announced in February 2011 that they would merge in a $10-billion deal. But the  European Commission, the EU's executive body, said the combined company would control 90% of the trading of some financial products in Europe.

The European decision was a blow to the combined dreams of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, the NYSE's parent company. They had hoped to compete better with other large exchanges in the United States and Asia.

In the U.S., the planned merger made waves because it would have meant foreign control of the storied trading floor at 11 Wall St. in New York. Despite political opposition to the deal, it got the green light from regulators in the U.S.
In Europe, however, the regulatory discussions revolved around control.
Some hoped the deal would boost the status of Frankfurt, Germany, as a financial center that would compete with
New York, Hong Kong and London. But regulators worried that it would create a financial behemoth.

The timing of the deal also played a role. Regulators are under great pressure to increase oversight of the financial sector as Europe tries to resolve the huge debt loads of its countries. Adding a complex institution would add to the regulatory burden.

The commission said it would block the deal because the combined company's dominance of the market would have made it almost impossible for competitors to offer rival trading systems.

No challenge  by Deutsche and NYSE Euronext  to merger block
239 words

Banking Newslink
BKNEWS
English
Copyright 2012. Only Strategic Limited.
The European Commission has universally backed the recommendation of Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner to block the merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse. The decision was expected. The commissioner found that 98% of European exchange traded derivatives in Europe occur within the two organisations markets.

NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Börse previously said that they cannot offer any further concessions. On Wednesday a NYSE Euronext press statement announced the two were in discussions to terminate the  merger agreement. On Thursday both markets announced that the  merger deal was terminated. As this was for regulatory reasons no break up fee is payable. It is estimated the two combined spent more than $200m on planning and lobbying for the  merger.

The partners argued that the view of the European derivatives market taken by regulators should include Over The Counter (OTC) derivatives in which case their market share drops down to a more acceptable level. OTC derivatives, as the name suggests are not currently traded on financial markets though plans exist to force some onto the regulated markets in the future. The two Exchanges had agreed to sell off the relatively small single equity derivatives business. They remain able to partner for deals outside of the EU. The benefits of splitting the spoils in such cases may be marginal however.

Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext: Competing arguments
606 words
3 February 2012
Economist Intelligence Unit - Executive Briefing
EXBR
Executive Briefing

English
(C) 2012 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.
What should investors make of faltering  merger plans?

FOR the chief executives of  Deutsche Börse (DB) and NYSE Euronext, this week's hobnobbing in Davos was strictly business. A $9.5 billion plan to unite the two exchanges was derailed in early December when  European Commission staff revealed they were likely to advise blocking it on competition grounds. The exchanges are lobbying hard to persuade the 27  EU commissioners to ignore their staff and approve the deal. A decision is due to be made on February 1st.

On the face of it, investors should support the commission's recommendation to stymie the deal. Its competition wing is mandated to stop mergers that are likely to raise prices, reduce quality or dull innovation. In this case the concern is that the exchanges' derivatives businesses--DB's Eurex and NYSE Euronext's Liffe--would share over
95% of European trading for some assets. There may also be concerns that a merged exchange would be able to force investors to use its clearing facilities (for which it could ratchet up charges) once trades have been made.

But there are reasons to think that the deal could be beneficial to investors. Exchanges are platforms on which buyers and sellers can meet, so a lower number of exchanges, which increases the potential for buyer-seller matches, can be better than a fragmented system. In addition, making all trades on one exchange could lower investors' costs. This is because some assets (gold and equities, say) tend to be negatively correlated, so risks offset each other somewhat. An investor wagering that both gold and equities will go up should need to provide less collateral if a single exchange is used. Economists advising the exchanges estimate investors could reduce collateral-posting by EUR3 billion ($3.9 billion), a likely annual cost saving of roughly EUR300m.

Nor would a merger necessarily mean increases in trading charges. The biggest investors are vital to the exchanges (the five largest NYSE clients make over 20% of total trades). These investors could move to
non-European venues if charges rise, or they could set up their own platforms to deal with each other. And since costs of entry are not prohibitive, plenty of other established exchanges could be tempted into Europe if venues there started to look very profitable. The threats of switching or entry should keep prices to large investors competitive. And since regulators would take a dim view of any price discrimination, small investors should be protected from high charges, too.

If these are all decent points for the exchanges to make, other arguments are weaker. The exchanges suggest regulation will be easier post-merger, so the deal supports financial stability. This is disingenuous. Regulators are wary of mammoth institutions that are too big to handle. And in a crisis some diversity in the system tends to enhance stability.

Nor should investors be particularly impressed by the DB-NYSE argument that Europe must have a unified exchange to compete with large or quickly growing exchanges in Chicago, Hong Kong and Brazil. The idea that competition law should be overridden by industrial policy to create a local champion that exploits economies of scale has often been used in merger cases. But the evidence does not support it: increasing size does not always make a more efficient firm, and governments have a mixed record when it comes to picking winners. The commission should allow the merger only if the benefits for investors stack up, not because Frankfurt is jealous of Chicago.

The Bank of England is forecast to raise its target for asset purchases this week as the debt crisis in  Europe may have already pushed Britain's economy into a second recession. The nine-member monetary policy committee
led by governor Mervyn King will increase its bond purchase programme by £50 billion (R604bn) to £325bn, according to 35 of 51 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Fifteen economists forecast a £75bn increase, and one no change. - Bloomberg

Deutsche Boerse's supervisory board would discuss the role of management, including that of chief executive Reto Francioni, in the failed  merger with NYSE Euronext, Euro am Sonntag reported yesterday. The panel would review the issue at its February 13 meeting and discuss potential consequences, the newspaper said, citing an interview with supervisory board member Johannes Witt, one of the six labour representatives on the board. - Bloomberg

The State Bank of India, the country's biggest lender, would name and shame "wilful" defaulters and put their pictures in newspapers to get them to pay up, the Economic Times said at the weekend. "The fresh approach will ruffle a few feathers," the paper quoted a bank executive as saying. A "wilful defaulter" is one who does not meet payment obligations even when he or she has the funds. Bad loans in India could jump to as much as 5.8 percent of the total within two years. - Reuters

Reto Francioni, CEO of stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse, expects a good year for the company after the merger with Nyse Euronext was banned by the European Commission (EC).

Deutsche Boerse will expand its positions in derivative clearing, risk and security management and will speed up its internationalisation, Francioni said. The company is strong enough to grow even though it will take more time than through the  merger, he added.

Asked whether the special dividend related to the merger with Nyse will be paid out to the shareholders, Francioni said that any information on the matter will be published in the annual report for 2011 on February 13.

(SeeNews) - Feb 6, 2012 - German stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) may launch legal actions against the ban imposed by the  European Commission (EC) on the planned merger with Nyse Euronext (NYSE:NYX).

However, the German company will first closely study the legal aspects of the  EC ban, Deutsche Boerse's CEO Reto Francioni said in an interview with Financial Times Deutschland (FTD).

According to Francioni, Deutsche Boerse will now try to expand its positions in derivative clearing, risk and security management. The German company also plans to step up its growth and internationalisation, the CEO said.

Last week, the EC decided not to approve the merger of the two stock exchange operators due to concerns that it would considerably harm competition. The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE would have created the world's biggest stock exchange operator.

NYSE-Börse saga casts a pall over EU policymaking; I’m still not entirely  convinced by the nationalist argument
Michelle Price
886 words
6 February 2012
Financial News
LONFIN

Dig out the bunting and crack open the champagne, for the deal between  NYSE-Euronext and  Deutsche Börse
is dead.
Joaquin Almunia, the  European competition commissioner, whose department is known as DG Comp, last
Wednesday blocked the landmark  merger arguing it would create a “quasi-monopoly” in the world of
exchange-traded European derivatives. Many in the market are celebrating, and Almunia has not denied himself
the odd gloating aside while speaking to journalists in the wake of the deal. But the outcome has not covered the
Commission – or the European policymaking process – in glory.

There are several elements of the saga that cause concern, the most obvious being the emerging narrative that the deal was killed through a combination of ham-fisted politicking on behalf of NYSE Euronext, combined with a good dose of xenophobia on the part of some member states.

In this narrative, the abrasive, Starbucks-glugging Yanks alienated officials by barging into Brussels and ordering them to rubber-stamp their deal.

One example cited is the exchanges’ attempt to sway the college of Commissioners, who have the final say, by urging them in a letter to oppose Almunia – a move that backfired, say insiders.
But this explanation is a little snobbish. NYSE Euronext, after all, is 50% European. It has plenty of
Rousseau-conversant French-speaking epicures to do the talking if necessary.

Equally curious is the suggestion that – at the same time as the Americans were talking too loudly in Brussels – German domestic regulators conspired to scuttle the deal, fearing the diminution of Frankfurt under the American regime.

This all paints a very depressing picture. If the deal went sour because the exchanges got the European politics wrong, that says more about Europe’s policymaking process – and the lie that is the integrated single market – than it does about the deal. True, it would be even more depressing had the transaction been waved through as the result of a slick lobbying campaign, but the converse scenario is not much better.

I’m not entirely convinced, however, by the nationalist argument. In the final analysis, we have to ask ourselves: who was being influenced? The DG Comp case team is widely understood to be politically neutral. This means that – once the exchanges sensed they were on to a loser – they had to persuade the other commissioners to oppose the decision. But sticking two fingers up at the powerful DG Comp – commonly regarded as a state within a state – is not the done thing. The exchanges’ letter, therefore, was always going to fall, for the most part, on deaf ears.
The strange case of Barnier

This makes the role of Michel Barnier, commissioner for the internal market and services, Europe’s key financial regulator, especially intriguing. He vigorously opposed the DG Comp’s decision to veto the deal but was ultimately overruled. Barnier, of course, is French. He does whatever NYSE Euronext – home of the French bourse – tells him to do, right?

But this does Barnier a disservice. He was sympathetic to the exchanges’ argument that the basis on which DG Comp assessed the deal fundamentally conflicts with the Commission’s broader regulatory agenda. Indeed, DG Comp did not assess the deal in the context of a global market inclusive of over-the-counter derivatives. Yet EU
Page 66 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
legislative material, authored by Barnier’s division, has repeatedly characterised the market as global and envisages the world of exchange-traded and OTC products to exist on a continuum – not as entirely discrete markets.

It is understandable, therefore, that Barnier objected since he believes the DG Comp’s rationale for blocking the deal effectively rides roughshod over a central intellectual plank of his directorate – although DG Comp denies this in its formal statement.

In many respects, the fact that Barnier is French is actually a little inconvenient for NYSE Euronext, since the widespread perception that he has been swayed by a sense of patriotic duty has only served to dilute what is arguably a legitimate grievance.

How do we account for this conflict? At best, it is a case of intellectual dishonesty, at worst a symptom of deep-rooted confusion over the Commission’s financial reform agenda.

There is, however, another interpretation of the ruling. Perhaps, Almunia feels that Barnier’s division has done too little too late to remove competitive barriers to European trading and clearing. Almunia was not prepared to bow, therefore, to Barnier’s vision of the financial markets. If this is the case, then the Commission really is an
institution at war with itself.

Either way, the NYSE-Börse ruling will have far-reaching implications. Europe is limbering up for the mother of all bunfights over the review of the market in financial instruments directive, which aims to transform the way a range of asset classes are traded. And guess which particular issue happens, at the moment, to be the most contentious? That’s right – how the OTC derivatives market is defined and captured.

Listen carefully, and you can hear the sound of European parliamentarians banging their heads on their desks as they leaf through DG Comp’s exposition of the market. They know they are in for a rough ride.

UBS raises Deutsche Boerse’s  target to EUR 58

(SeeNews) – Feb 7, 2012 – UBS kept the “buy” recommendation on German stock exchange operator  Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) and increased its share price target to EUR 58 from EUR 55 after the  European Commission decided to block its  merger with US player  NYSE Euronext (NYSE:NYX).
With the ruling of the Commission, the basic data for the German company got into focus again, analyst Arnaud
Giblat wrote Tuesday.
Giblat considers that Deutsche Boerse’s share price is attractive. Moreover, it could pay out a bonus dividend of
EUR 2.10 (USD 2.77) per share, thus hiking the dividend yield to 10%.
The share price of Deutsche Boerse advanced by 0.39% to EUR 48.590 by 1725 on the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange and added 0.21% to EUR 48.500 by 1729 on the online Xetra platform.

EU Competition: Deutsche Börse And NYSE Euronext  Merger Blocked
Kiran Desai
1,348 words
8 February 2012
Mondaq Business Briefing
BBPUB
English

Originally published February 3, 2012

Keywords:  European Commission, Deutsche Börse, NYSE Euronext,  merger control regime, single stock equity

On 1st February 2012, the European Commission adopted its decision prohibiting the USD 10.2 billion merger between Deutsche Börse (DB) and NYSE Euronext (NYSE). The decision is notable not the least because it is rare for the Commission to block a merger. Only 21 have been blocked compared to the 4,857 transactions that have been notified under the EU's merger control regime since its inception in 1990.
Companies, markets and position

The main issue related to the effect of the transaction on the worldwide market for European financial derivatives (namely, European interest rate, single stock equity and equity index derivatives) traded on exchanges. A derivate is a financial contract whose value is derived from an underlying asset. The Commission found that the merged entity would have held 90% of the shares on this market.

The parties argued that the market also covered non-European financial derivatives as well as derivatives traded outside of stock exchanges (or over the counter). The Commission nonetheless found that exchanges for derivatives based on European underlyings could be separated from other derivatives. As regards trade outside of stock exchanges, considering that the trades on over the counter exchanges are 200 times higher in value on average, in addition to being more risky and customised, compared to exchange derivatives, they were not considered substitutable by consumers, and as such could be excluded from the market.

According to the Commission in this market for exchange derivatives based on European underlyings, Eurex (DB) and Liffe (NYSE) are the two largest exchanges in the world and are each others closest competitors. The competitive pressure exerted by one on the other was considered strong, with customers threatening to switch to the other exchange, which in turn has lead in the past to lower fees. This raised competitive concerns that the parties failed to address, according to the Commission.
Remedies

Most mergers that involve more serious competitive concerns are usually approved after the parties submit remedies to solve the problem that the merger could eventually create. Such remedies are usually divestitures of branches, participations or assets, and behavioural commitments.

In the present case, the parties offered as remedy a series of three commitments (1) divestment of part of Liffe's European single stock derivatives business, (2) access to the merged entity's clearing house for materially "new" interest rate, bond and equity index derivatives contracts, and (3) licences to Eurex's interest rate derivatives trading software. A non-formal remedy was apparently also discussed in the course of proceedings, relating to the public commitment of the merging parties not to increase their prices for three years.

The Commission did not consider the remedies were responsive fully to the competition concern, as they were either too limited, or hard to implement or to monitor. It would appear the Commission wished for either one of Eurex or Liffe exchanges to be fully divested, which both parties considered as going against the economic rationale of the transaction.
Blocked mergers: a rare occurrence

Since the origin of the EU merger control regime, there have only been 21 formal decisions adopted declaring a proposed merger incompatible with the internal market and thus being prohibited as opposed to the several thousand that have been consented to, most of them unconditionally. Over the last seven years, only two other mergers have been blocked, both of those being mergers between airline operators from the same country (Ryan Air/Aer Lingues for Ireland and Olympic/Aegean for Greece), which on their face can be seen to be likely candidates for a prohibition decision, particularly in the light of previous airline merger decisions.

There is little doubt that the Commission decision blocking the merger while the US Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DoJ) authorised it under conditions, will resurrect the issue of consistency when global mergers are at stake. The same issue arose at the time of the GE/Honeywell proposed merger, but the DB/NYSE case is the first case raising such issues to be blocked since the introduction of the latest EU merger regime and the creation of the International Competition Network (ICN).

However, in the present case, due consideration must be given to the fact that the authorities looked at different markets. The US focused on issues on the US markets, and addressed these, most notably by authorizing the merger with remedies in the US cash equity market, by providing for the sale of DB's stake in the fourth largest stock exchange of the US, Direct Edge.

While a transaction conditionally cleared in the US but blocked in the EU is an uncomfortable prospect in terms of business planning, this is an unavoidable risk when it comes to multi-jurisdictional filing in order to respect the territoriality principle.
Policy aspects

Merger decisions have to be taken collectively by the College of (27) EU Commissioners. It is the normal rule that the College follows the assessment of the Commission's competition department (DG COMP) and thus the Competition Commissioner, and validates the decision without question.

After the Commission had set-out its concerns about the merger in the so-called Statement of Objections, the parties launched a series of public statements. They also presented the "European champion" argument but this rarely appears a convincing one in the context of a competition analysis, even in the context of a College decision where some Commissioners might be persuaded to at least consider policy arguments that go beyond competition. However, in the last days preceding the deadline for decision, a notable event was the "reserve" expressed by the Commissioner for the Internal Market, Michel Barnier, who publicly stated he would need more time to assess the dossier for schedule reasons. Considering the importance of the financial sector to the Commissioner's mandate and in the light of the regulatory framework and foreseen or considered reforms and developments in this area, having a single strong entity on the stock exchange might be considered helpful for policy reasons (stakeholder dialogue, monitoring etc.).

While the parties claimed to have the support of a certain number of Member States and Commission officials, it is not publicly known whether there was any opposition to the decision amongst the Commissioners, as the Commissioner responsible for Competition Policy, Joaquin Almunia refused to comment on that point in a speech he gave on the decision, simply stating "What I can say is that we didn't vote".

NYSE outlines plan after failed merger effort

CHICAGO (MarketWatch) — The top executive of  NYSE Euronext on Friday sought to play down near-term threats to the exchange company’s business and direct investors’ attention toward renewed growth plans, on the heels of the Big Board’s scuttled  merger plan with Deutsche Boerse AG.

Efforts in market technology and trade-clearing services are again front and center for  NYSE Euronext (NYX, US)  as the firm grapples with slower trading and the potential of new taxes hitting some of its  European exchanges.
“I’m still glad we tried the Deutsche Boerse merger (DB1, DE) (DBOEF, US) ,” said Chief Executive Duncan
Niederauer on a conference call with analysts Friday.

He said the yearlong effort was now “behind us” after the European Commission last week blocked the combination on antitrust grounds, though he noted that NYSE Euronext was now free to evaluate dealmaking opportunities the company had set aside during its yearlong effort to seal the German merger.

Niederauer on Friday laid out general aspects of a two-year plan aimed at strengthening results as the transatlantic exchange operator reported an almost 19% fall in fourth-quarter net profit. Earnings for the period fell to $110 million from $135 million a year earlier, hit by pre-tax merger expenses and a tax settlement charge. Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $628 million from $613 million.

The main aspects of the plan include cutting expenses, returning capital to shareholders and expanding electronic trading services. NYSE Euronext also aims to restart a postponed project to build its own clearinghouse to serve its European derivatives markets, after shelving the effort during pursuit of the deal with Deutsche Boerse. That strategy will also include a reinvigorated push to capture over-the-counter derivatives business, a major growth area for exchanges that so far has largely eluded NYSE Euronext.

Quarterly results reported Friday were helped by tighter control of expenses, which included $46 million in costs attributed to the failed merger effort. NYSE Euronext anticipates full-year expenses for 2012 to come in below
2011’s total of $1.67 billion, and Niederauer said that the firm would look to trim investments that are not delivering results.

Fourth-quarter net revenue from the exchange’s derivatives unit was $186 million, marginally lower than in the same period last year, including a $1 million hit from currency fluctuations. The company attributed the slight revenue fall to lower European derivatives trading volume, partially offset by higher average net revenue per contract.

Revenue related to information services and technological solutions rose 11% in the fourth quarter to $127 million. The result includes a $9 million gain from currency fluctuations, NYSE Euronext said.

While Niederauer said that France is likely to embrace some manner of “stamp duty” charge linked to financial transactions, in its final form this is not likely to have a big impact on NYSE Euronext’s Paris-based exchange. Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium are also looking at various forms of financial transaction taxes, but a euro zone-wide levy is “increasingly unlikely,” Niederauer said.

Niederauer said he anticipated “double-digit revenue growth” from the NYSE Technologies division this year, which he previously has targeted to deliver $1 billion in annual revenue by 2015.

NYSE Euronext’s three-year-old U.S. futures market, which last year introduced a new clearing function and currently represents a “sizable loss position,” is expected to turn a profit in 2013, according to Chief Financial Officer Michael Geltzeiler.

DEAL COSTS: NYSE Euronext on Friday said costs related to its collapsed  merger with German stock market
Deutsche Boerse shrank fourth-quarter net income.

BLOCKED ASPIRATIONS: CEO Duncan Niederauer said he was "extremely disappointed" with the  European regulator's decision to block the  merger. The failed deal dealt a blow to the company's dream of creating a financial giant able to take on other large exchanges in the U.S. and Asia.

THE NUMBERS: The exchange operator reported net income of $110 million in the three months ended Dec. 31, down from $135 million at the end of 2010. Revenue was flat at $1.05 billion.

8:30 (Dow Jones) NYSE Euronext (NYX) spent $46M in the 4Q in pursuit of now-defunct  merger plan with Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF), matching the $46M the Big Board parent spent on the deal over the first three quarters of last year, according to 4Q results released Friday.  NYSE's $98M total comes in slightly below estimated $105M spent by Deutsche Boerse on the deal last year, but both companies will tally up further costs after they unsuccessfully pressed their case with  EU commissioners in January.

8:13 (Dow Jones) Latin American grains producers should continue to see attractive prices and solid profitability, Credit Suisse says following a crop update by Brazilian food-supply agency Conab. The agency cut forecasts for Brazil's soybean and summer corn harvests, which are in the early stages, because of a La Nina-induced drought. "The positive scenario for the agricultural sector in LatAm has not changed, and a tight supply-demand balance is still expected for both corn and soybean," Credit Suisse says. The bank maintains outperform recommendation for shares of SLC Agricola (SLCJY, SLCE3.BR) and Adecoagro (AGRO). (paul.kiernan@dowjones.com)

8:09 (Dow Jones) With Greece's Laos Party withdrawing support from an economic-reform package needed in exchange for crucial bailout funds, investors are flocking away from risk-based assets and into the safety of the US dollar. It was recently at C$1.0027, compared with C$0.9948 late Thursday while the euro has slid slightly below $1.32. (david.george-cosh@dowjones.com)

8:04 (Dow Jones) Investors are questioning Nuance's (NUAN) growth after the speech-to-text software maker's F1Q results missed Street expectations. NUAN has had delays in meeting milestones that let it recognize revenue from certain contracts, noted CEO Paul Ricci, adding the company is doing larger deals these days that
take longer to close. Several analysts are sympathetic toward NUAN, whose software is widely believed to power Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 4S' Siri feature. "The AAPL/Siri offering is driving spending by other handset manufacturers to 'catch up' in offering voice and contextual search," Needham says. NUAN is down 12% premarket at $26.82 after having risen 21% so far in 2012. (matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com)

7:58 (Dow Jones) Brazil's January consumer inflation of 0.56% would have hit 0.64% if IBGE hadn't changed its calculation method, reducing weight of food and education costs in the index, Espirito Santo Investment Bank BES says. This will reduce inflation by a further 18 bps in February, when tuition fee hikes are concentrated, firm says. Core inflation still running at very high levels, leaving BES skeptical on prospects of IPCA inflation converging on the government's 4.5% target for 2012. The skepticism grows in wake of recent signals that
Brazil's central bank will cut benchmark interest rates to single-digit levels, with two 50 bps cuts foreseen by April. (diana.kinch@dowjones.com)

7:57 (Dow Jones) Raymond James says retailer Furniture Brands' (FBN) "liquidity cushion continues to shrink, tightening the financial noose to a point where there is almost no margin of safety." The comments come after the company reported downbeat 4Q results and more red ink, which helped push shares down 8.5% Thursday. "Clearly, Furniture Brands remains challenged by the economy and its company-specific issues," says Raymond James, noting continued market-share losses as peers Ethan Allen (ETH) and La-Z-Boy (LZB) saw "respectable revenue gains" in their latest quarter. FBN, while down 17% this week, is still up 41% in 2012.

7:51 (Dow Jones) As the 4Q reporting season for coal miners is wrapping up, Arch (ACI) weighs in with its own worse-than-expected performance. Still, CEO Steven Leer said the period's results were "solid...despite weakening coal-market conditions as the fourth quarter progressed. In particular, our Powder River Basin operations rebounded from flood-related disruptions earlier this year" while higher prices and cost-containment helped push margins higher than a year earlier. And like peers, ACI announces output cuts of its own "to better

align with weak generation and coal-demand trends." Shares are down 1.7% premarket at $15.32 after having already slumped 53% the past year. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

7:40 (Dow Jones) With 2012 now here, American Electric Power (AEP) has ratcheted back its profit expectations for the year. The Ohio-based electricity producer and provider had been projecting a EPS range with a $3.25 midpoint since late 2010. But as part of today's meeting with investors, AEP unveils a $3.05-3.25 target and growth of 4-6% annually the next several years "as we continue to invest in our regulated operations, refocus our transmission business and put capital to work on our regulated generating fleet to comply with new" EPA regulations, says CEO Nicholas Akins. AEP, which operates in 11 states, adds the economic outlook in them "remains modest, with slight growth year-over-year expected in industrial and commercial sectors and flat residential" usage. AEP is down 2.2% in light premarket trading at $38.50. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

7:30 (Dow Jones) Let the bickering resume. Greece's political deal aimed at nabbing more bailout cash seems to be short of expectations of other EU finance ministers, and with strikes and protests underway in Athens, European stocks fall, casting a negative vibe in the US premarket. Euro dipped back below $1.32, pulling US stock futures with it. December trade deficit due at 8:30am ET, and Reuters/Univ of Michigan prelim Feb
consumer sentiment out at 9:55am. Gold tumbles almost $25/oz. S&P futures down 11; 10-yr note higher, yield at
1.98%. (john.shipman@dowjones.com)

7:29 (Dow Jones) AllianceBernstein (AB) ended 2011 with a thud as the money manager reported 4Q core EPS far below analysts' estimates amid a bigger-than-expected 20% revenue drop. "While markets partially rebounded from prior lows...trading activity declined sharply," noted CEO Peter Kraus. "With ongoing investment underperformance in our largest equity services, we experienced further client redemptions and ended 2011 with lower assets and a decline in revenues." AB saw a net $13.2B of outflows in 4Q, with institutional investors pulling out much more money than they did in 3Q. The company has seen a steady flow of money leave its funds since
2008, and it happens amid a still-weak environment for US stock funds attracting fresh cash. AB, inactive premarket, is up 26% this year. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

7:19 (Dow Jones) LyondellBasell (LYB) has reported one of the weaker 4Qs in the plastics and chemicals space, as least compared to expectations, as its EPS excluding charges fell well short of analysts' estimates. Like peers, the company noted customers cutting their inventories amid economic uncertainty, hurting volumes in Europe and Asia. CEO Jim Gallogly added that more of the same is expected this quarter while "in recent weeks, we have seen indications that our market environment is improving in the US." LYB shares, inactive premarket, have surged 37% this year. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

7:08 (Dow Jones) LabCorp (LH) is playing cool for now with its 2012 forecast, projecting revenue growth below analysts' consensus estimate. That as the 4Q's top line just missed expectations amid a 1.2% increase in testing volume. That was far below what the medical-testing concern had seen in the rest of 2011 and pulled the year's volume growth down to 3.5%. But LH has had a history of raising expectations as a year moves on, and many companies are taking a cautious stance with their initial 2012 forecasts as the strength of the US economy remains far from certain. LH shares, inactive premarket, are up 5% the past year. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

8:40 (Dow Jones) Despite surprisingly larger-than-expected monthly trade surplus figures for December, the loonie remains relatively unchanged against the US dollar as Greece concerns continue to drive currency markets. Led by a sharp rise in exports, the December merchandise trade report showed a surplus of $2.69 billion, ahead of market expectations of a surplus of $800 million, according to RBC Capital Markets. The US dollar was recently at $1.0025, from C$1.0035 right before the release of the report and C$0.9948 late Friday, according to CQG. (david.george-cosh@dowjones.com)

8:38 (Dow Jones) Buyers came back to the Treasurys market, able to scoop up US debt on the cheap after the recent selloff. Despite cheering the reform deal in Greece, investors realize the country is by no means out of the woods. Euro-zone finance ministers say the Greek Parliament must pass the agreed-upon measures in order to unlock the bailout loan. Benchmark 10-year notes up 18/32 to yield 1.983% -- back below the 2% mark. The
30-year bond is up 1 2/32 to yield 3.146%, recovering nicely after Thursday's mediocre auction. (cynthia.lin@dowjones.com)
8:32 (Dow Jones) True Religion's (TRLG) bad 4Q results and 2012 view came on the same day the jeans
maker's shares hit an all-time high to cap a 69% 1-year surge. That's being unwound in a hurry today, with shares
tumbling 24% premarket to $36.74. Brean Murray downgrades to hold and pulls its $42 price target amid the
markdown impacts TRLG saw. Benchmark also moves to hold, saying, "We do not believe True Religion has a
revenue problem; we believe it has a spending problem." But Needham is holding firm, reiterating its buy rating
and $39 target, calling TRLG "one of the top brand names in premium denim" and saying it is one of the few
"offering compelling merchandise to customers and getting full price for it." (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

8:04 (Dow Jones) Investors are questioning Nuance's (NUAN) growth after the speech-to-text software maker's F1Q results missed Street expectations. NUAN has had delays in meeting milestones that let it recognize revenue from certain contracts, noted CEO Paul Ricci, adding the company is doing larger deals these days that
take longer to close. Several analysts are sympathetic toward NUAN, whose software is widely believed to power Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 4S' Siri feature. "The AAPL/Siri offering is driving spending by other handset manufacturers to 'catch up' in offering voice and contextual search," Needham says. NUAN is down 12% premarket at $26.82 after having risen 21% so far in 2012. (matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com)

7:58 (Dow Jones) Brazil's January consumer inflation of 0.56% would have hit 0.64% if IBGE hadn't changed its calculation method, reducing weight of food and education costs in the index, Espirito Santo Investment Bank BES says. This will reduce inflation by a further 18 bps in February, when tuition fee hikes are concentrated, firm says. Core inflation still running at very high levels, leaving BES skeptical on prospects of IPCA inflation converging on the government's 4.5% target for 2012. The skepticism grows in wake of recent signals that
Brazil's central bank will cut benchmark interest rates to single-digit levels, with two 50 bps cuts foreseen by April. (diana.kinch@dowjones.com)

7:57 (Dow Jones) Raymond James says retailer Furniture Brands' (FBN) "liquidity cushion continues to shrink, tightening the financial noose to a point where there is almost no margin of safety." The comments come after the company reported downbeat 4Q results and more red ink, which helped push shares down 8.5% Thursday. "Clearly, Furniture Brands remains challenged by the economy and its company-specific issues," says Raymond James, noting continued market-share losses as peers Ethan Allen (ETH) and La-Z-Boy (LZB) saw "respectable revenue gains" in their latest quarter. FBN, while down 17% this week, is still up 41% in 2012.

7:51 (Dow Jones) As the 4Q reporting season for coal miners is wrapping up, Arch (ACI) weighs in with its own worse-than-expected performance. Still, CEO Steven Leer said the period's results were "solid...despite weakening coal-market conditions as the fourth quarter progressed. In particular, our Powder River Basin operations rebounded from flood-related disruptions earlier this year" while higher prices and cost-containment helped push margins higher than a year earlier. And like peers, ACI announces output cuts of its own "to better align with weak generation and coal-demand trends." Shares are down 1.7% premarket at $15.32 after having already slumped 53% the past year. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

7:40 (Dow Jones) With 2012 now here, American Electric Power (AEP) has ratcheted back its profit expectations for the year. The Ohio-based electricity producer and provider had been projecting a EPS range with a $3.25 midpoint since late 2010. But as part of today's meeting with investors, AEP unveils a $3.05-3.25 target and growth of 4-6% annually the next several years "as we continue to invest in our regulated operations, refocus our transmission business and put capital to work on our regulated generating fleet to comply with new" EPA regulations, says CEO Nicholas Akins. AEP, which operates in 11 states, adds the economic outlook in them "remains modest, with slight growth year-over-year expected in industrial and commercial sectors and flat residential" usage. AEP is down 2.2% in light premarket trading at $38.50. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

10:02 (Dow Jones) Montreal-based pulp producer Fibrek (FBK.T) gets a white knight in the form of industry giant Mercer (MERC) as the latter reaches a C$170M cash-and-stock deal for FBK.T. It tops a hostile offer from AbitibiBowater (ABH) by about 30%. Trading thus far today has been no lower than the C$1.30 offer price from MERC, potentially showing investor hopes that the bidding for FBK.T isn't done. MERC is down 2.3% at $8.06, worse than the broader market's decline. (carolyn.m.king@dowjones.com)

9:55 (Dow Jones) The TSX in Canada opens with a 100-point drop and worsens from there as Greek concerns sparks across-the-board selling. A big slide in energy and materials shares, the biggest portion of the stock index, helps erase the week's slim gains and puts the resources-heavy TSX in line for the first weekly loss of 2012. "We're back to watching riots on TV and its just a sea of red out there," says Fred Ketchen at Scotia Capital. The TSX is now off 150, or 1.2%. (satish.sarangarajan@dowjones.com)

9:52 (Dow Jones) US stocks take a 2011-like dive at the open as traders pass around some awfully familiar ideas about what a Greek euro-zone exit, or a failure to bail the country out, might mean. "[A] sudden default in Europe would once again raise the prospect of a regional breakup," writes BTIG's Dan Greenhaus. "What effect this
would have on sentiment, prices, financial conditions--and thus economic output--is anyone's guess." Sector action is also shaping up a lot like 2011. Materials, energy and financials fall hardest among the S&P 500 while every Dow component is presently in the red. The DJIA is off 100 at 12790. (brendan.conway@dowjones.com)

9:47 (Dow Jones) The US unemployment rate fell 0.8 percentage points over the last year, but high-yield bonds are still offering 625 basis points of extra yield to Treasurys, a level that is "too wide" by historical standards, according to Moody's Analytics. They suggest the muted response betrays skepticism about the sustainability of positive trends, and of the unemployment rate itself. "The high yield bond market senses that the latest decline by the Labor Department's official jobless rate overstates the actual rise in labor force utilization," Moody's says. (patrick.mcgee@dowjones.com)

9:44 (Dow Jones) A day after Philip Morris's (PM) better-than-expected 4Q report sent shares to an all-time high, Stifel Nicolaus hikes FY12 EPS target to $5.32 from $5.13 on better FX rates vs the firm's modeling and stronger volume growth expectations. Target was also lifted to $88 from $80. PM has indicated 70% of planned price increases this year have already been announced and volume trends are on the upswing. Stifel also touts PM's plan to buyback $6B in shares and $300M in targeted cost savings this year. Still, the firm warns of some risks, including weak global economic conditions, FX volatility and pushback on prices. Shares up a fraction. (john.kell@dowjones.com)

9:44 (Dow Jones) Follow "guidance over growth," the investment bank writes. The recent selloff in Treasurys, first sparked by last Friday's impressive jobs report, has created a good opportunity to pick up notes on the cheap, Citi says. Even with the recent improvement in data, Citi believes the Federal Reserve will continue to reinforce its lower-for-longer rate guidance, which means an anchored three-year yield.

9:44 (Dow Jones) Apple (AAPL) is showing a couple pullback signals on the very-short-term charts. First, AAPL has confirmed a double-top in the 5-minute charts by falling below the low (around $492.40) sandwiched between two highs late Thursday ($496.75 and around $495.40). On the same charts, AAPL is now well below the
50-period moving average (around $494.20), which has acted as support since the start of the week. But before bulls fret too much, there should be support at the minor consolidation area at $485-487, followed by the gap between Wednesday's high and Thursday's low ($476.79-480.56). AAPL is up 0.3% despite today broader market slide at $494.75. (tomi.kilgore@dowjones.com)

9:41 (Dow Jones) France's potential tax on trading is evolving to look more like a "stamp duty," and NYSE Euronext (NYX) CEO Duncan Niederauer tells analysts that a levy is likely to be evenly applied to exchanges and smaller trading venues alike. Such a charge is seen being imposed on trading shares of French companies above a yet-to-be-determined market cap and administered by trade-clearing facilities rather than exchanges, according to NYX. Niederauer is still no fan, but he calls the current concept less "draconian" than what was originally envisioned by politicians. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

9:36 (Dow Jones) Micron's (MU) new CEO kicks off company's analyst day saying will miss previous chief executive but MU is looking forward. Mark Durcan was named CEO on Saturday after prior CEO Steve Appleton died in a plane crash. Appleton's death raised some questions about MU's future, but most analysts expect strategy to remain steady. Durcan today says MU has "way too many good things going on to dwell on the past." MU executives will provide more details about strategy throughout their presentations today. MU off 1.6% to
$8.03. (shara.tibken@dowjones.com)

9:31 (Dow Jones) After spiking in late October, shares of UGGs maker Deckers (DECK) have slumped 28% amid the warm fall and winter in the US. So even as Susquehanna trims its 2012 EPS targets slightly "to reflect anticipated investments (retail stores and international) and material costs (sheepskin)...we find the valuation compelling." The investment bank lowers its price target to $110 from $130 on the reduced profit forecast. Shares are down 2.1% today amid the broader market's slide at $84.18. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

9:24 (Dow Jones) There are many uncertainties in the $25B foreclosure settlement, but Sanford C. Bernstein says the deal is a "positive step toward putting crisis-related issues in the past." The banks currently party to the deal - Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Ally (GMA.XX) - have largely accrued for the costs. The biggest ongoing risks are additional legal challenges the banks could face. While the settlement releases them from some claims, they do not get a pass on mortgage putback claims, securities suits and criminal suits. "We believe the banks have the earnings power and capital to absorb the cost of resolving those issues," Bernstein says. (andrew.r.johnson@dowjones.com)

NYSE CEO eager for megers despite Deutsche Boerse fiasco

Despite the European Commission (EC) scuttling the  merger plan of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Deutsche Boerse AG, the Big Board's boss is keen to look at other  merger and acquisition opportunities around the world.
''There are a lot of near term opportunities in clearing and technology that are getting us pretty excited about
2012,'' Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of the  NYSE told reporters. ''NYSE Technologies will be a significant
contributor to future growth as we aim to become the facilitator and enabler of the capital markets community.''

The EC last week scuppered a $7.4 billion takeover of the NYSE by the German exchange - which would have created the world's largest stock exchange operator - on anti-trust grounds. ''I'm still glad we tried the Deutsche Boerse merger,'' said Niederauer. ''We are in a position to grow the company through strategic mergers and acquisitions. It may not be as easy to do mega, cross-border mergers as we might have once thought but, given our strong balance sheet, there's a lot more we can do.''

NYSE reported a nearly 19 per cent fall in fourth-quarter net profit, to $110 million from $135 million a year ago. Revenues, however, were up at $628 million from $613 million.

The NYSE CEO admitted the exchange was keen on LCH.Clearnet, the European clearing house. ''We're very interested in what happens to that asset,'' he declared. ''As the largest shareholder and largest customer, we see a great deal of potential in LCH.Clearnet.''
The Big Board would expand its US clearing business, besides setting up a full service clearing house in the UK
for listed and over-the-counter derivatives.

Niederauer also expects double-digit revenue growth from the NYSE Technologies division in 2012. He also aims to cut expenses, return capital to shareholders and expand electronic trading services.
Michael Geltzeiler, chief financial officer, said that despite challenging market conditions, the fourth-quarter
results were solid with an increasing contribution from non-trading revenue sources and continued cost discipline.

A leading global operator of financial markets and provider of innovative trading technologies, NYSE Euronext is the holding company and the first cross-border exchange group created by the combination of NYSE Group, Inc. and Euronext N.V in 2007. Its exchanges located in Europe and the US trade equities, futures, options,
fixed-income, and exchange-traded products.

NYSE Euronext's equities markets, which include the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Euronext, NYSE Amex, NYSE Alternext and NYSE Arca, represent one-third of the world's equities trading.

Business
NYSE Sets Road Map as Net Falls
By Jacob Bunge

The top executive of  NYSE Euronext on Friday sought to play down near-term threats to the exchange company's business and direct investors' attention toward renewed growth plans, on the heels of the Big Board's scuttled merger plan with Deutsche Börse AG.

Efforts in market technology and trade-clearing services are again front and center for NYSE Euronext as the company grapples with slower trading and the potential of new taxes hitting some of its European exchanges.

"I'm still glad we tried [the Deutsche Börse merger]," said Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer on a conference call with analysts Friday.

He said the yearlong effort was now "behind us" after the European Commission last week blocked the combination on antitrust grounds, though he noted that NYSE Euronext was now free to evaluate deal-making opportunities the company had set aside during its yearlong effort to seal the German merger.

Mr. Niederauer on Friday laid out general aspects of a two-year plan aimed at strengthening results as the trans-Atlantic exchange operator reported a 19% fall in fourth-quarter net profit. Earnings for the period fell to
$110 million from $135 million a year earlier, hit by pretax merger expenses and a tax settlement charge. Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $628 million from $613 million.

The main aspects of the plan include cutting expenses, returning capital to shareholders and expanding electronic trading services. NYSE Euronext also aims to restart a postponed project to build its own clearinghouse to serve its European derivatives markets, after shelving the effort during pursuit of the deal with Deutsche Börse. That strategy will also include a reinvigorated push to capture over-the-counter derivatives business, a major growth area for exchanges that so far has largely eluded NYSE Euronext.

Quarterly results reported Friday were helped by tighter control of expenses, which included $46 million in costs attributed to the failed merger effort. NYSE Euronext anticipates full-year expenses for 2012 to come in below
2011's total of $1.67 billion, and Mr. Niederauer said that the firm would look to trim investments that aren't delivering results.

Fourth-quarter net revenue from the exchange's derivatives unit was $186 million, marginally lower than in the same period last year, including a $1 million hit from currency fluctuations. The company attributed the slight revenue fall to lower European derivatives trading volume, partially offset by higher average net revenue per contract.

Revenue related to information services and technological solutions rose 11% in the fourth quarter to $127 million. The result includes a $9 million gain from currency fluctuations, NYSE Euronext said.

While Mr. Niederauer said that France is likely to embrace some manner of "stamp duty" charge linked to financial transactions, in its final form this isn't likely to have a big impact on NYSE Euronext's Paris-based exchange. Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium are also looking at various forms of financial transaction taxes, but a euro zone-wide levy is "increasingly unlikely," he said.

Mr. Niederauer said he anticipated "double-digit revenue growth" from the NYSE Technologies division this year, which he previously has targeted to deliver $1 billion in annual revenue by 2015.

NYSE Euronext's three-year-old U.S. futures market, which last year introduced a new clearing function and currently represents a "sizable loss position," is expected to turn a profit in 2013, according to Chief Financial Officer Michael Geltzeiler.

10:13 (Dow Jones) Big Board-held investments in Asian exchanges and European clearinghouse could be on the block as NYSE Euronext (NYX) tightens its belt and moves on without merger partner Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF), according to research note from Susquehanna. NYSE Euronext holds combined $635M in stakes in Qatar Exchange, Commodity Exchange of India and Euroclear, and selling all or part of holdings could fuel further stock buybacks or smaller acquisitions, says Susquehanna, which downgrades NYX to "neutral" Monday. NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer said last week that exchange group would look to trim some investments, though declined to specify which; shares off 1.1% at $28.62. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

10:11 (Dow Jones) Lions Gate (LGF) shares rose 7.5% Friday, an unjustified boost, Caris says, from a fiscal
2013 EBITDA forecast that accounts for the release of "The Hunger Games" and "Twilight 5" in the same year, a
metric that won't be repeated in fiscal 2014. "We are skeptical of the operating cash flow estimates being
promoted by current LGF bulls," firm says, and downgrades LGF to sell from below average. Doubts LGF can
make a profit from planned sale of its TV Guide stake. Shares down 3.2% at $11.46, but still up 83% in the past
12 months. (william.launder@dowjones.com)

10:09 (Dow Jones) As prices rise and commodity-cost increases decelerate, consumer-product companies "should benefit from an improving pricing/commodity cost gap" this year after a difficult 2011, says Morgan Stanley. It picks Colgate (CL) and Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) as the two companies that are most advantaged to capitalize. CL is poised to see a costs ease more than peers while there's less demand changes when it raises prices as it is skewed to personal-care products and emerging markets, says Morgan Stanley. It adds DPS
hedges its costs less than peers, so it would see more advantage from a pullback, but Morgan Stanley notes DPS
is in a tough spot given Pepsi's (PEP) planing marketing-spending hike. (paul.ziobro@dowjones.com)

10:08 (Dow Jones) The $25B foreclosure settlement with the country's five largest mortgage servicers is a "credit negative" for the banks involved, Moody's says. While the dollar amount was within expectation of both the
ratings agency and the banks, the fact that it leaves the companies open to further legal liability is a damper on the deal. "The settlement is narrower than what was originally contemplated when first proposed over a year ago," Moody's says, noting US banks "remain exposed to a host of other mortgage-related issues such as continued high loan-loss provisions, repurchase costs related to bad mortgages...and potential claims related to private or class action lawsuits." (andrew.r.johnson@dowjones.com)

10:05 (Dow Jones) William Blair walks away from a meeting with Walgreen (WAG) management now believing the odds of a contract agreement with pharmacy-benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX) "are less than 50% this year." The firm says it understands there are no talks between WAG-ESRX at this time, and adds it is under the impression neither side has made any meaningful concessions. William Blair advises investors add positions in both large drugstore chains, calling WAG "a higher-risk but higher-reward opportunity," while saying CVS
Caremark (CVS) should see a step-up in PBM market share gains in the '13 selling season that few analysts have modeled. (john.kell@dowjones.com)

10:03 (Dow Jones) Canadian public- and private-pension funds have slashed their exposure to domestic stocks on expectations they generate lower returns. Greenwich Associates says Canadian equities made up 15% of the funds' assets last year, compared with 27% in 2003, and 1/3 say they expect to decrease such exposure further. Canadian pension plans have often been touted as revolutionary in the field, leading the pack with bold, direct investments in companies and shunning private-equity firms as intermediaries. But with funds still just
91%-funded, the pressure is on to extract every single investment gain possible. (amy.or@dowjones.com)

10:00 (Dow Jones) Although Canada's fiscal picture is in pretty good shape, the same can't be said for its biggest province. Ontario faces budget challenges that would be the envy of some southern European countries, but that
Page 94 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
are serious nonetheless for Canada. Late Monday, Ontario Finance Minister Dwight Duncan will deliver a speech centered on eliminating the province's deficit and reforming the delivery of public services. "The austerity proposals won't be Greek-like, but they will be quite severe given the imposing challenges of the natural-resource challenged central Canadian province." says RBC. (karen.johnson@dowjones.com)

10:00 (Dow Jones) Recent muni market strength may be running on "borrowed time," says Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Low supply and high demand supporting the market could "quickly crumble," firm says, noting inflows into muni mutual funds have declined 50% during the last two weeks vs the $1B levels of mid-January. As muni yields have eased, their relative value to Treasurys has also looked less attractive, and 30-day visible supply, while still manageable, is starting to creep higher, firm says. It advocates "selective selling" of 25-to-30 year debt with BBB or lower ratings, in favor of buying single-A rated or higher general obligation or essential service debt. (kelly.nolan@dowjones.com)

9:58 (Dow Jones) A new law that allows municipalities in Pennsylvania to charge a fee on natural gas wells is a credit positive for local governments in the Keystone State, Moody's says. The law, approved by lawmakers last week, is expected to generate more than $210M in revenue in fiscal year 2013, and could boost some counties' annual revenues by up to 50%, Moody's says. New revenue from the fee will depend on the number of drilling sites, so counties in the southwestern and northern portions of the state stand to benefit the most. The new fee comes at a time when growth in other municipal revenues, such as income, sales and property taxes, are stagnant, Moody's says. (mike.cherney@dowjones.com)

9:57 (Dow Jonse) Analysts say passage of the Greek austerity plan was expected and largely priced into the market. So now that there's chatter that the country's meeting with private creditors has been delayed, safe-haven markets are back on the rise today.

ThinkEquity also believes that competitive pressure from EMC is
affecting business in a few more large enterprise accounts, while hard-disk-drive supply and pricing concerns are likely to persist all year. The firm cuts its price target on NTAP to $42 from $54 while Brean Murray recommends investors add to positions if there's weakness after Wednesday's F3Q report, "assuming no material

FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)- German exchange operator Deutsche Boerse AG (DBOEF, DB1.XE) late Monday raised its regular dividend for 2011, added a special dividend and set plans to buy back shares worth up to EUR200 million in the second half, as it resumes a stand-alone strategy after its planned mega-merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX) was derailed by the European Union.

Shareholders will get a regular dividend of EUR2.30 a share for 2011, topped up by a EUR1-a-share special dividend--half the bonus dividend that the company had intended to pay if the failed merger with NYSE Euronext had gone through. The year-ago dividend was EUR2.10 a share.

It also said it will boost 2012 investments in growth initiatives and infrastructure to EUR160 million, up 33% from the previous EUR120 million. The aim is to accelerate the standalone growth strategy that it said is focused on "extending its products and services to currently unregulated and uncollateralized markets; expanding its technological leadership and market data expertise; and increasing its reach into new customer segments and growth regions."
Both Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have to come up with brand-new strategies on their own, after the EU
two weeks ago prohibited the merger plans on antitrust grounds almost a year after they were first announced
and both companies had invested time and energy in bringing those plans to a successful end.

On Friday, NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer outlined the company's detailed stand-alone plan over the next two years, which includes enhancing market technology and expanding trade-processing services both in Europe and the U.S., including a push to win more over-the-counter derivatives business on exchange.

Efforts to cut expenses, return capital to shareholders and further acquisitions to boost revenue growth are also on the table. NYSE Euronext recently reported an almost 19% fall in fourth-quarter net profit to $110 million from
$135 million a year earlier, hit by pre-tax merger expenses and a tax settlement charge. Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $628 million from $613 million.

Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni said: "After the EU Commission's decision, our view is exclusively forward."

"We are uniquely positioned to execute on these strategic objectives and our strategy is in line with changing client needs and the EU's regulatory agenda [following the financial crisis]. Our outlook for 2012 is positive," Francioni added.


Page 96 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The exchange emphasized that key strategic decisions to ensure continued prospering were already taken in
2011: the binding agreement to obtain full control over derivatives exchange Eurex and buying of the majority
stake in the European Energy Exchange.

Deutsche Boerse also issued a new operating cost target of EUR1.2 billion for 2012, which excludes some EUR30 million expected costs related to the failed merger and to restructuring. For 2011, total costs were EUR1.22 billion, down 29% from 2010. The figure includes EUR82.2 million merger-related costs. The higher
year-earlier figure was mainly due to previously announced charges at its U.S. options business, the International
Securities Exchange Inc., and efficiency-boosting measures.

Earnings swung to a net profit in the fourth quarter, reflecting that the business wasn't derailed by the uncertainty over the planned merger with NYSE Euronext.

Quarterly net profit was EUR141.9 million, after a EUR61.2 million net loss a year earlier but shy of analysts' forecast of EUR157 million.

Both year-earlier results, however, were undermined by the charges for ISE. For the full year, the exchange reported a net profit of around EUR848.8 million, more than double the EUR417.8 million in 2010, but also below the EUR864 million Dow Jones Newswires average consensus.
Deutsche Boerse bought back shares worth EUR112 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Deutsche Boerse shares were up in late trading Monday. At 1838 GMT, the shares were trading at EUR49.84, up
2.2% from Monday's close of EUR48.79.

Silvia Quandt Research analyst Christian Muschick called the dividend and the outlook "appropriate," noting that the share buyback scheduled for the second half postpones shareholder participation somewhat but won't be viewed too negatively by investors. He noted that a more concrete strategic guidance "would be desirable."

S&P removes "creditwatch" on Deutsche Boerse after EC ban on merger with Nyse

(SeeNews) - Feb 13, 2012 - S&P today removed the ratings on German stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) from "creditwatch" with negative implications after the  European Commission (EC) banned the planned merger with Nyse Euronext (NYSE:NYX).

In addition,  Deutsche Boerse's 'AA' long-term and 'A-1+' short-term ratings as well as the "stable" outlook have been affirmed.

Deutsche Boerse's ratings were placed on "creditwatch" with negative implications in February as S&P considered that a potential merger with Nyse may have a negative effect on Deutsche Boerse's financial profile. However, these concerns disappeared when the EC decided not to approve the move.

The "stable" outlook reflects S&P's expectations that the German stock exchange operator is again pursuing its strategy as a stand-alone company and that it will continue to report strong profitability.

Despite significant time spent on the failed merger, some important actions were taken in 2011, which further strengthened Deutsche Boerse's business position, S&P added.

NYSE Euronext  roar trails off to a whimper; Exchange fails to break LSE dominance of large international listings
Giles Turner

13 February 2012
Financial News

NYSE Euronext has been looking bruised of late. The  European Commission has blocked its  merger with Deutsche Börse and its London-based unit, set up 18 months ago to attract international listings, has failed to pick up a single issuer since its launch in July 2010.

NYSE Euronext hoped its London venture would challenge the London Stock Exchange’s dominance of large international listings. At the time, Ronald Kent, then  NYSE Euronext’s head of international listings and head of NYSE Euronext London, said: “NYSE Euronext London leverages London’s position as a leading world financial centre.

A listing in the UK enables international issuers to use the City of London’s established ecosystem of internationally minded bankers, lawyers and accountants.”

But according to publicly available data from NYSE Euronext, no firm has listed or issued equity on NYSE Euronext London.

Kent left NYSE in mid-2011 to become chief risk officer at London-based fund manager Aperios Partners, but is now serving the fund as senior adviser.
Diederik Zandstra replaced Kent as head of international listings for Europe, Middle East and Africa, but the title
of head of NYSE Euronext London no longer exists. Zandstra said: “Markets take time to become established and
it is too early to judge at this stage. We have received continued interest.”

NYSE Euronext London was not without its supporters. In a presentation by BNP Paribas Corporate & Investment Banking, published in 2010, and obtained by Financial News, the French bank extolled the virtues of the LSE rival to its Russian clients.

It said: “Lack of familiarity about NYSE Euronext has not generated many precedents of listing by Russian companies but, as Russian companies continue to explore all available routes to raise capital, NYSE Euronext (with its new London platform) offers a number of competitive advantages and attractions… We encourage Russian companies to explore NYSE Euronext and NYSE Euronext London for their capital raising objectives.”
Despite this, the London Stock Exchange has remained the dominant hub of foreign listings. Last year, the LSE
and Hong Kong picked up the flagship mining firm Glencore, which listed for $10bn in last May.

The LSE has also continued to win Russian mandates. Out of the 10 Russian firms that listed in 2011, half opted for London as their market of choice.

NYSE Euronext’s European arm also trailed the LSE. In 2011, NYSE Euronext won 25 IPOs, compared with 105 on the LSE.

But across the Atlantic, NYSE Euronext continued to dominate the US market. For the fifth consecutive year, NYSE Euronext led the American market with 89 US IPOs.

0806 GMT [Dow Jones] DZ Bank says  Deutsche Boerse's (DB1.XE) capital management is favorable, and so is its additional investment in growth. 4Q Ebit comes in below consensus due to higher costs in connection with the failed NYSE Euronext (NYX)merger and an impairment related to the 5% stake in Bombay Exchange. Excluding those one-offs, Ebit is in line with expectations, DZ Bank says. "We welcome the increased regular dividend of EUR2.30 per share," it says, as well as the special dividend which will lead to an overall dividend yield of roughly
6.8%. However, sees limited need to raise its estimates. Keeps a buy rating with a target price of EUR59. Shares closed Monday at EUR48.79. (nicky.redl@dowjones.com)

Deutsche Boerse:Huge Mergers Or Takeovers Not In Current Focus

(c) 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--German exchange operator  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) Tuesday said huge mergers or acquisitions aren't on its current agenda as it outlines its standalone strategy after the planned mega merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX) was nixed by the  European Union earlier this month.

"I am sure it will come as no surprise to you that, in light of a shift in the competition authorities' position away from a global toward a regional market view -- which can be debated but not explained away -- we are not focusing on large-scale mergers and takeovers," Chief Executive Reto Francioni told the annual earnings press conference.

The German exchange had already developed a stand-alone strategy in case the EU prohibited the merger, which it did a year after it was announced.

Francioni outlined the growth strategy, which aims to boost revenue to back to record levels last seen in 2008, when Deutsche Boerse reported revenues of EUR2.46 billion. For 2012, sales revenue in a range of EUR2.35 billion to EUR2.5 billion is targeted.

The increase in sales revenue will be driven by the full acquisition of the 15% Deutsche Boerse doesn't already own in derivatives exchange Eurex, the consolidation of European Energy Exchange from July 1 onward, growth initiatives and partnerships in Asia and Central and Eastern Europe in which it plans to invest. A better linkage of business units and efficient cost management will also contribute to accelerate growth, Francioni said, adding the company doesn't plan to cut jobs.

Deutsche Boerse CEO Sees No Reason To Step Down

(c) 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) Chief Executive Reto Francioni said Tuesday he sees no reason to step down after the company's planned  merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX) failed, having been blocked by the European Union.

"I don't see any reason to take personal consequences, yesterday the entire supervisory unanimously backed me, and the entire management board and our strategy," Francioni said. He added that he plans to fulfill the full term of his contract, which ends in October 2013.
Francioni said he didn't think that Deutsche Boerse or NYSE Euronext made any mistakes during the talks with
EU authorities until the merger plans were stopped.

He called talks with supervisors "constructive" and noted that the plans received "a lot of political support, notably from politicians in Berlin and the Berlin government," which he said wasn't always visible in public.

Francioni reiterated that both companies may reserve the right to challenge the EU's decision in court, once they have completely assessed the EU's legal opinion.

While "the merger topic with NYSE Euronext is completely off the table," other considerations such as potential compensation claims, the market definition and the issue of "appropriate governance" should be taken into account when deciding on a potential challenge in court, Francioni and management board member Andreas Preuss said.

Deutsche Boerse:  Huge Mergers Or Takeovers Not In Current Focus

FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)- German exchange operator  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) Tuesday said huge mergers or acquisitions aren't on its current agenda as it outlines its standalone strategy after the planned mega merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX) was nixed by the  European Union earlier this month.

"I am sure it will come as no surprise to you that, in light of a shift in the competition authorities' position away from a global toward a regional market view -- which can be debated but not explained away -- we are not focusing on large-scale mergers and takeovers," Chief Executive Reto Francioni told the annual earnings press conference.

The German exchange had already developed a stand-alone strategy in case the EU prohibited the merger, which it did a year after it was announced.

Francioni outlined the growth strategy, which aims to boost revenue to back to record levels last seen in 2008, when Deutsche Boerse reported revenues of EUR2.46 billion. For 2012, sales revenue in a range of EUR2.35 billion to EUR2.5 billion is targeted.

The increase in sales revenue will be driven by the full acquisition of the 15% Deutsche Boerse doesn't already own in derivatives exchange Eurex, the consolidation of European Energy Exchange from July 1 onward, growth initiatives and partnerships in Asia and Central and Eastern Europe in which it plans to invest. A better linkage of business units and efficient cost management will also contribute to accelerate growth, Francioni said, adding the company doesn't plan to cut jobs.

Deutsche Boerse CEO: No Reason To Step Down; Plans To Stay Full Term

FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)-  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) Chief Executive Reto Francioni said Tuesday he sees no reason to step down after the company's planned  merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX) failed, having been blocked by the European Union.

"I don't see any reason to take personal consequences, yesterday the entire supervisory unanimously backed me, and the entire management board and our strategy," Francioni said. He added that he plans to fulfill the full term of his contract, which ends in October 2013.
Francioni said he didn't think that Deutsche Boerse or NYSE Euronext made any mistakes during the talks with
EU authorities until the merger plans were stopped.

He called talks with supervisors "constructive" and noted that the plans received "a lot of political support, notably from politicians in Berlin and the Berlin government," which he said wasn't always visible in public.

Francioni reiterated that both companies may reserve the right to challenge the EU's decision in court, once they have completely assessed the EU's legal opinion.

While "the merger topic with NYSE Euronext is completely off the table," other considerations such as potential compensation claims, the market definition and the issue of "appropriate governance" should be taken into account when deciding on a potential challenge in court, Francioni and management board member Andreas Preuss said.

NYSE Euronext; NYSE Euronext  Statement on EU Decision  to Prohibit Merger

2012 FEB 14 - (VerticalNews.com) --  NYSE Euronext announced that in light of the decision by the  European Commission to prohibit its proposed combination with Deutsche Boerse, the companies are in discussions to terminate their  merger agreement.

NYSE Euronext said it would focus on the successful standalone strategy that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders. In that regard,  NYSE Euronext announced its intent to resume a $550 million share repurchase program following the termination of the  merger agreement and after the release of its fourth quarter and 2011 year-end results on February 10, 2012.

Jan-Michiel Hessels, NYSE Euronext Chairman said, "Our merger would have created a high standard for transparency, stability and efficiency in the global capital markets, and we proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction. But as we made clear throughout this process, we would not agree to any concessions that would compromise or undermine the industrial and economic logic of the proposed combination.

"While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on and return our sole focus to executing our compelling existing strategy - a strategy we have continued to implement without missing a beat over the last year.

"The strong underlying fundamentals of our core business, the strength and depth of our management team, and our diversified global footprint give us unique competitive advantages to exploit in the rapidly evolving global landscape as we continue to grow our successful franchises and return capital to shareholders."

Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Officer said: "I'm extremely proud of the efforts of the entire NYSE Euronext team over the last year. While effectively advancing our proposed merger on to the final step, we continued to execute our strategy and deliver the commitments we made to our shareholders.

"While we viewed the merger as a way to accelerate our plans, our existing business model was always central to our strategy. Our business had a strong year, giving us the opportunity to return more capital to our shareholders, as evidenced by today's buy-back announcement.

"We will also take advantage of our financial strength to capture opportunities for growth in derivatives, and through our new initiatives including technology services, NYSE Liffe US/NYPC and post-trade services. And, as always, we will continue the success we have had in optimizing the business through continued cost discipline and operational efficiency.

"In the weeks and months ahead, I look forward to sharing with our investors, employees, customers and partners, the exciting plans we have to continue our growth strategy, build on our reputation as the leading global operator of financial markets and create value for shareholders.

"On behalf of our company, I would like to acknowledge the efforts made by the regulators in our various markets, who worked very hard to accommodate the approval process for our transaction under very tight deadlines."

Finally, I would like to thank our colleagues at Deutsche Boerse for their shared vision of the value we would have created for our customers, shareholders, and employees, and for the significant efforts they made to see the deal through to approval."

German exchange counts  €80m cost of failed merger deal

Deutsche Börse has been hit with a multimillion-pound bill for its ill-fated attempt to merge with its
Americanowned rival  NYSE Euronext.

The Frankfurt-based stock exchange operator said yesterday that the failed tie-up — which in effect was blocked by European regulators this month — had cost it €82.2 million (£68.8 million), including fees paid to investment banking and legal advisers to the deal.

Deutsche Börse had hoped to merge with NYSE Euronext to create the world's largest share and derivatives exchange.

However, the agreed transaction, which was a year in the works, collapsed after the European Commission raised competition concerns about the enlarged group's perceived dominance in the derivatives market.

Deutsche Börse's disclosure yesterday came after NYSE Euronext said last week that it had shelled out $85 million on costs associated with the failed merger.

Despite the bill, the German exchange said that overall costs last year fell by 29 per cent to just over €1.2 billion compared with the previous period, thanks in part to an efficiency drive.

Deutsche Börse said that in spite of the merger setback, it would still be looking to achieve growth in other markets as well as expanding its technology and market-data product lines. It will invest €160 million in growth initiatives and infrastructure this year, compared with €120 million last time.
The exchange reported its best annual sales figures since 2008, when it posted record revenues. Sales for its
2011 financial year rose by 6 per cent to €2.233 billion. Its profits before tax and other items surged 118 per cent
to €1.15 billion.
Deutsche Börse increased the dividend by 10 per cent to €2.3 a share and promised a special payout of a further
€1 a share in May.

Deutsche Boerse still considers lawsuit  against EC's ban on merger with Nyse - report

(SeeNews) - Feb 14, 2012 - German stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) is still considering launching legal actions against the decision of the  European Commission (EC) to block the planned  merger with Nyse Euronext (NYSE:NYX).

A final decision on the matter will be made after a close examination of the legal aspects of the  EC ban, news agency DPA-AFX reported today citing Dutsche Boerse's CEO Reto Francioni.

However, even without merging with Nyse, Deutsche Boerse plans to grow worldwide, mainly via initiating new partnerships, the CEO said.
The company's settlement and custody house Clearstream is expected to raise the share of Asian revenue to
30% by 2016 from currently 20%, Francioni added.

At the beginning of February 2012, the EC decided not to approve the merger of the two stock exchange operators due to concerns that it would considerably harm competition. The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE would have created the world's biggest stock exchange operator.

EU Discussed Extending Deadline For NYSE-D.Boerse Merger Ruling
By Jacob Bunge
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

(c) 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
European Union lawmakers discussed further extending the Feb. 9 deadline for ruling on the proposed  merger of NYSE Euronext (NYX) and Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE, DBOEF) before ultimately choosing to block the deal, according to records of the European Commission's Feb. 1 meeting.

It took policymakers just over an hour to reach a decision on the matter, though some raised questions as to how prohibition of the exchanges'  merger would impact regulators' efforts to shift more off-exchange derivatives trading toward regulated venues, and the prospects for publicly listed companies to raise investment capital in the European Union.

E.U. antitrust examiners led by Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, who was closely involved in weighing the proposed $18 billion deal, determined that combining Europe's two largest derivatives markets by volume would have constituted a monopoly harmful to both customers and potential new exchanges.

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse protested that view, arguing that competition officials should have included in their competitive equation the much-larger market in derivatives that are traded off-exchange, such as
interest-rate swaps.

Minutes of the European Union meeting released this week show that members of the commission did consider the question of such over-the-counter derivatives markets, though in a different way.

Allowing Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext to combine their derivatives units would have made their existing business even more profitable as more off-exchange derivatives shift toward clearinghouses and regulated trading platforms, Almunia told EU commissioners, and would also raise the prospect of a monopoly for users of such markets.

Extending the deadline for deciding the deal -- which had already been pushed back several times from the initial mid-December end-date -- was possible but pointless, according to Almunia. He assured commissioners that he had discussed several times with Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext the only possible remedy that would ease concerns over concentration, namely the sale of one of the company's derivatives exchanges. Both firms had vowed from the start that this step wasn't one they were willing to take.

European Commission members in the end expressed "very broad support" for the decision to block the deal, according to the meeting minutes.

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse had protested that view, arguing that competition officials should have included in their competitive equation the much-larger market in derivatives that are traded off-exchange, such as interest-rate swaps. The Bank for International Settlements estimated the interest-rate swap market's size at
$441.6 billion in notional value as of last June, compared with $76 billion for interest-rate contracts traded on exchanges like those run by NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse.

Minutes of the European Union meeting released this week show that members of the commission did consider the question of such over-the-counter derivatives markets, though in a different way.

European Commission members in the end expressed "very broad support" for the decision to block the deal, according to the meeting minutes. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso urged all members to back the decision to safeguard the body's "credibility."
Spokesmen for Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext declined comment Wednesday.

EU commissioners did weigh the prospect of allowing a European "champion" exchange company to form, which would have provided a leading platform for regional companies to raise capital by tapping a broader public market. The merger partners had promoted their deal as enabling Europe to offer a more-united financial sphere and provide a stronger voice as regulators around the world look to coordinate new rules for trading.

NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer last week spoke of intentions to trim Big Board's investment portfolio as part of broader belt-tightening after  EU's block of  merger with Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF).

10:13 (Dow Jones) More positive US data help keep the weight on Treasurys. The regional Philadelphia Fed factory survey showed manufacturing activity expanding more than expected. This adds to the upbeat mood sparked by this morning's favorable housing and jobless claims reports. Still, the selling isn't as extreme and this encouraging data might suggest. Greece's unfinished debt dealings loom, limiting losses in the safe-haven market. Benchmark 10-year notes down 6/32 to yield 1.953% and 30-year bonds down 8/32 to yield 3.106%. (cynthia.lin@dowjones.com)

10:11 (Dow Jones) Investors dump Avis Budget (CAR) shares a day after the car-rental company reported a surprise 4Q core loss, logging its first bottom-line miss in 10 quarter. Management attempts to reassure investors that there is profit potential in Europe, with CEO Ron Nelson saying the roughly $1B acquisition of Avis Europe was important for brand consistency. He adds European business travel remained relatively stable last quarter, though he conceded economic malaise there hurt leisure-travel spending. CAR stumbles 14% to $12.48 but remains up 17% this year. (john.kell@dowjones.com)

10:08 (Dow Jones) The euro is paring its losses against the dollar and just hit a session high against the yen after news that the German MOF indicates a second Greek bailout will not be delayed until after elections and that the Eurogroup must decide Monday what to do with Greece, according to a Dow Jones source. The source also says Greece wants an extra EUR5 billion as part of a deal and that a PSI offer could start as soon as Feb. 22. Pushing toward a resolution is seen as a positive after no deal was announced following a conference call among finance ministers in the euro zone Wednesday. The euro is at $1.3036 against the dollar and Y102.81 against the yen, according to EBS via CQG. (stephen.bernard@dowjones.com)

10:06 (Dow Jones) PF Chang's (PFCB) lunch menu for its namesake chain will go national in April as the company says tests in Arizona and Dallas showed stellar results. The Bistro has never had a lunch menu, so the smaller portions, faster service and lower prices are liable to jive well the work crowd. Executives say it could even cause a halo effect on dinner. Since PFCB began advertising the lunch menu, traffic rose 20% in those locales. Even though the $10 items left guests spending less per visit, the traffic boost still allowed for 10%
same-store-sales growth. Investors, who were disappointed premarket with PF Chang's 4Q earnings and forecasts, show encouragement by the lunch effort and other initiatives as shares are up 1.6% at $35.20. (annie.gasparro@dowjones.com)

10:04 (Dow Jones) ConocoPhillips (COP) sale of its Vietnam assets for $1.29B comes as no surprise for investors as several analysts saw those assets as non-core for COP. Oppenheimer analyst tells Dow Jones that the next move for COP could be to sell off its assets in China, where the company has faced intense scrutiny after two offshore spills last year. That could help COP to advance in its goal to sell $5B-$10B in assets this year. The company has already sold $10.7B in assets from 2010-2011. Proceeds of asset dispositions are funding COP's share buyback program. Shares off 0.7% at $72.29. (isabel.ordonez@dowjones.com)

9:55 (Dow Jones) Goldman Sachs (GS) would need another $2B for collateral or termination payments if Moody's were to undertake a 2-notch downgrade of the investment bank, as the credit rating warned late Wednesday it might do amid a review of 17 banks and securities firms with global capital markets operations amid diminished
Page 129 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
longer-term profitability prospects. A 1-notch cut at GS would require another $729M million in collateral,
according to its 3Q report; as of Sept. 30 it had $28.3B posted. At a recent conference, GS CFO David Viniar said
he didn't agree with a lot of the things Moody's has said. "We'll be in dialogue with them, as will others, and we'll
see where they come out." GS is down 1% at $112.08. (liz.moyer@dowjones.com)

9:44 (Dow Jones) Private-equity investments in Canada totaled C$11.5B in 2011, up 69% from a year ago, and the highest level in three years, and Canada's Venture Capital and Private Equity Association suggests the robust activity will continue in 2012. "One of the surest signs of renewed Canadian private equity investment has been its across-the-board growth," CVCA says, with investment increasing in "virtually all segments of the market," CVCA says. (ben.dummett@dowjones.com)

9:43 (Dow Jones) PayPal's move into physical merchants has caused anxiety for traditional credit-card companies Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), American Express (AXP) and Discover (DFS). But DFS says the eBay subsidiary has been a growth catalyst for card companies. "I think PayPal has been a positive for the payment industry and the growth of payments," DFS COO Roger Hochschild said at a KBW conference today. PayPal's a "very strong competitor" but also a "very strong partner" to DFS and others. PayPal's test of a service in physical stores has raised eyebrows in the payments industry. A Visa executive criticized the service this week, saying it could pose security risks to customers. (andrew.r.johnson@dowjones.com)

9:39 (Dow Jones) RadioShack's (RSH) 4Q report Tuesday is likely to highlight competitive challenges and weakness in the company's core business, Wedbush says. RSH preannounced weak results last month, saying
its margins suffered from holiday discounting and a larger portion of sales coming from smartphones, which aren't very profitable for the retailer. The results "demonstrate the fragile nature of RadioShack's growth initiatives," Wedbush says, while the traditional techie gadgets the company sells are "available elsewhere at low prices." RSH is down 25% this year. (matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com)

9:37 (Dow Jones) After nearly five weeks of saying investors should buy on dips in the euro-dollar, UBS is suggesting investors sell into any rallies. UBS says the euro should not trade much above $1.3040 to $1.3045 now with uncertainty remaining over Greece. The euro is likely to "continue grinding lower," UBS says in a research note. The euro is at $1.3022 from $1.3068 late Wednesday, according to EBS via CQG. It traded as low as $1.2974 earlier in the global session. (stephen.bernard@dowjones.com)
9:35 (Dow Jones) Slower growth in DirecTV's (DTV) US subscriber base in 4Q was likely the result of
less-aggressive promotion of its NFL Sunday Ticket package, an initial sign that DTV wants to focus more
attention on keeping its most-valuable US customers, ISI's Vijay Jayant tells Dow Jones. "We think the company
will focus on moderating subscriber growth and focusing more on retention." More importantly, 4Q subscriber
gains climbed 56% to 590k in Latin America, where football fans are much more interested in FIFA than the NFL.
DTV rises 1.6% to $47.04 on the company's stronger-than-expected 4Q EPS. (william.launder@dowjones.com)

Moody's  assigns  stable outlook to A3 NYSE Euronext
1,854 words
17 February 2012
Moody's Investors Service Press Release
MOODPR
English
(c) 2012
Moody's changed the outlook on  NYSE Euronext (NYX, senior at A3) rating to stable from positive, following the recent decision by the European Commission to prohibit its planned  merger with Deutsche Boerse. The commission stated that the merger would have created a "near monopoly" in European derivative exchanges. NYX bondholders would have become part of a firm with larger and more diversified cash flows and this drove the original assignment of the positive outlook.
RATINGS RATIONALE

The A3, stable ratings of NYSE Euronext ("NYX") reflects the company's franchise as a diversified exchange holding company - earning revenues from NYSE listings, trading in NYSE and NASDAQ stocks, listing and trading on major European exchanges, the LIFFE derivative market and an expanding technology business. Despite the cancellation of the merger, NYX has performed well for bondholders recently reducing debt by $365 million in 2011.

Management's strategic decisions regarding pursuit of consolidation opportunities and return of capital to shareholders will remain important rating drivers. NYX announced that it would reactivate the $550 million still available under its share repurchase program and has said it will continue to selectively pursue acquisition opportunities. Management also communicated a target to maintain DEBT/EBITDA leverage of approximately 2x, which is near the maximum leverage that Moody's thinks as appropriate for an A3 rating. "The disapproval of the Deutsche Boerse merger will cause NYX management to reconsider its growth options and future acquisitions
and leverage increases cannot be ruled out" said Peter Nerby a Moody's Senior Vice-President.
NYX reported net income of $619 million in 2011.
The principal methodology used in this rating was Global Securities Industry Methodology published in December
2006. Please see the Credit Policy page on  www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.
REGULATORY DISCLOSURES

Although this credit rating has been issued in a non-EU country which has not been recognized as endorsable at this date, this credit rating is deemed "EU qualified by extension" and may still be used by financial institutions for regulatory purposes until 30 April 2012. Further information on the EU endorsement status and on the Moody's office that has issued a particular Credit Rating is available on  www.moodys.com.

For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, this announcement provides relevant regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series or category/class
of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, this announcement provides relevant regulatory disclosures in relation to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating.

New York’s blocked exchange

At this point, Duncan Niederauer needs to make a deal. And almost any deal will do. The New York Stock Exchange CEO is wooing the London Metal Exchange after regulators in  Europe deep-sixed his proposed merger with Deutsche Börse earlier this month. The LME is the top futures market for industrial metals such as copper and zinc, so it certainly would be a prize for Mr. Niederauer, and there are savings to be had from combining operations with the  NYSE’s London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. Bidding reportedly has started at 1 billion pounds.

Trouble is, Mr. Niederauer is poorly positioned to win the bidding war that is already emerging. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange are also said to be vying for the metals mart. And both of these futures exchanges bring greater heft to the table: The Chicago exchange group’s market value is $19
billion, more than double the NYSE’s $7.6 billion, while the ICE is valued at $10 billion.

Based on last week’s share prices, investors are paying around $16 for each dollar of earnings generated by the CME and the ICE, while the NYSE’s price-to-earnings multiple is only 11. That price/earnings gap is largely explained by the fact that the NYSE’s bedrock business of stock trading is much less profitable than futures trading.

In addition, the NYSE’s market share is shrinking. Its share of U.S. stock trading recently fell to a record low 24%. The decline, going on for many years now, is a big reason why Mr. Niederauer wanted to team up with Deutsche Börse. It’s also why shares in his exchange’s parent, NYSE Euronext, have fallen around 17% over the past 12 months, triple the rate of decline in the Bloomberg World Exchanges Index.

The NYSE remains the premier name in the exchange world, of course. Proof of that came when the much-larger Deutsche Börse agreed last year to make Mr. Niederauer CEO of the combined company and keep its headquarters in New York. But unless Mr. Niederauer can do something to perk up his business quickly, the next time a merger partner comes calling, he won’t be in a position to dictate the terms.
The end, it seems, of Ron vs. Don
The bitter fight between Ronald Perelman and Donald Drapkin is at last over.

The former close friends and partners at Mr. Perelman’s conglomerate, MacAndrews & Forbes, went to trial last month after Mr. Drapkin sued for $16 million in unpaid compensation. Mr. Perelman’s side argued that Mr.
Drapkin stole confidential information and wasn’t owed a cent. It took a jury about an hour to rule that Mr. Drapkin deserved the $16 million.

Last week, the parties said they reached a settlement. Terms weren’t disclosed, but since there was other litigation between the two that wasn’t dealt with at the trial, it seems likely that Mr. Drapkin is walking away with more than the amount awarded by the jury. An attorney for Mr. Drapkin wouldn’t comment, beyond stating that all disputes between the parties are now resolved.

Mr. Perelman extracted one big concession from his former partner. The settlement declares: “The parties agree there was a substantive error in the Judgment and that the Judgment should be vacated.”


Page 135 of 145 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So, should anyone ask Mr. Perelman about this episode, he can say he got his adversary to agree that the jurors made a mistake and to have their verdict wiped off the books. That is certainly one type of vindication.

OPEN FORUM : DEUTSCHE BÖRSE-NYSE EURONEXTMERGER: EU'S REFUSAL NOT APPROPRIATE
By Jean-Paul Gauzès

The birth of a financial champion resulting from the  merger of Deutsche Börse (the Frankfurt exchange) and
NYSE Euronext (New York, Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon) will not be taking place, at least not now.
On 1 February 2012, the  European Commission ruled out the  merger.

The executive, based on the EU merger regulation, objected to the proposed merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext on the ground that it would have created a virtual monopoly for international stock market transactions on European derivatives. The two exchanges together control more than 90% of global transactions on such products.

The Commission's investigation showed that new competitors would stand little chance of gaining a sufficient foothold on the market to represent a credible competitive threat to the merged entity. The two companies concerned proposed to dispose of certain of their assets and offer access to their clearing house for certain categories of new contracts. The Commission nevertheless found that these commitments were not sufficient to address the competition problems it anticipated.
The decision, debated by the College of Commissioners, did not obtain unanimous support.

I for one consider that the merger would have created a coherent and strategic entity. It would have offered new opportunities for European activities. The reason given by Brussels is inappropriate at a time when Europe's efforts are moving in the direction of strengthening derivatives regulations.

The relevant market in this respect cannot be limited to Europe alone. The outlook has to be global. Given the current balance of power in the world, the European Commission's mistrust of entities that could be European champions is undoubtedly detrimental.

The economic and financial crisis has shown that Europe needs to seek two objectives: on the one hand, to ensure that the financial system serves the real economy and on the other, to strengthen Europe's voice in the international arena.

These two objectives can be achieved only if we prove ourselves capable of protecting and strengthening Europe's competitive advantages and if we create stable, transparent and solid economic and financial infrastructures capable of financing the European economic recovery.

Established in Europe, this structure could have been effectively supervised by European regulators, which would have boosted market security and stability.

The merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would have offered a unique opportunity to create a platform in Europe and would have helped us achieve our goals of enhancing the security and stability of European financial markets. That would have made Europe more competitive as a financial centre and would certainly have given European companies easier access to liquidities in today's context of tight capital, which jeopardises the relaunch of the European economy.

NYSE-DB merger down in flames; DEAD BEFORE ARRIVAL

Although the last couple of years have seen a number of cross-border exchange mergers announced, slowly but surely they have fallen by the wayside. After a year-long courtship, the largest proposed  merger has collapsed, with the  European Commission

blocking the merger of NYSE Euronext with Deutsche Börse
.

Will Rhode, senior analyst at Tabb Group, says he initially expected the merger to be approved but things changed. “It was one of those things that snowballed. Over the December-January period, everything went south very quickly,” he says.

The European Commission formally rejected the merger on Feb. 1, citing competition concerns. In its decision, the Commission said that in the market for exchange derivatives based on European underlyings, Eurex (Deutsche Börse) and Liffe (NYSE) are the two largest exchanges in the world and each other’s closest competitor.

“The European Commission has been working toward competition in most aspects of trading,” says Simmy Grewal, senior analyst at Aite Group. “A combined NYSE-Deutsche Börse would have created a dominant entity, basically a monopoly, in the derivatives space.”

Unlike other proposed multinational mergers, nationalistic sentiment did not become an issue, Rhode says. “There was a distinctly muted response to this merger. This raised suspicion in Europe about [who was acquiring whom],” he says.

Some analysts were concerned that the merger was more a stealth initiative by NYSE into the European market, rather than Deutsche Börse acquiring NYSE.

Considering the route that regulatory reform is taking around the globe, Rhode calls it a “strange coincidence” that the merger got called off at the same time that we’re seeing exchanges become more regional because of
over-the-counter regulatory reform. “It might be that regional exchanges take better to that kind of a trend than a global exchange does. We’re not seeing the market become more global, we’re seeing it become more regional,” he says.

Still, Grewal expects other multinational exchange mergers in the future, particularly as the Asian marketplace grows. “It is something that’s the future of trading, but we’re not there yet. People aren’t comfortable letting go of their national treasures,” she says.

End-users had looked forward to the potential for efficiencies if the merger had occurred, but Grewal points out that most brokers already have connections to both NYSE-Euronext and Deutsche Börse.

Neither company’s stock was affected seriously by the news. “[Stockholders] were pretty aware that there were regulatory issues,” Grewal says.

3:56 (Dow Jones) Pressure on  European economies and institutions nothing new for 2012, but  NYSE Euronext (NYX) CEO Duncan Niederauer sees little hope for clouds over  Europe's trading sector to part this year. "The businesses in Europe we have are good businesses, but we can't count on them for a lot of growth in the
near-term," Niederauer says in CNBC interview today. "In 2012, it's going to be steady as she goes at best." So maybe a good thing, then, that  EU blocked NYSE's merger with Germany's Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF), a deal that would have deepened the combined firm's reliance on European markets.

"We've been fortunate that several have stepped up" McCallister says at Citigroup conference, regarding potential partners. There are a handful of insurers that specialize in Medicaid and could be big beneficiaries in push to serve so-called dual eligibles. Asked how HUM can compete for partners, McCallister turns it around by asking where companies will go when looking for Medicare expertise. "I think we're

3:50 (Dow Jones) Sprint (S) would keep at least $236M of the $310M in advance payments it received from LightSquared if it walks away from a deal with the wireless venture to share network-building costs. S can terminate its 15-year deal with hedge-fund manager Phil Falcone's LightSquared any time between March 16 and April 30 for any reason, according to the carrier's 2011 report. LightSquared is being blocked by the FCC from building out a 4G network on concerns it interferes with GPS signals. S says it would have to repay $65M if the deal ends next month, and possibly another $9 million, pending some contractual provisions. LightSquared could extend the deadline for when S can terminate their agreement to between June 25 and year end, if it gets lender support. (greg.bensinger@dowjones.com)

3:36 (Dow Jones) DJIA is once again courting its first close above 13000 since May 19, 2008, up 26 to 13009
with less than 30 minutes left in the session. DJIA topped the round number last week, but so far has hasn't found
traction above the level on a closing basis. So what? While many don't give too much credence to blue chips at
big, round numbers, there could be some psychological steam to be had from finally notching the close. "I think
it's just a short-term boost, but there's some psychological aspects of that, like the news of a Facebook IPO. It
conforms to the trend that investors are feeling better about things, and basically that's what we're seeing more
than anything else right now," says Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates.

3:36 (Dow Jones) Odd confluence of price action today, as a variety of different assets that typically don't move in the same direction all sport gains. So far, US stocks are higher, along with Treasurys, USD dollar and even the VIX volatility index, which typically retreat when stocks climb. Treasurys 10-yr note rose 18/32, yield down to
1.92%. VIX recently up 3.8% at $17.97. USD index up 0.2%. DJIA up 25; Nasdaq up 8; S&P 500 climbs 4. One notable that fell -- Nymex crude, down $1.21 to $108.56. (john.shipman@dowjones.com)

(DISCA) to neutral while lowering Viacom (VIA) to neutral. Goldman likes the growth in ESPN revenue and projected improvement at the DIS amusement parks. As for NWSA--which owns Dow Jones--the investment bank calls it "among the cheapest stocks" amid the big media companies "despite having the fastest EPS growth."
While DISCA's upgrade follows multiple compression during the last year, VIA's downgrade comes amid the ratings decline at Nickelodeon and MTV--the company's 2 biggest networks. VIA is down 0.9% while DIS gains
1.1%. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

3:25 (Dow Jones) UPS doesn't mention TNT Express (TNTE.AE) in its 2011 annual report, filed today with the SEC, but it does make clear why it covets the Dutch shipping company. "Europe, our largest region outside of the US, accounts for roughly half of international revenue and is one of our growth engines." UPS adds it sees "continued strong potential for growth in small-package exports in Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands." TNT rejected a $6.5B bid from UPS about two weeks ago, but both sides have said talks are ongoing. UPS notes "the highly fragmented nature" of Europe's market; buying TNT would give UPS the biggest share of the continent's express market. (bob.sechler@dowjones.com)
3:22 (Dow Jones) TranS1 (TSON) shares are recouping much of the month's declines as Canaccord upgrades
the spinal-device company to buy and boosts its price target 17% to $3.50. It says "expectations have been reset"
for the company the past 6 months amid a federal investigation while "we believe TranS1 is reaching an inflection
point in its reimbursement initiatives." All told, Canaccord says, "The stock is currently oversold and any positive
reimbursement or strategic events will present significant upside." TSON has gained 14% today to $2.81, cutting
this month's slide to 4.4%. It's also up 51% this year. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

3:18 (Dow Jones) Fiera Sceptre (FSX.T) is open to acquisitions in the US, particularly those that offer emerging markets products Jean-Guy Desjardins, chief executive of the independent investment management firm, said on an analyst call. "We don't have emerging strategy," said Fiera, adding that the firm will be "excited" if an opportunity to build with people, or acquire a firm, will come up in the US. Fiera just opened its first US office in Boston, Mass., last fall. The Montreal-based firm just announced plans to acquire Natcan Investment Management from National Bank of Canada (NA.T), which will make it the fourth largest independent asset manager in the country.

3:12 (Dow Jones) Brazilian meat packer Marfrig Alimentos (MRFG3.BR, MRRTY) extends gains on news it expects to generate up to 330 million Brazilian reais ($193.3 million) in synergies from a corporate restructuring. Marfrig plans to separate its beef divisions from pork, poultry and processed foods in two big operating units, while putting company administration, finance and human resources under the same roof. Banco do Brasil analysts say the move "makes sense." In Sao Paulo, Marfrig lately up 7% at BRL9.88. (paul.kiernan@dowjones.com)

3:00 (Dow Jones) Cyberonics (CYBX) adds to Friday's 7.8% gain following better than expected fiscal 3Q results, rising 4.9% to $38.83. Dougherty & Co. raises its price target to $43 from $34 on expectations for improved earnings and an expanding core epilepsy business. Firm sticks with its buy rating and notes "strong market development activities in Japan, that mirrors some of the successful programs implemented in US and Europe." Firm also says ongoing discussions to allow Medicare reimbursement for use CYBX's pacemaker-like implant as
a treatment for severe depression remains a wild card. (patrick.sullivan@dowjones.com)

Closed For Stock-Taking: The European Commission's Prohibition Decision  In Deutsche Börse/ NYSE Euronext

28 February 2012

On 1 February, the European Commission ("Commission") announced that it had decided to prohibit the proposed merger between Deutsche Börse ("DB") and  NYSE Euronext ("NYSE").

Commission merger prohibition decisions are particularly rare. There have been a total of 21 prohibition decisions since the EU Merger Regulation first entered into force on 21 September 1990. The two most recent prohibition decisions concerned the proposed Ryanair/Aer Lingus and Olympic/Aegean mergers. However, as the statistic indicates, the risk of outright prohibition should be seen as extremely marginal when weighed against the total number of cases (in excess of 4,500) reviewed by the Commission.
Relevant market and the position of the parties

DB and NYSE operate the two largest exchanges for European financial derivatives in the world: Eurex and LIFFE. The Commission opined that the proposed merger would have resulted in a quasi-monopoly in European financial derivatives, where, in the Commission's view, DB and NYSE together control more than 90 per cent of the global market.

Derivatives are financial contracts traded on financial markets used to transfer risk and whose value is derived from an underlying variable or asset, such as stocks, interest rates or currencies. They are typically used for investment purposes, hedging and overall risk management in the financial markets. They can be traded on exchanges or over-the-counter ("OTC").

The Commission's market investigation assessed the extent to which customers of European financial derivatives switch between exchange-traded and OTC derivatives. The evidence collated by the Commission, including the parties' own documents, showed that exchange traded and OTC derivatives had different characteristics and fulfilled different customer demands.

Exchange traded derivatives are highly liquid, are traded in relatively small sizes (approximately €100,000 per trade) and use fully-standardised contracts. OTC derivatives typically concern much bigger transactions (approximately €200 million per trade) that allow full customisation of their legal and economic terms and conditions, tailored to the customer's requirements. When a contract is available on exchange, derivatives users generally prefer this execution as it is much cheaper than OTC.

The Commission also pointed to a White Paper published by DB in 2008, which suggested that trading the same contract OTC is up to eight times more expensive. In the Commission's view, this is why derivatives users would not switch from exchange traded to OTC if the merged entity were to increase trading fees. Further, there is an ever growing category of customers for which an exchange is the only option as, for various reasons, they cannot and would not trade OTC.
Barriers to entry and competitive constraints

The Commission considered that due to the "closed vertical silo" operated by LIFFE and Eurex (where the exchange's trading is exclusively linked to a clearing house), there were major barriers to entry.

As regards the degree of actual or potential competition from other exchanges, the Commission considered it unlikely that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ("CME") would become a credible competitive force in the area. It opined that CME would face considerable obstacles as, owing to its very different product portfolio, it would not be in a position to offer collateral savings comparable to those offered by the parties individually or the merged

entity in the product area concerned. The Commission concluded that there was no prospect for CME, or any other new player, to exercise a meaningful competitive constraint on the two companies, DB/NYSE, in the products concerned in the foreseeable future.
Remedies to address competition concerns

Where a proposed merger raises more serious competition concerns, the parties' typically offer remedies in order to address those concerns. Such remedies may be structural (e.g. a divestment) or behavioural in nature.
The parties offered a remedy package that consisted of three parts:
a divestment of a part of LIFFE's European single stock derivatives business;

access to the merged entity's clearing house for a materially new interest rate, bond and equity index derivatives contracts; and
a licence to Eurex's interest rate derivatives trading software.

However the Commission, based on its market testing, considered that this remedy package would be insufficient in scope, difficult to implement and unlikely to be effective in practice. Although it was never offered as a formal commitment, the Commission also took note of the parties' pledge not to increase prices, but considered that as the pledge concerned list prices, it would be ineffective in practice, as actual prices in the market are often based on rebates. In addition, any such behavioural commitment would be difficult to implement and monitor and its relevance therefore in the Commission's view was limited.
European champion and International cooperation

The Commission appeared unconvinced by the "European champion" policy argument raised by the parties. Such an argument gains little traction within a competition analysis. In this case, the Commission stated that the
creation of a European champion at the expense of entrenching a monopoly with market power would not be beneficial for the European economy or for European consumers.

Given that the proposed merger was cleared subject to conditions by the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice ("DoJ"), the Commissions' decision will reignite the debate vis-à-vis consistency of assessment when global mergers are at stake. There appears to have been a degree of interaction between the Commission and the DoJ in the current case. However, it must be noted that the Commission and the DoJ looked at different markets and focussed on different issues. While the Commission was concerned about derivatives based on European underlyings, the DoJ saw some issues in the US cash equity markets, ultimately requiring DB to divest its interest in the Direct Edge stock exchange.
Conclusion

The Commission is seeking to move what it perceives to be opaque and risky OTC derivatives onto clearing houses and exchanges, while also ensuring access to clearing in order to guarantee an open derivatives market with many players. It is clear that the Commission considers its decision in this case to be consistent with its overarching regulatory objectives.
The decision once again highlights the importance of the parties' documents within the assessment process - the
Commission in this case relying on a DB document to support its decision.

The merger is the latest in a line of deals to crumble. For example, the proposed merger between the groups that control the London Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange was abandoned last June, clearing the way for a fresh bid for the Toronto Stock Exchange by the Maple Acquisition Group, a consortium of Canadian banks and financial firms. The deal is still awaiting regulatory approval at the time of writing. Last April, Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan formally rejected the proposed tie-up between stock exchange operators ASX Ltd, and Singapore Exchange Ltd., stating that the decision was based on clear, unambiguous advice from the Foreign Investment Review Board that the takeover would be contrary to national interests.

European Union regulators vetoed Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext's plan to create the world's biggest exchange after concluding that the merger would hurt competition. The deal would have led to a "near-monopoly" in European exchange-traded derivatives, the  European Commission ruled recently, adding that any savings would "not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the  merger". Deutsche Boerse had agreed to acquire its New York rival in a deal valued at $9.5 billion last February.
