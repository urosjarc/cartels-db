PARIS -(Dow Jones)-  European Union competition authorities have reached an "informal agreement" with the management of electrical equipment makers  Schneider  Electric SA (F.SCN) and  Legrand SA (F.LGR) on divestments necessary to win regulatory approval for their merger, La Tribune reports. The agreement calls for Legrand to make divestments worth 10%-15% of its business, and lesser divestments by  Schneider,  La Tribune says.

Schneider  outlook seen cloudy  post merger, H1 stable.

Reuters News

English
(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
PARIS, Sept 17 (Reuters) -  Schneider  Electric SA and its planned takeover target  Legrand SA plan to announce their half-year earnings at the same news conference on Tuesday, showing confidence that their 6.42 billion euro ($6 billion) merger will go ahead.

But doubts remain about the extent of concessions that the  European Commission will demand of the two French electrical equipment makers. And while analysts forecast a stable first half, they expressed doubts about the profit outlook in the weakening economic climate.

Schneider holds 98.1 percent of Legrand stock after it launched a friendly bid in January. It has said it expects to have to sell businesses worth between 150 million and 500 million euros and is likely to obtain approval in
mid-October.

"If Brussels demands divestitures, the least one can say is that current market conditions are not favourable to that type of operation (the sale of assets)," said an analyst who asked not to be named.

This week, Schneider is likely to report first-half net profit of 280 million euros, down from 285 million euros a year earlier, according to the median forecast of seven analysts polled by Reuters. The forecasts ranged from 270 million to 282 million.

Operating profit is expected to be little changed at 605 million euros, in line with a company forecast made in mid-July.

"Given the differing levels of profitability in the different zones and the weakness of sales in North America, an operating result at the same level as that of the first half of 2000 is expected," Schneider said at the time.

"Unless there is a sharp change in the market, the year as a whole should show moderate growth," the company added. It has already said that first-half revenue rose 7.7 percent to 4.93 billion euros.

"We're mainly hoping Schneider will provide indications about the industrial outlook, principally in the United States, and also about sales of equipment for the residential sector," said another analyst, who requested anonymity.

In the United States, "while the group has pointed out that many distributors have called a halt to destocking, this could be merely a pause in a longer-term decline in the market for industrial and construction materials," said Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in a note to investors.

Legrand is also expected to post stable half-year results compared with the first six months of 2000, when it posted net profit before goodwill of 228 million euros.

On July 19, the Limoges-based maker of household plugs, sockets and light switches reported a 21.5 percent rise in first-half turnover to 1.6 billion euros and forecast "moderate growth in its operating result before goodwill
write-downs."

Looking beyond the first half, the possibility that the European Commission will demand the sale of important activities before it approves the tie-up clouds the outlook for the combined company, analysts said.

PARIS, Sept 27 (Reuters) - The planned merger between French electrical equipment maker  Schneider  Electric and peer Legrand hit a snag on Thursday after the companies said the  European Commission's Merger Task Force issued a negative view on the bid.

Schneider  and Legrand , who showed their faith in a friendly 6.42 billion euro ($5.91 billion) tie-up with a joint half-year results news conference this month, said in a statement they were taken by surprise by the move.

"For both companies, this development is completely unexpected and incomprehensible," they said. "Discussions with the MTF (Merger Task Force), which led to a number of commitments from Schneider Electrical and
Legrand, gave every indication the merger would be approved."
They said that European commissioners would hand down a final decision on the merger on October 17. An EU Commission spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
Schneider and Legrand had been confident of winning the Commission's approval for their planned union which aims to create the world's largest maker of low-voltage electrical equipment.

"Given that all the necessary concessions have been made to provide a clear, durable solution to the statement of objections, rejection of the merger would be completely incomprehensible," they said on Thursday.

Last week, Schneider said the two firms would divest businesses representing sales of about 400 million euros to appease European competition regulators and that the tie-up would boost combined operating profit by 280
million euros annually from 2004.

Schneider holds 98.1 percent of Legrand stock after it launched its friendly bid in January and had been hoping to implement the merger around mid-October.
Brussels has been probing the deal for four months.
Shares in Schneider closed up 0.50 percent at 50.25 euros while Legrand ended 1.25 percent higher at 153.50. Document lba0000020010927dx9r00y40

PARIS (Dow Jones)--Schneider Electric SA (F.SCN) warned late Thursday that the European Union Commission may be preparing to veto its EUR7.9 billion merger with Legrand SA (F.LGR), its fellow French electrical components supplier.

In a short statement, Schneider said the two groups "have learned" that Brussels' special merger task force is recommending E.U. member states say no to the deal.
"For both companies, this development is completely unexpected and incomprehensible," Schneider said. "Discussions with the Merger Task Force, which led to a number of commitment from Schneider Electric and
Legrand, gave every indication that the merger would be approved," Schneider said in its statement.

"Given that all the necessary concessions have been made to provide a clear, durable solution to the statement of objections, rejection of the merger would be completely incomprehensible."

Schneider's tie-up with Legrand - a move that would create a world leader in electrical distribution and industrial automation - had already been rejected once by the European Commission because of antitrust concerns.
Commission officials are worried the newly-merged group would have too dominant a position in its local market. Last week, the French group and its partner offered to sell operating assets worth around EUR400 million a year
in revenue in a bid to secure approval from Brussels for their tie-up.

In its statement, Schneider said the Task Force's recommendation to reject the merger with Legrand was contained in a memorandum sent to a consultative committee of the E.U.'s 15 member states.
Brussels' Merger Task Force usually sends its recommendation on whether to approve a merger directly to the
European Union Commission, the E.U.'s executive branch.

However, in certain cases, the Commission can take the merger to a consultative committee made up of E.U. member states. The committee almost always supports the Commission's position

Page 9 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission, which has the final say in approving mergers, isn't expected to rule on the Schneider-Legrand tie-up until October 17.

Concessions, designed to secure Commission approval, however, have to be made at least a month before a final ruling.

The Commission would only consider concessions after the deadline if they are "clear cut", adequately address the outstanding antitrust concerns and don't require any further market testing.

Senior Schneider executives have become increasingly confident in recent weeks that Brussels would approve the Legrand merger.

In a speech to an industry conference in Paris earlier this month, Schneider chief executive Henri Lachmann set out synergies of EUR200 million the group hopes to achieve through the merger.
He insisted asset sales to win the approval of the European Commission wouldn't endanger the tie-up. Schneider's bid to merge with Legrand has already had a bumpy ride.
Back in June this year, Schneider was forced to up its offer for Legrand to head off objections by disgruntled minority shareholders who had managed to derail the company's initial bid.

Late Thursday, a source close to recent talks said Schneider and Legrand intend to continue arguing their case for the merger with the Commission, which has the final say on the tie-up.

However, the Task Force's position threatens to throw the merger into confusion. Schneider's offer to Legrand shareholders closed in August and Schneider now holds some 98% of Legrand shares.
Legally, it is unclear what the two groups could do if the Commission eventually rules against the merger. Representatives from Schneider and Legrand were holding talks with the E.U. Merger Task Force until
mid-September. At that stage, both companies were convinced the deal would go through, based on concessions
and asset sales proposed by the two French groups.
Thursday's statement is designed to keep the market abreast of developments in Brussels, the source said. A
meeting of the consultative meeting to the E.U. member states is due Friday.

EU: Antitrust Ruling On Schneider,  Legrand Oct. 10

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission will issue its final ruling on  Schneider  Electric SA's (F.SCN) proposed EUR7.9-billion acquisition of French rival  Legrand SA (F.LGR) on Oct. 10, an E.U. spokeswoman said late Thursday.
"The Commission will make its final decision on the proposed deal at its weekly meeting on Oct. 10," Amelia
Torres, told Dow Jones Newswires.
She declined to comment on a statement issued by Schneider earlier Thursday, which claimed that Commission's
Merger Task Force had recommended that the deal should be blocked.

But she did confirm that the Advisory Committee on mergers will meet Friday in Brussels to review a draft decision.

The Advisory Committee, which is made up of the national competition authorities of E.U. member states, doesn't have the authority to overrule the Commission. Its function is to give the Commission political backing in controversial merger cases.

Competition lawyers don't recall a single case in which the Committee has criticized the Commission's merger review to such an extent that the Commission has reversed its opinion.

The E.U. opened an in-depth probe into Schneider/Legrand deal amid concerns over its impact on the market for low-voltage electrical equipment, a market which is highly concentrated in France.

NEWS SNAP: Schneider  Warns EU May Block Legrand Merger
By Simon Clow and Valerie Venck
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

PARIS -(Dow Jones)-  Schneider  Electric SA (F.SCN) warned late Thursday that Brussels may be preparing to block its EUR7.9 billion merger with fellow French electrical components supplier  Legrand SA (F.LGR), a move that would leave the two groups' strategy in tatters and open up a potential legal minefield for  European companies.

In a brief statement,  Schneider  said the two groups "have learned" that the  European Union Commission's special Merger Task Force is recommending E.U. member states say no to the deal.

That could pave the way for the merger to be thrown out altogether when the Commission hands down its final ruling on the tie-up on Oct. 10.

Schneider and Legrand had been in talks with officials from the Task Force until mid-September. The groups had confidently expected Brussels to give their merger the nod after they agreed to sell off EUR400 million in assets
to secure Brussels' backing for the tie-up.
In its statement, Schneider said rejection of the merger "would be completely incomprehensible."

The French group said the Task Force's recommendation to reject the Legrand merger was contained in a memorandum sent to a consultative committee of the E.U.'s fifteen member states. Schneider did not say how it came by the memorandum. The final say on the merger lays with the European Commission, the E.U.'s executive branch.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission declined Thursday to comment on Schneider's statement. Commission officials are worried a newly-merged Schneider-Legrand would have too dominant a position,
particularly in the French and Italian markets and particularly for circuit-breakers.

If the Commission does eventually throw out the merger, it could create an unprecedented situation. Schneider's offer for Legrand - reworked last June to win crucial backing from minority shareholders - closed in August and Schneider already holds 98% of Legrand's outstanding shares.

Sources close to recent talks between the two companies and Commission officials admitted late Thursday it is unclear what Schneider and Legrand could do legally if Brussels moves next month to block the deal.

"They aren't going with that prospect for the time being, but they don't have a clue as to what they should do," said one source familiar with the situation.

Late Thursday, observers raised the prospect of Schneider being compelled to resell the shares it holds in Legrand and Legrand being snapped up by a rival like Germany's Siemens AG (G.SIE) or the U.S. group General Electric (GE).

Colette Neuville, an activist for minority shareholder rights in France, warned a rejection from Brussels would open up a legal minefield for companies and shareholders alike.

"This isn't compatible with an orderly functioning of the markets," she said. "This shows up a rather frightening level of legal insecurity in takeover bids in Europe."

The E.U. Commission has been seen as taking an increasingly muscular approach to reviews of mergers and acquisitions, as witnessed by its decision to block GE's (GE) takeover of Honeywell (HON) earlier this year.

Schneider's bid for Legrand, which would create a world leader in electrical distribution and industrial automation, has already had a bumpy ride since it was first launched in January this year.

The French group was forced to sweeten its offer for Legrand three months ago after disgruntled minority shareholders managed to derail an initial bid.

France's Schneider  Warns EU May Block Takeover of Rival Legrand

PARIS -- Schneider  Electric SA's warned late Thursday its proposed 7.9 billion euro ($7.25 billion) acquisition of French rival Legrand SA may be blocked by the  European Commission, a move that would leave the two firms' strategies in tatters and open up a potential legal minefield for  European companies.

In a brief statement, Schneider said the electrical-components suppliers "have learned" that the commission's special Merger Task Force is recommending European Union members say no to the deal. That could pave the way for the merger to be denied when the commission -- the EU's executive branch -- issues its decision on Oct.
10.

Schneider and Legrand had been in talks with officials from the task force until earlier this month. The companies had confidently expected the commission to grant approval for the acquisition after the firms agreed to sell 400 million euros in assets at the commission's request.

In its statement, Schneider said rejection of the merger "would be completely incomprehensible." The company said the task force's recommendation to reject the deal was contained in a memorandum sent to a consultative committee of the EU's 15 member states. Schneider didn't say how it obtained the memo.

A commission spokeswoman declined comment on Schneider's statement, but did say that the Advisory Committee on mergers will meet Friday in Brussels to review a draft decision. The committee, made up of the national competition authorities of EU's member states, doesn't have the authority to overrule the commission, but instead gives the commission political backing in controversial merger cases.

Commission officials are worried a combined Schneider-Legrand would have too dominant a position, particularly in the French and Italian markets and for circuit-breakers.

If the commission does kill the merger, it could create an unprecedented situation. Schneider's offer for Legrand -- reworked in June to win crucial backing from minority shareholders -- closed last month, and Schneider already holds 98% of Legrand's outstanding shares.

People close to recent talks between the two companies and commission officials admitted late Thursday it is unclear what the firms could do legally if the commission blocks the deal.

"They aren't going with that prospect for the time being, but they don't have a clue as to what they should do," said one person familiar with the situation.
Late Thursday, observers raised the prospect of Schneider being compelled to resell the shares it holds in
Legrand, and Legrand being snapped up by a rival like Germany's Siemens AG (SI) or General Electric Co. (GE).

Colette Neuville, an activist for minority-shareholder rights in France, warned a rejection from the EU would open up a legal minefield for companies and shareholders alike. "This isn't compatible with an orderly functioning of the markets," she added. "This shows up a rather frightening level of legal insecurity in takeover bids in Europe."

The commission has been seen as taking an increasingly muscular approach to reviews of mergers and acquisitions, as witnessed by its decision earlier this year to block GE's proposed takeover of Honeywell International Inc. (HON).

Schneider's bid for Legrand, which would create a world leader in electrical distribution and industrial automation, has already had a bumpy ride since it was first launched in January. Schneider was forced to sweeten its offer for Legrand three months ago after disgruntled minority shareholders managed to derail an initial bid.

European Regulators Are Poised to Reject Electronics Deal --- Market Share Is Cited In
Legrand-Schneider Deal

European antitrust enforcers are poised to reject  Schneider  Electric SA's 6.6 billion euros bid for rival  Legrand
SA, citing concerns about the combined market share of the two French electrical-equipment makers.

The European Commission's antitrust department and the two companies could still try to broker a last-minute compromise before Oct. 12 when the commission must issue its final decision. But given the last stage of the antitrust investigation, such a compromise would be unusual.

In a short statement released late Thursday, Schneider Electric expressed surprise at the commission's recommendation to reject the deal, which already has some tortured history. "For both companies this development is completely unexpected and incomprehensible," the company said.

The commission's investigators had said in March that the proposed acquisition would give rise to "significant overlaps" in a broad range of electrical products, such as systems for electricity distribution and for the control of electrical circuits. At the time, the commission decided to take an additional four months to investigate the deal.

On Sept. 14, Schneider and Legrand offered to sell about one-third of their operations in France and Italy making such products as small electricity switches and other electrical gear. The companies also made other
concessions aimed at reducing their combined market shares.

Yet the commission appears to consider these proposals insufficient. It has already sent a recommendation to block the deal to antitrust officials from the 15 member-countries of the European Union, who will discuss the commission's preliminary decision in the coming days. The so-called advisory committee has no powers to overrule the commission's antitrust decisions. People familiar with the commission's thinking say its officials think the deal will bring together two powerful rivals to forge a national champion, which will be able to dominate competition.

If Schneider and Legrand decide to offer new divestments to win approval, they will have to make sure they address all of the commission's antitrust concerns. "Not only are we ready to negotiate, up until several days ago, we were negotiating," said a person familiar with the companies' thinking. "That's why we don't understand this." The commission, for its part, says it has given the companies fair warning of what would be required to secure antitrust approval.

The two French makers of low-voltage electrical equipment unveiled their friendly merger in January and quickly gained the approval of French stock-market regulator, the Conseil des Marches Financiers.

However, the French Association for the Protection of Minority Shareholders filed a lawsuit charging that preferred shareholders were being mistreated. In early May, an appeals court in Paris sided with the association and annulled the deal, saying the council had failed to follow procedures when it approved the offer. Schneider subsequently raised its offer by 200 million euros, which was approved by the French stock-market regulator. On top of the 6.6 billion euros cash offer, Schneider had also said it will assume 1.5 billion euros of Legrand's debt.

The commission's proposed rejection of the deal "hit us like a clap of thunder," said Collette Neuville, the founder of the minority-shareholders' association. "There will be huge swings in the market (Friday)."

If the commission proceeds with its recommendation to block the acquisition, Schneider will have to disentangle itself from Legrand because part of the deal has already been completed. The commission's rejection of the deal

would come just months after its top antitrust official, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, blocked General
Electric Co.'s bid for Honeywell International Inc.

UPDATE 1-EU Commission to decide on Schneider/Legrand Oct 10.

BRUSSELS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is poised to block French electrical equipment maker Schneider  Electric's planned 6.42 billion euro ($5.9 billion) purchase of  Legrand, and said on Friday it will take final action on October 10.

The two companies, the two sector leaders on the French market, said on Thursday the Commission's Merger Task Force had issued a negative recommendation on their planned link-up, putting the creation of the world's leader in low-voltage electrical components on the brink of rejection.

An advisory committee of antitrust officials from the 15 EU member countries will discuss the negative opinion later on Friday, but the Commission has the final say.
"The Commission has no comment on the review at this stage," Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres told
Reuters.

"The deadline is October 12. As the advisory committee is only meeting today, the Commission will not be able to take a decision next week. A decision will be taken on October 10."

Last week Schneider said the two firms would divest businesses representing sales of about 400 million euros to appease European competition regulators.

EU officials said the Commission had had doubts on the feasibility of the merger right from the start given the high degree of concentration in the companies' sector and the high market shares which the two companies hold in several products.

When it announced its four-month, in-depth probe on March 30, the Commission had said the deal could damage competition in the markets for low-voltage systems used in the distribution of electricity and the control of
electrical circuits in buildings, factories and homes.

The Commission also said at the time that the planned deal was likely to give rise to significant overlaps in market shares for most of the products at issue.

Schneider holds 98.1 percent of Legrand after it launched its friendly bid in January and had been hoping to conclude the deal in mid-October.
The transaction would lead to a combination that makes 20 percent of its sales in France, 37 percent in other
European countries, 29 percent in North America and 14 percent in other parts of the world.
A blocking by the Commission would come only months after it made a controvesial decision to reject General
Electric 's proposed $42 billion purchase of Honeywell International.

UPDATE 2-Schneider,  Legrand stocks  slump as EU snubs tie-up.

(Updates shares, added investor comment, more background at end)
PARIS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Shares of French electrical equipment makers Schneider  Electric SA and  Legrand
SA slid on Friday after their long-delayed merger was dealt a heavy blow by the European Commission.
Schneider was trading down 20.1 percent at 40.15 euros at 1018 GMT, while Legrand was down 20.5 percent at
122.1 euros amid a flurry of sell orders after the companies said the Commission's Merger Task Force had issued
a negative view on the tie-up.

Schneider and Legrand, which showed their faith in a friendly 6.42 billion euro ($5.91 billion) merger with a joint half-year results news conference this month, said in a statement they were taken by surprise.

"Given that all the necessary concessions have been made to provide a clear, durable solution to the statement of objections, rejection of the merger would be completely incomprehensible," Schneider said on Thursday.
Fund managers were also taken aback.

"This is staggering," said Jacques-Antoine Bretteil, who has Schneider shares among the assets he manages at International Capital Gestion in Paris. "No one was expecting a negative decision. It seems an appalling development given the current economic climate."

The merger, which would create the world's largest maker of low-voltage electrical equipment, was unveiled in January, but Legrand minority shareholders stalled it to demand a higher offer. Now Schneider may have to sell the 98.1 percent of Legrand shares it managed to mop up.

"This merger is cursed," said one analyst who declined to be named. "After the minorities, it's Brussels's turn to pick a quarrel. If Schneider is forced to sell Legrand, that will be extremely complex to manage."

Brussels said early on that it would examine the deal minutely for evidence the new company would dominate the market for household plugs, switches and sockets, especially in France.

Later it demanded the companies sell businesses worth 400 million euros. Despite the divestitures, Schneider was still forecasting the deal would boost annual operating profit by 280 million euros from 2004.
SCHNEIDER NEEDS LEGRAND

Schneider is counting on the tie-up to prop up its earnings amid an economic slowdown. The new company would have a bigger presence in household electrical fittings and less in factory equipment, making it more insulated
from swings in business sentiment.

On June 11, Schneider said it would be difficult for it to achieve its target of an operating margin of 14 percent this year, largely due to poor market conditions in the United States.

The Commission's merger announcement prompted CIC-EIFB, CAI Cheuvreux, ABN Amro and other brokerages to cut recommendations on Schneider's shares.
The Commission said it would issue its definitive decision on October 10.


Page 26 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The Commission has no comment on the review at this stage," Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said. "A decision will be taken on October 10."

On Friday, newspaper reports suggested Schneider had frustrated the Commission by being too slow in organising the sale of assets.

Analysts said that the Commission probably came under heavy pressure from Siemens AG and possibly General Electric Co to block the merger amid concern the new group would slash prices of switches, plugs and other equipment in Europe.

"They probably piled on the pressure," said Bretteil at ICG. "If Legrand escapes Schneider's grasp, then who else could it go to?"

Blocking a merger that has in practice already taken place would represent a departure for the Commission, which earlier this year stopped General Electric Co's tie-up with Honeywell International Inc, but did it before the share offer was launched.
"The most awful thing is that the Commission is not asking for concessions," said a source close to Schneider in
Paris.

"Schneider will try to convince the European commissioners of the efforts being made to allow the merger to take place."
The source said that Schneider Chairman Henri Lachmann had not been informed in writing of the reasons for the
Commission's recommendation. (Additional reporting by Denis Thomas).

RESEARCH ALERT-ABN Amro cuts Schneider  to "hold".

PARIS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Investment bank ABN Amro said on Friday it had reduced its recommendation on
French electrical equipment firm  Schneider  to "hold" from "add" due to snags in its planned merger with peer
Legrand

"The deal seems to have little chances to survive" after  Schneider  and Legrand said late on Thursday that the European Commission's Merger Task Force had issue a negative view on their planned tie-up, ABN Amro said in its France Equity Morning Note.

The bank said a failure of the merger plans would be a "major setback for both companies...it is weakening both companies at a very difficult time given the current macro environment."
The European Commission is due to hand down its final decision on the merger on October 10.
Shares in Schneider and Legrand were down 20.08 and 22.80 percent respectively at 0907 GMT. The benchmark
CAC-40 index was up 1.19 percent at 4,060.80, while the Dow Jones STOXX industry index was up 0.6 percent.

PARIS, Sept 28 (AFP) - The price of shares in  Schneider  Electric slumped by 21.0 percent and  Legrand fell by
12.0 percent in early trading here on Friday in response to a negative view by the  EU Commission of a plan for
the two companies to merge, dealers said.

EU competition authorites had expressed a negative opinion late on Thursday.

Initially trading in the two shares was suspended on Friday because of heavy downward pressure on the prices of the stocks.

When trading began, Schneider Electric fell by 21.79 percent to 39.30 euros and Legrand by 12.05 percent to 135 euros.

ATTENTION - UPDATES prices, adds comment, clarifies source of opinion
PARIS, Sept 28 (AFP) - The price of shares in  Schneider  Electric slumped by 20.10 percent and  Legrand fell by
23.00 percent in early trading here on Friday in response to a negative view by the  EU Commission of a plan for
the two companies to merge, dealers said.

In a joint statement early on Friday the companies said: "Schneider  Electric and  Legrand have learned that the European Commission's merger task force (MTF) has sent a memorandum to the consultative committee of the member states containing a negative recommendation on the Schnieder Electric-Legrand merger.
"For both companies this development is completely unexpected and incomprehensible."

Schneider Electric is a leading electrical automation business and Legrand makes mid-voltage electrical equipment.

Initially trading in the two shares was suspended on Friday because of heavy downward pressure on the prices of the stocks.

Shortly after trading had begun, the price of shares in Schneider was showing a loss of 10.10 euros or 20.1 percent to 40.15 euros and Legrand stock had slumped by 35.50 euros or 23 percent to 118.00 euros.

One Paris dealer said: "Frankly, I'm surprised Schneider has fallen by so little. There's definitely more down side and it could lose up to 35 percent."
He said, however, that many investors were waiting to see what the EU did next.

"It's not totally bleak for Schneider. It all depends what concessions the EU comes up with and whether the merger can support them. If Schneider's forced to divest too much, the deal's expected synergies will be lost and the merger will start to look very expensive," the dealer said.
If the price of shares in Schneider fell much further, bargain hundters might begin to buy, he commented. "In pure valuation terms, if you extract the impact from Legrand, Schneider is starting to look quite cheap.
Investors were already beginning to buy the shares because of their recovery prospects and we could see that
happening again."

PARIS -(Dow Jones)-  Schneider  Electric (F.SCN) Chairman Henri Lachmann, his counterpart Francois Grappotte at  Legrand (F.LGR), analysts who follow the companies, and France's regulatory authorities all need to stock up on handkerchiefs.

They'll all have a good deal of egg on their faces if Brussels says "no," as looks likely, to the EUR7.9-billion merger of the two French companies.

Schneider and Legrand, like General Electric (GE) and Honeywell (HON) among others before them, seem to have made a big miscalculation over Brussels' determination to protect consumers and foster competition in the E.U.

As the steep sell-off Friday in both companies' shares - Schneider owns 98% of Legrand - shows, many investors have been caught on the hop too.

That doesn't say much for the advice they've received from analysts. This has largely assumed the merger would go through with only minor disposals, like the companies' low-voltage appliance activities in France.

France's stock market regulator has also acknowledged it may change its rules so that a takeover deal can be revoked if Brussels rejects it on anti-trust grounds, even if it has met French regulatory and legal requirements.

Minority shareholders - particularly those of Legrand's preference shares - will be irked too. They successfully pressured Schneider to sweeten its first offer for Legrand.
However, Schneider and Legrand have more than flying eggs to look out for.
Schneider's Lachmann has been publicly dismissive of any anti-trust threat to the merger.

He has based Schneider's growth strategy on acquiring Legrand, and must now go back to the drawing-board, with his reputation damaged, if not in tatters.

Shareholders will obviously scrutinize any major restructuring of the combined group management offers if it tries to salvage the merger. They will also be nervous of any dismantling of Schneider-Legrand that Brussels insists on if the merger can't be rescued.

It's not looking pretty. Schneider-Legrand shareholders face a dilution of their investment one way or another, and a forced sale - partial or otherwise - of Legrand assets means Schneider won't get much of price for them.

With a fifth of Schneider-Legrand's combined market value, or EUR3.1 billion, wiped off Friday, a smaller, restructured Schneider may find itself at risk to a takeover bid itself from rivals such as Siemens (G.SIE), ABB (Z.ABB) or braver smaller players keen to take advantage of the French company's misjudgment.
Even so, shareholders may be praying for just that right now; at least it holds out the hope of a bid premium.

EU: Schneider,  Legrand Know Where They Stand On Deal

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission Friday said  Schneider  Electric SA (F.SCN) and French rival Legrand SA (F.LGR) were kept informed during the E.U.'s antitrust review of their proposed EUR7.9-billion linkup, which the companies say the E.U. is poised to block.

"The Merger Task Force has been very clear. The companies know where they stand," E.U. spokesman Michael Tsherny said, responding to criticisms from the companies over the way E.U. regulators have been handling the case.

A person familiar with the Commission's thinking said its officials believe the deal will forge a powerful national champion that will squeeze out players in a market that is already highly concentrated.

The E.U. opened an in-depth probe into the deal in March amid concerns over its impact on the market for low-voltage electrical equipment. This covers all systems used for electricity distribution and the control of electrical circuits in buildings, factories and homes.

Thursday, Schneider said the Commission has sent a recommendation to block the deal to antitrust officials from the Advisory Committee of the E.U.'s 15 member states. The company expressed surprised at the nature of the recommendation.
"Discussions with the Merger Task Force, which led to a number of commitments from Schneider Electric and
Legrand, gave every indication that the merger would be approved," Schneider said.

"Given that all the necessary concessions have been made to provide a clear, durable solution to the statement of objections, rejection of the merger would be completely incomprehensible," it added.

Tscherny confirmed that the deadline for the companies to offer concessions had expired Sept. 14, but declined to comment on reports that Schneider and Legrand had offered to sell part of their operations in France and Italy to alleviate the E.U.'s antitrust concerns.

Yet the Commission appears to consider the concessions offered thus far as insufficient. The Commission confirmed that the Advisory Committee is reviewing the draft decision Friday, but the Commission declined to confirm the nature of the decision.

The Committee doesn't have the authority to overrule the Commission. Competition lawyers don't recall a single case in which the Committee has criticized the Commission's merger review to such an extent that the Commission has reversed its opinion.
Legal sources said Friday that the deal will be blocked unless the companies come up with further remedies. "It is clear that the companies have to put more on the table to save the deal," one said. "In such cases, it is a
commercial question. The companies have to decide whether it is financially feasible to offer any more or if in
doing so they would undermine the rational of the deal," he said.
Under E.U. antitrust rules, companies can offer further concessions until the last minute providing that they are
"clear cut" and don't require further market testing.
The Commission will decide on the deal at its weekly meeting Oct. 10.

Schneider  Could Face Legrand Fire Sale If Merger Blocked
By Greg Keller

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- French electrical equipment maker Schneider  Electric SA (F.SCN) will most likely be forced to have a fire sale of its recently acquired rival, Legrand SA (F.LGR), if, as expected, the  European Commission blocks the deal on competition grounds, analysts said.

Moreover, the managers who will be flogging the goods have seen their reputation shattered and their company has itself become the object of takeover speculation.

Schneider acquired Legrand in a EUR7.9 billion cash-and-shares offer that, crucially, was made binding independent of European Union approval. With French regulators saying the deal is done and the E.U. saying it can't go forward, analysts say Schneider-Legrand management finds itself at an impasse from which it may get out alive, only to find it has instantly become prey for foreign rivals.
"There's no solution - they'll sell Legrand," said Athmane Benzerroug, an analyst at Aurel Leven.

"The selling price should be far lower than the purchase price paid by Schneider last August," said Societe Generale analyst Fabrice Theveneau, adding that Germany's Siemens AG (SI) could be among the potential buyers.

Schneider shares dropped as much as 23% Friday following the company's statement late Thursday that the E.U.'s Merger Task Force had made a negative recommendation to the commission's Advisory Committee. Around 1435 GMT, Schneider shares were down 17% to EUR41.70, and Legrand was down 17% to EUR127.50.

The Committee met Friday. The E.U. Commission is scheduled to rule on the merger Oct. 10. Competition lawyers said they couldn't recall a single case in which the Advisory Committee has criticized the Commission's merger review to such an extent that the Commission has reversed its opinion.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate Schneider shares could fall up to 30% if it is forced to sell Legrand. "We see this as the worst outcome, since we believe it would heavily compromise the realizable value of
Schneider's stake in Legrand," the analysts said in a note.

As for Schneider boss Henri Lachmann, who had staked his company's future growth on this merger, "his reputation is shattered," Benzerroug said. "He was so confident three weeks ago. We're all surprised," he added.

Schneider told French daily newspaper Le Monde Friday it is "ready to negotiate" with the Commission, but analysts said they doubt anything will save the merger now.

"It will probably have to sell Legrand to another company like Siemens for an enterprise value estimated at EUR4.5 billion... against a purchase price of EUR7.2 billion in August, representing a net loss of EUR11.4 a share," Theveneau said.

Schneider and Legrand had already offered to sell about one-third of their operations in France and Italy, making such products as small electricity switches and other electrical gear, to reduce their combined market shares. The companies had agreed to sell EUR400 million in assets at the Commission's request, but it was apparently not enough to convince the E.U.

For Schneider investors, the only good news in all this is the possibility that Schneider could itself become a takeover target.

"There were rumors saying that Legrand and Schneider were both potential targets and that other parties were interested," said one New York-based arbitrageur. "Schneider could be a buy below EUR40. The stock is liquid, it got smacked recently, people were thinking that it paid too much for Legrand, so the cancellation of the operation could be good and it is still a potential target," he said.

A leading maker of electrical fittings,  Schneider  Electric S.A., said that European antitrust regulators were recommending that the  European Commission reject its $6 billion purchase of Legrand S.A. The company had relied on the purchase, which was completed in July, to offer products like phone jacks and motion sensors to compete with ABB Ltd. and General Electric. Now,  Schneider  may have to sell Legrand, or parts of it, at a loss as economic growth slows and stocks slide, analysts said.

(EU) EU/COMPETITION - Serious doubt hangs over Schneider/Legrand merger.

Brussels, 28/09/2001 (Agence  Europe) - The technical services of the  European Commission's DG for Competition has presented the Member States' Advisory Committee with a negative opinion on the merger between Schneider  Electric and  Legrand. It is now up to the Commission to make the final decision on 10
October, but this opinion suggests it may decide to reject the merger. Amelia Torres, Commissioner Monti's spokesperson, simply said that the Commission had no comments to make at this stage, but the two companies seem to have made insufficient commitments too late. The partners are proposing to dispose of activities with a turnover of EUR 400 million. The  European Commission has had reservations about the merger for months, fearing the emergence of a company that would dominate the low-tension electrical equipment market.

It refused to give the go-ahead to the first phase in order to examine in greater detail the impact of the merger and to give the companies time to make commitments (see EUROPE of 4 April, p.14).

COMMISSION LIKELY TO BLOCK SCHNEIDER-LEGRAND DEAL.

European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2001 European Report.
Schneider  Electric's Euro 8.0 billion merger with French electrical equipment manufacturer  Legrand is set to be blocked by the European Commission it was revealed late on September 27. The announcement suggests that the companies are unwilling to continue their talks with the Commission. It is very likely that the Commission will rule against the merger and this will be the decision the Commissioners make on advice from the Competition Commissioner Mario Monti at their weekly meeting on October 10.

"Deadlines are very strict in all merger cases," said a Competition spokesman. "We can talk to the companies until the very last moment." The spokesman added that the second phase of the investigation, which was originally opened on March 30, was extended because the Commission had asked for more information on the deal and because of changes Schneider and Legrand made to the merger agreement. The merger would create the world's largest electrical systems group, with a Euro 12.4 billion turnover and a workforce of 94,000. The
companies had already during their negotiations with the Commission to dispose of assets worth Euro 400 million in France and Italy.Shares in both companies fell by around 20% on September 28 as the market reacted badly following the news of the very likely failure of the merger. "The drop in shares is inherent in a share offer that they made. I cannot imagine that the companies, which are in a strong position in the market did not take this
possibility into account when they structured the deal," said the Commission spokesman.

Companies: Schneider  Makes Last-Minute Effort To Get Approval for Legrand Deal --- Company Hopes to
Salvage Merger in New Talks With EU Regulators

PARIS -- Schneider  Electric SA is mounting a last-ditch lobbying campaign in Brussels this week to gain
European Commission approval for its 6.6 billion euro acquisition of French rival  Legrand SA.

But if  European antitrust watchdogs follow through with plans to block the deal, legal experts say  Schneider would be forced to sell the 98% it owns in  Legrand. Moreover, Schneider  executives and directors are likely to face tough questions from angry shareholders about how the deal could fall apart two months after most  Legrand stockholders tendered their shares.

The prospect of a messy denouement sent investors running for the exits Friday, after Schneider revealed the commission's preliminary decision to block the deal. Schneider shares plunged 20% or 10.25 euros, to 40 euros. Thinly traded Legrand shares skidded 13%, or 20.50 euros, to 133 euros.

Schneider officials scrambled over the weekend to set up appointments with commissioners, who are slated to make a final ruling Oct. 10 on whether the two French makers of low-voltage electrical equipment can merge. People close to the company say it is prepared to make further concessions, but that regulators have said it is too late. Merger lawyers and industry analysts also say Schneider is unlikely to salvage the deal this late in the review process.

"Schneider is in a huge dilemma," says Sophie L'Helias, a lawyer who represented holders of Legrand preferred shares in a successful attempt to force Schneider to sweeten its offer. "They're going to have to figure out a way to sell the company."

If antitrust regulators force Schneider to unload Legrand, the task will be complicated by the stock-market slump in the wake of last month's terrorist attacks in the U.S. Given the current climate, Legrand is likely to fetch much less than it did in August, when Schneider completed its tender offer, say analysts. Societe Generale analyst Fabrice Theveneau figures Legrand would fetch just 4.5 billion euros today. In addition to the 6.6 billion euro price tag, Schneider also agreed to take on Legrand debt, raising the deal's total cost to 7.9 billion euros.

Schneider officials are being criticized for their handling of the friendly merger. The deal was unveiled in January, but stumbled over a legal challenge from preferred shareholders before it ran into objections from competition regulators in Brussels. They argue the combined company would be too powerful in France and Italy. The lightening rod for most of the criticism is Henri Lachmann, Scheider's chairman, who staked the company's future on the merger with Legrand.

"His reputation is shattered," says Athmane Benzerroug, an analyst with Aurel Leven. "He was so confident three weeks ago. We're all surprised."

Schneider in early September offered to sell 400 million euros in assets to decrease its clout in France and Italy. The company said it was shocked to learn that antitrust officials recommended nixing the merger. A spokesman for the competition office in Brussels, however, said the company has known for some time that it hadn't gone far enough in reducing its clout in those markets.

ROME, Oct 2 (Reuters) -  EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said on Tuesday he would propose blocking the planned merger between French electrical equipment maker  Schneider  Electric and its peer  Legrand .

The European Commission is due to take a final decision on the 6.42 billion euro tie up on October 10. "The proposal that I have prepared for the Commission is to not authorise this operation," Monti told reporters.

Schneider  says still in talks with EU - source.

(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - A source close to Schneider  Electric SA said on Wednesday that the French electrical equipment maker was still in last-minute talks with European regulators to try to salvage its merger with peer Legrand SA.

Shares of  Schneider,  which makes household plugs and switches and factory control equipment, fell 2.7 percent to 39.99 euros at 0935 GMT after  European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told reporters yesterday that his recommendation would be that the tie-up be blocked.

The stock has slumped since September 27, when the company said the Commission's merger task force had issued a negative opinion.

Schneider-Legrand would be the world's largest maker of low-voltage electrical equipment. The fusion, announced in January, has been probed in detail by European regulators, who demanded the companies sell businesses worth 400 million euros.
Analysts said the Commission probably came under intense pressure from rivals Siemens AG and General
Electric Co, who feared prices would be forced lower by such a large competitor.

The source said the regulators may still demand further concessions rather than crush the merger outright. Schneider now owns 98.1 percent of Legrand and needs a positive decision to avoid having to resell at a heavy discount.

Schneider paid 7.2 billion euros for Legrand, excluding debt. SG Securities analyst Fabrice Theveneau reckons it could be resold for 4.5 billion euros, leading to a 20 percent dilution in Schneider's net profit.

"Commission recommendations have been overruled in the past," said the source. "Once the recommendation is submitted, Brussels may be ask to renegotiate the quantity of divestitures necessary."

"If the recommendation is definitively negative, the conditions for the sale of Legrand will need to be looked at, in particular the deadline," the source said.

Last week's recommendation by the Commission task force was passed with four votes against the tie-up and three in favour, with two abstentions, the source added.

UPDATE 2-Schneider/Legrand deal dead-Commission sources.
By David Lawsky and Tom Pfeiffer

BRUSSELS/PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Schneider  Electric SA has no chance of winning regulatory approval for its merger with French peer  Legrand SA when the European Commission decides next week, two Commission sources said on Wednesday.

Earlier, a source in Paris close to company management expressed hope there might be a way of salvaging the deal between the electrical equipment makers through last-minute talks, but Commission sources dismissed such talk as unjustified speculation.

"Nothing is going to happen any more," said one of the sources. "It would be a miracle if something were to happen and we don't believe in miracles."

Schneider owns 98.1 percent of Legrand but lacks power to vote its stock. It desperately needs approval to avoid having to resell at a heavy discount, but a Commission source said the problem was that the firm structured the deal carelessly.

Shares of Schneider, which makes household plugs and switches and factory control equipment, closed at 40 euros, down 2.7 percent on the day. Schneider was trading at its lowest levels since January 1997.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told reporters in Rome on Tuesday that he would recommend the Commission block the deal when it meets on October 10.

Analysts said the Commission probably came under intense pressure from rivals Siemens AG and General Electric Co, who feared prices would be forced lower by such a large competitor. A Commission source said that it has been under high-level pressure from Paris to change its views, but will not succumb.
The Paris source said the Commission demanded the companies sell businesses worth 400 million euros. But the
Commission looked not at their value but at their composition.
MAJOR PROBLEMS

The Commission source said the divestitures offered by Schneider presented major problems because they would struggle to compete against what would become the world's largest maker of low-voltage electrical equipment.
The transaction was badly designed, a second Commission source said.

In a private deal, Schneider bought a large chunk of the company from two private shareholders but failed to make it contingent on Commission approval. Said the Commission source: "That was careless."

Once the private deal was concluded Schneider had passed a threshold set by French securities law, the firm was required to make an offer on all of the remaining stock, the Commission source said. French law prohibited Schneider from conditioning the purchase of that remaining stock on Commission approval, the source said.

As a result, Schneider wound up owning nearly all of the stock but under Commission rules cannot vote it because the deal has not been approved.

If the deal is rejected, Schneider can set a deadline in co-operation with the Commission to divest the Legrand stock or face having it sold by a trustee.

Schneider paid 7.2 billion euros for Legrand, excluding debt. SG Securities analyst Fabrice Theveneau estimated it could be resold for 4.5 billion euros, leading to a 20 percent dilution in Schneider's net profit.

A Commission source said that last week's recommendation by the Commission task force was passed on a 6-3 vote by the EU's executive advisory committee.
Six of the 15 members - there is one for each of the EU states - were missing. The source dismissed reports from
Paris of a closer vote.

Fabius appeals to Monti on Schneider-Legrand merger.

PARIS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius has appealed to European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti not to block  Schneider  Electric SA's acquisition of peer Legrand SA , a ministry spokeswoman said on Thursday.
"That is correct," the spokeswoman said, confirming a report published in French newspaper Le Monde on
Thursday that Fabius had telephoned Monti to make the request.
Le Monde also said in the unsourced report that French President Jacques Chirac had thrown his weight behind
Schneider by telephoning European Commission President Romano Prodi to intervene.
The Commission is due to decide on the merger next week and two Commission sources told Reuters on
Wednesday that Schneider had no chance of winning regulatory approval for the merger.

According to the paper, Chirac complained of the heavy consequences that the failure of the merger would have on French employment levels. Presidential officials declined to comment on the report.

Schneider's acquisition of Legrand would make it the world's biggest manufacturer of household electrical equipment.

The company announced the acquisition in January, but was forced to delay the plan when Legrand minority shareholders appealed for a higher offer price and the Commission, fearing the new company would be too powerful in European markets, opened an in-depth review.

A veto of the merger would force Schneider to sell the 98.1 percent of Legrand it acquired for far less than the price it paid originally, weighing heavily on its profits.

Schneider paid 7.2 billion euros for Legrand, excluding debt. SG Securities analyst Fabrice Theveneau estimated it could be resold for 4.5 billion euros, leading to a 20 percent dilution in Schneider's net profit.
Weakened by the failed merger, both companies could now fall prey to foreign rivals such as Siemens AG of
Germany or U.S. giant General Electric Co .
Analysts said both companies probably lobbied hard in Brussels to block the French merger. Document lba0000020011004dxa400xo2

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- France may lobby in favor of the merger of Schneider  Electric (F.SCN) and  Legrand (F.LGR) in a last-ditch effort to save the deal from being blocked by European Union competition authorities, Les Echos reports.
The government may argue the deal aims to create "a  European champion big enough to take on U.S. and
Japanese competitors," the paper says, citing government sources.

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- French President Jacques Chirac and Finance Minister Laurent Fabius have telephoned European Commission President Romano Prodi and competition commissioner Mario Monti urging them to approve the merger of  Schneider  Electric SA (F.SCN) and  Legrand SA (F.LGR), the French daily newspaper Le Monde reported Thursday.

Chirac told Prodi that if the Commission blocks the merger, as it appears it will do, there will be social consequences in France and industrial consequences in  Europe, Le Monde said.
France's president is concerned about a possible foreign takeover of Legrand, possibly by Siemens (SI) or
General Electric (GE) if the merger with Schneider falls apart, Le Monde added.

The E.U. is due to rule on the merger Oct. 10. On Tuesday, Monti said he would recommend the merger be blocked. The commission's merger task force found that the combined group would have a too dominant market position in France and Italy.

French leaders urge EU to back Schneider/Legrand merger: reports

(Copyright 2001)
PARIS, Oct 5 (AFP) - The French president and finance minister have lobbied  EU officials for approval for a merger totalling 8.0 billion euros (7.36 billion dollars) merger between electric equipment groups  Schneider Electric and  Legrand, press reports said Friday.

President Jacques Chirac and Finance Minister Laurent Fabius personally intervened to argue for  European Commission approval of the deal, after competition commissioner Mario Monti said Tuesday he would recommend it be rejected on the grounds of unacceptable dominance in some  European countries.

The two companies merged in late July, with Schneider Electric now holding 98.1 percent of Legrand as the result of a public takeover offer.

But the combined group, currently a world leader in low-tension electric equipment and automatic industrial systems, could become takeover prey if the commission forces it to undo the deal, said reports in the French daily Le Monde and the Financial Times.

Siemens and General Electric are mentioned as possible predators if the commission follows Monti's recommendation when it examines the merger next Wednesday.

Le Monde said in its edition dated on Friday that French members of the commission felt Monti's office had not given the two groups a full list of possible objections when they were hammering out details of their merger.

The Financial Times quoted Friday an official in Brussels who said that Schneider and Legrand were trying to create a global company that would have too much weight in individual European Union states.
"They were trying to create a strong competitor worldwide," the official was quoted as saying.
"The problem was that the strong competitor would have large market shares in some European countries."

Last month, the FT said, the same principle had led the commission to reject a 12-billion-euro merger of Swedish banks SEB and ForeningsSparbanken, and last year the planned merger of truck- making units of Swedish groups Volvo and Scania.

Brussels, 04/10/2001 (Agence  Europe) - Commissioner Mario Monti said on Tuesday in Rome that he was planning to suggest that the Commission should not accept the merger between the French groups  Schneider and Legrand, a merger which last Friday's advisory committee had already spoken against. A vote which, we recall, was won by just one vote. The Commission should give its verdict on 10 October (see  EUROPE of 29
September, p.14). Mr Monti declared, moreover, that he did not have any objection to the non-aggression pact envisaged by the insurance groups Axa, Generali and Allianz, whereby the three partners undertake not to carry out a "raid" on territories where one of the two at least is present, a pact currently being scrutinised by the Commission's relevant services. "The responses provided are still being examined, but at this stage it does not seem that this poses problems from the point of view of competition rules", said the Commissioner.

Helsinki, 05/10/2001 (Agence  Europe) - Commissioner Mario Monti said in Helsinki on Friday that he would be asking his colleagues to issue a negative opinion on 10 October on the Schneider/Legrand merger. This would have serious repercussions on Schneider,  which acquired 98% of the Legrand in August through an exchange offer. It would be disastrous for Schneider  to resell its stake since it would make it easy prey to a potential hostile takeover bid, and it would also spell disaster for  Legrand which would be left without support. This point was made to Romano Prodi and Mario Monti this week in phone calls from the French President, Jacques Chirac, and the French Finance Minister, Laurent Fabius.

BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is set to block  Schneider  Electric SA's merger with French peer Legrand SA on Wednesday without discussion despite the French government's attempts to change the Commission's mind, a Commission source said on Tuesday.

Top Commisssion officials decided at a meeting late on Monday that the proposal to block the deal between the two electrical equipment makers would be on the agenda for the Commission's Wednesday meeting as a point to be approved without discussion, the source said.

That appears to put paid to French government hopes of persuading the European Union's executive body to permit the all-French deal.

UPDATE 1-Schneider-Legrand deal seen rejected Wednesday.

(Re-leads, new throughout)

BRUSSELS, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is expected to ignore pressure from French business and government leaders and reject a plan on Wednesday by  Schneider  Electric to buy rival  Legrand .

Schneider announced the 6.42 billion euro ($5.86 billion) takeover of Legrand in January, a deal which would create the world's biggest manufacturer of household and other low-voltage electrical equipment. But Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said earlier this month he would recommend against the deal because it would damage competition, assuring its blockage.

At a meeting late on Monday, top Commission officials decided a proposal to block the deal between the two electrical equipment makers would be on the agenda for the Commission's Wednesday meeting as a point to be approved without discussion, a Commission source said.
That assures quick approval of Monti's recommendation. NOT CONVINCED
Along the way, French President Jacques Chirac learned what U.S. President George Bush learned earlier this year - direct political pressure from the top is not necessarily an effective way to convince Monti.

Chirac weighed in by telephoning European Commission President Romano Prodi, asking him to intervene and warning that a failed merger would swell unemployment. French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius appealed directly to Monti. Bush had used different reasoning but he and members of his cabinet told Monti and the European Commission that they should permit General Electric, which makes jet engines, to acquire Honeywell International, which makes avionics. In both cases, Monti did not budge.

Instead, he has repeated publicly - most recently in a speech in Helsinki on Friday - that what matters to him is an economic analysis that reveals the effects of a deal on customers.

"We look first, and above all, at demand substitutability, that is to perfect or near perfect substitutes readily available in the geographic area or in an alternative area, to which consumers or users can actually switch should the price increase," Monti said in explaining the approach of his agency.

And by that measure the Schneider-Legrande deal - although favored by the top politicians in France - was a bad deal for French consumers, Monti reasoned, because they would have no alternative if the new firm raised prices.

The company said it had offered 400 million euros ($365 million) of divestitures to solve problems, Le Monde reported last week. In a similar way, GE executives said they had offered more than $2 billion of divestitures.
But in both cases, the size of the divestitures was not the issue for the Commission.

Instead, the issue was whether the divestitures would change the structure of the market and preserve competition.

In the case of Schneider, the Commission feared that the divested entities would not be able to survive on their own against what would become the world's largest maker of low-voltage electric equipment.

Page 59 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
For Schneider, the issue is that they have already purchased 98.1 percent of the stock of Legrand. They have not been able to vote the stock while the deal was being reviewed and, given the decision expected Wednesday, they are expected to have to sell it at a considerable loss.

ANALYSIS-Schneider, Legrand out in cold as merger blocked.
By Tom Pfeiffer
726 words
9 October 2001
18:00
Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
PARIS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - A probable  European Union veto on Schneider  Electric's acquisition of  Legrand SA will leave the two French electrical equipment makers directionless and vulnerable to predators, analysts said on Tuesday.

Though a formal decision is not expected until Wednesday, sources at the  EU's Brussels headquarters have already said the deal is dead in the water because the new company would be able to dictate prices to consumers.

Schneider paid 7.2 billion euros ($6.6 billion) for its peer, including debt, to create the world's biggest maker of household plugs, switches and junction boxes. Analysts have estimated Legrand may now fetch as little as 4.5 billion euros.

That would put a hole in its balance sheet and alienate investors, who would be more prepared to sell control to rivals such as Tyco, Honeywell (HON.N or Emerson.

"Schneider will be smaller, with less financial firepower and more exposed to a predator," said a London-based analyst who requested anonymity.

General Electric Co and Siemens AG said earlier this year they were not planning to expand in low-voltage equipment, but that was when Legrand and Schneider were worth far more.
Schneider's market value has fallen 18 percent since September 27, when news first broke that the European
Commission's Merger Task Force would recommend the deal be scrapped.

A Commission veto would come as a shock for Schneider as well as for financial analysts and the French government, which was keen to create a strong national champion to rival General Electric, and was convinced it could win Brussels over.
Schneider was hoping the combination would bring it an extra 280 million euros in operating profit annually from
2003.

The acquisition was also designed to lower the proportion of Schneider's business in recession-sensitive factory automation equipment and expand its presence in the more sheltered field of household plugs and switches.

On Tuesday Schneider shares fell 1.6 percent to 41.13 euros, and analysts said the EU veto and the resulting loss of synergies were reflected in the share price.

Schneider stock has fallen 47 percent since the beginning of the year as it warned it may not reach its goal for an operating margin of 14 percent in 2001.

"The European Union rejection is already priced in with Schneider," said a Paris-based analyst, who said she saw fair value for the shares at 50 euros and recommended investors "buy" the stock if the Commission overrules the takeover on Wednesday.
MERGER IS A SWITCH-OFF

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti has said the decision to overrule the merger was based on whether consumers had the real ability to choose the products of a competitor.

Page 61 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
One of the biggest sticking points was the new company's overwhelming presence in the French and Italian markets for circuit breakers, devices required by law in homes and factories that cut off power when the current surges.

Analysts suspect the decision was also partly intended to show that Monti, who earlier this year overruled GE's acquisition of Honeywell, could get tough on European companies.

The options for Schneider are: to sell Legrand to a competitor, to relist Legrand shares in the market or to spin Legrand off by distributing new shares in both companies to Schneider shareholders. Schneider has 98 percent of Legrand.

"This answer (a spin-off) is an attractive one as they would end up paying far less tax," said the Paris-based analyst.

Sources close to Schneider say the company may well appeal against the Commission's ruling or at least try to win more time either to prepare a new offer with more divestitures or to engineer an organised sell-off of Legrand.
During a four-month EU review, Schneider had offered to sell 400 million euros of activities, about a third of
Legrand's business, which already made the justification for the tie-up look flimsy.

"You can never say there is zero chance that this merger will be salvaged," said the Paris analyst. "But they needed the maximum synergies to make it worthwhile, and the more businesses they are forced to sell, the less sense it all makes."

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- That  Schneider  Electric SA's (F.SCN) acquisition of  Legrand SA (F.LGR) will be rejected by the European Commission Wednesday is taken as a given by nearly all analysts and industry watchers.

"In terms of  Schneider-Legrand, it's looking pretty black for them," one Brussels-based competition lawyer familiar with the case said Tuesday.

Under European Union Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, "the commissioners would be extremely unlikely to reverse the competition directorate's decision."

The lawyer was referring to news Sept. 27 that, against the expectations of Schneider-Legrand's management and most analysts, the commission's preliminary decision would be to block the deal on the grounds of the overly dominant market position Schneider-Legrand would have in some markets, such as France and Italy. Monti has since then confirmed that view.

Neither analysts in Paris nor E.U. watchers in Brussels now see any hope for the merger, which was first announced in January and aimed at creating a world leader in the low-voltage electrical equipment market.

If the European Commission rules to block the merger, Schneider will be stuck not only looking for a new strategy, but also looking for a buyer for Legrand.

Unlike French steel group Usinor (F.USN), which has decided to wait for Brussels' green light before going ahead with its offer to acquire Spain's Aceralia SA (E.ACS) and Luxembourg's Arbed SA (L.ARB), Schneider has
already bought Legrand, for EUR7.2 billion in August. So it can't simply unwind its original merger plan.

In current gloomy market conditions, a sale isn't going to be fun. Societe Generale analyst Fabrice Theveneau estimates Schneider won't get more than EUR4.5 billion for the business, for a net loss of EUR11.4 a share.

Sharks are beginning to circle already, with groups able to finance the acquisition with debt seen as the best placed to take a bite: General Electric Co. (GE), Siemens AG (SI) or Tyco International Ltd. (TYC) have all been mentioned as possibilities.

The impact on Schneider shares Wednesday if the merger is blocked should be small, as the stock has already fallen 18% since news of the impending decision broke.
The stock was down 98 cents, or 2.4%, at EUR40.81 at Tuesday's close in Paris.
Schneider might appeal against any Brussels ruling that went against the merger, but analysts don't fancy the
French company's chances.

"As far as I know there's never been an overturning of a negative merger ruling on a substantive point of law," the Brussels-based competition lawyer said. "Besides which, these appeals take years, so once the Commission has made the negative decision the deal is effectively dead."

Paris shares up midday as bargains  lure outweigh...

Oct 10, 2001 (FWN Select via COMTEX) - Share prices were higher midday in volatile trading conditions as investor appetite for attractively priced issues particularly in the media and advertising sectors outweighed uncertainty linked to the current geo-political situation, dealers said.  Schneider  Electric meanwhile fell following the EU's decision to block its merger with  Legrand. At 12.26 pm, the CAC-40 index was up 29.64 at 4,206.61
Volume was 1.07 bln euro. On the Matif, October CAC-40 futures were trading up 29.0 at 4,216.0 while
December 10-year French government bond futures were 0.07 firmer at 89.95. The euro was last trading at
0.9118/22 usd compared with 0.9162/67 in late trade yesterday The CAC-40 index moved resolutely into positive
territory as investor appetite for a bargain gained the upper hand, albeit temporarily, over uncertainty linked to the
current political crisis, dealers said.

"Investors are attracted by the low valuations but at the same time there are geo-political factors which they are unable to control," said a dealer. "Taking out those geo-political factors, this is a market everyone would be buying into." TMT issues, which started the morning in negative territory on the back of a weak Nasdaq close yesterday, rebounded late morning led by media stocks. TF1 built on gains seen yesterday, climbing 0.76 eur or
3.04 pct at 25.79. M6 was 0.37 higher at 20.10 while NRJ Groupe was up 0.63 at 13.88. Dealers said the sector remained one of the most undervalued on the market which explained the investor rush to buy. Telecom stocks also held up, extending gains seen yesterday with France Telecom up 0.40 at 36.30 and Orange 0.08 higher at
8.40 Outside the TMT sector, Schneider Electric fell sharply before recovering slightly after the EU rejected its merger with Legrand. "It's very bad news indeed," said a Paris-based dealer. "There had been some hope the decision may be deferred pending further deliberations." "Now we're going to have a demerger. That's a costly business. I hope the EU will give them 18 months to carry it out. They can give them anything between six to 18 months to demerge. Schneider Electric was last down 0.32 at 40.49 off an earlier low of 40.00 while Legrand was up 3.10 at 133.30. In the pharmaceutical sector, Rhodia soared 0.89 or 14.15 pct at 7.18 as rumours circulated that German giant BASF AG may be mulling a bid for its French rival, dealers said. Among second tier stocks, Nexans fell sharply after the company warned that profits on ordinary operations and net profit will fall in 2001 compared with last year, because of a recent deterioration of its international business environment, dealers said. Nexans was last down 0.40 at 14.80. Shares in Eurotunnel SA were sharply down late morning after Eurostar Groupe, which operates passenger train services through the Channel Tunnel, reported a drop in passenger
traffic in the third quarter, saying the outlook remains uncertain following the US terrorist attacks, dealers said. "The stock is certainly sensitive to recent events," said a dealer, "although using the tunnel probably remains a safer way to travel than by plane." Eurotunnel was last down 0.02 or 5.33 pct at 0.71 Faurecia was down 2.95 or
5.49 pct at 50.80 after the car parts manufacturer said it was forecasting a drop-off in activity as a number of car manufacturers cut back their production. mc/lam

Oct 10, 2001 (FWN Select via COMTEX) - Share prices were higher midafternoon in across the board gains, with TMT issues such as Alcatel, Lagardere and Cap Gemini leading the risers in a market which continues to show resilience in light of the uncertain geopolitical situation, dealers said.  Schneider  Electric however languished in negative territory after the  EU commission refused to approve the group's merger with  Legrand. At 3.20 pm, the CAC-40 index was up 36.74 at 4,213.71 Volume was 1.91 bln euro. On the Matif, October CAC-40 futures were trading up 33.0 at 4,220.0 while December 10-year French government bond futures were down 0.02 at 89.86
The euro was last trading at 0.9147/51 usd compared with 0.9162/67 in late trade yesterday. The benchmark index remained firmly rooted in positive territory in afternoon trade supported by a raft of gains across a range of sectors ahead of the US markets open, dealers said.

TF1 built on gains seen yesterday, climbing 0.85 eur or 3.40 pct at 25.88. M6 was 0.72 higher at 20.45 while NRJ Group was up 0.82 at 14.07 Dealers said the sector remained one of the most undervalued on the market which explained the investor rush to buy. Telecom stocks also held up, extending gains seen yesterday with France Telecom up 0.40 at 36.30 and Orange 0.12 higher at 8.44 Other TMT blue chips to show strong gains include Alcatel up 0.72 at 13.21, Cap Gemini 2.75 higher at 59.60 and Lagardere which soared 2.76 at 37.60 Outside the TMT sector, Schneider Electric fell sharply before recovering slightly after the EU rejected its merger with Legrand. "It's very bad news indeed," said a Paris-based dealer. "There had been some hope the decision may
be deferred pending further deliberations." "Now we're going to have a demerger. That's a costly business. I hope the EU will give them 18 months to carry it out. They can give them anything between six to 18 months to demerge. Schneider Electric was last down 0.56 at 40.25 off an earlier low of 39.68 while Legrand was up 3.30 at
131.80. L'Oreal shares gained as investors hoped that they will be spared a profit warning from the luxury goods company at tomorrow's presentation of sales figures for the nine months to September, dealers said. "Following lower guidance from non-European cosmetics companies last week, we do not expect L'Oreal to follow suit, as the group should benefit from consumers potentially trading down from prestige to mass market," said Goldman Sachs analyst Jacques-Franck Dossin. L'Oreal was last up 1.15 at 81.30 mc/jad

Oct 10, 2001 (FWN Select via COMTEX) - Shares closed sharply higher in across-the-board gains underpinned by a strong performance on the US markets in early trading, with blue chip TMTs and TotalFinaElf leading the risers, dealers said.  Schneider  Electric was among the few losers, however, closing down on the day, after the EU refused to approved its merger with  Legrand, dealers added. The CAC-40 index finished up 142.41 at
4,319.38 Volume for the day was 3.68 bln euro. Among CAC-40 stocks, 38 closed higher and 2 closed lower. On the Matif, October CAC-40 futures on the Matif were trading up 128.00 at 4,315.0 while December 10-year
French government bond futures were 0.12 firmer at 90.00. The euro was last trading at 0.9126/28 compared with
0.9162/67 in late trade yesterday. Blue-chip TMTs soared in afternoon trade as investors piled back the market,
boosted by the positive open on the US markets although some dealers expressed surprise at the
across-the-board nature of the rally.

"It's madness! The market is not being very discerning at all. All the sectors are rising too quickly and there are no fundamentals underpinning the gains," said a dealer. Another dealersaid the lack of volume was distorting the gains seen today. "Volumes are modest. It doesn't take much at the moment to get shares moving significantly one way or another," the dealer said. In the TMT sector, media stocks saw some of the sharpest gains for the second consecutive session. Dealers said the sector remains one of the most undervalued on the market, which explained the investor rush to buy. Lagardere was one of the day's biggest gainers, closing up 2.80 eur or 8.04
pct at 37.64 after hitting a high of 38.44. "It's going up with the media stocks but it's outperforming today because it's catching up as it hasn't gained as much as other stocks in the sector in previous days." In the last week, Lagardere shares have risen around 14 pct in stark contrast to TF1 which has seen its share price soar by more than 39 pct. TF1 meanwhile extended gains seen yesterday, up 2.41 or 9.63 pct to 27.44. Other media stocks to show gains included M6, which climbed 1.99 to 21.72 andNRJ Groupe which ended the day up 1.38 at 14.63. Telecom stocks continued to perform well with France Telecom up 1.66 at 37.56 and Bouygues 1.78 higher at
32.30. Orange closed up 0.37 at 8.69 Alcatel also soared 1.26 or 10.09 pct to end the day at 13.75. Outside the TMT sector, Schneider Electric closed down 0.31 at 40.50 after the EU failed to give the go-ahead for its merger with Legrand. "It's very bad news indeed," said a Paris-based dealer. "There had been some hope the decision may be deferred pending further deliberations." "Now we're going to have a demerger. That's a costly business. I hope the EU will give them 18 months to carry it out. They can give them anything between six to 18 months to demerge. Schneider said it will appeal against the decision. Legrand shares closed up 2.50 at 131.00. TotalFinaElf, the most positive influence on the benchmark index, ended the day up 6.30 at 159.20 in line with other European oil stocks ahead of a likely meeting of OPEC members to discuss production cuts. Among second tier stocks, Rhodia soared 0.96 or 15.26 pct at 7.25 as rumours circulated that German giant BASF AG may be mulling a bid for its French rival, dealers said. Nexans fell sharply, closing down 0.20 at 15.00, after the company warned that profits on ordinary operations and net profit will fall in2001 compared with last year, because of a recent deterioration of its international business environment, dealers said. Shares in Eurotunnel SA closed down
0.02 at 0.73 after Eurostar Groupe, which operates passenger train services through the Channel Tunnel, reported a drop in passenger traffic in the third quarter, saying the outlook remains uncertain following the US terrorist attacks, dealers said. "The stock is certainly sensitive to recent events," said a dealer, "although using the tunnel probably remains a safer way to travel than by plane." Faurecia was down 2.25 or 4.19 pct at 51.50 after
the car parts manufacturer said it was forecasting a drop-off in activity as a number of car manufacturers cut back their production. mc/jkm/

EU rejects Schneider-Legrand deal.

BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it had rejected  Schneider Electric's 6.42 billion euro ($5.85 billion) bid to buy rival  Legrand and become the world's largest maker of low-voltage equipment.
"The European Commission has decided unanimously today to ban the merger between  Schneider  and
Legrand," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told a news conference.

He said the deal would have created dominant positions for the merged firm for various electrical products in different European countries.

The decision came despite pleas from top political and business leaders in France that rejection would lead to unemployment there. Monti opposed the deal because he said it would damage competition and harm consumers.

Schneider has already purchased 98.1 percent of the stock of Legrand. They had not been able to vote the stock while the deal was being reviewed and now they will have to sell it. Analysts say they will likely sell at a substantial loss.

The Commission was expected to negotiate timing issues on the sale of the stock and, if Schneider cannot sell its stock by the deadline, to appoint a trustee to divest it for them.

The company said it had offered 400 million euros ($365 million) of divestitures to solve problems, Le Monde reported last week. But the Commission said the issue was whether the divestitures could preserve competition, or might perish in the face of competing against the newly created giant.

UPDATE 1-EU blocks  electrical merger despite French lobbying.

BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The  European Commission, brushing aside intense French lobbying, on Wednesday blocked  Schneider  Electric's purchase of rival  Legrand to create a French electrical equipment giant.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog said, if permitted, the 6.42 billion euro ($5.85 billion) deal would have weakened competition in a number of countries, particularly in France.

"The European Commission has decided unanimously today to ban the merger between Schneider and Legrand," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told a news conference.

At 1011 GMT Schneider shares were down 0.86 percent at 40.46 euros, while Legrand shares were up 3.74 percent at 133.30 euros. France's blue-chip CAC 40 index was up 0.55 percent.

The decision, taken after an in-depth Commission probe, came despite pleas from top political and business leaders in France that rejection would lead to unemployment there.

French President Jacques Chirac and Finance Minister Laurent Fabius had both intervened personally in a vain bid to change the Commission's mind.

Schneider has already bought 98.1 percent of the stock of Legrand. It had not been able to exercise the voting rights while the deal was being reviewed and now will have to sell the stock, probably at a substantial loss, analysts said.

The Commission was expected to negotiate the timing of the sale of the stock and, if Schneider cannot sell by the deadline, to appoint a trustee to sell it for them.

In a statement, the Commission said that, despite the "scale and seriousness" of the problems posed by the merger, Schneider Electric did not put forward adequate undertakings to ensure effective competition.

The Commission said its investigation showed there were substantial overlaps between the businesses of Schneider and Legrand in the markets for electrical switchboards, wiring accessories and industrial products such as low-voltage transformers.

"In France, the merger gave rise to particularly serious problems over virtually the whole range of products concerned and would, in most cases, have resulted in the strengthening of a dominant position," the Commission said.
It also identified competition problems in Denmark, Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Britain.

The Commission said Schneider last month offered some concessions in a bid to win approval for the deal, but these did not go far enough to restore effective competition.

Schneider submitted new concessions on September 24 - after the deadline for doing so - but the Commission had doubts over their effectiveness.

The company said it had offered 400 million euros ($365 million) of divestment to solve problems, Le Monde reported last week.

UPDATE 2-EU blocks  electrical merger despite French lobbying.

(Adds comment by company, paragraphs 4, 10, 11, 12; updates stock reaction paragraph 5)

BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The  European Commission, brushing aside intense French lobbying, on Wednesday blocked  Schneider  Electric's purchase of rival  Legrand to create a French electrical equipment giant.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog ruled that if the 6.42 billion euro ($5.85 billion) deal went ahead it would have weakened competition in a number of EU countries, particularly in France.

"The European Commission has decided unanimously today to ban the merger between Schneider and Legrand," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told a news conference.

Schneider said it would appeal against the decision to the European Court of Justice "with the aim of preserving the rights of shareholders and employees".

Schneider shares were down 1.57 percent at 40.17 euros at 13:58 GMT, while Legrand shares were up 1.95 percent at 131.00 euros.

The decision, taken after an in-depth Commission probe, came despite pleas from top political and business leaders in France that rejection would lead to job losses there. The companies have a joint workforce of 97,200.

President Jacques Chirac and Finance Minister Laurent Fabius both intervened personally in a vain bid to change the Commission's mind.

Schneider has already bought 98.1 percent of the stock of Legrand. It had not been able to exercise the voting rights while the deal was being reviewed and now will have to sell the stock, probably at a substantial loss, analysts said.

The Commission was expected to discuss with the company the timing of the sale of the stock and, if Schneider cannot sell by the deadline, to appoint a trustee to do so.
However, Schneider signalled it was not yet ready to talk about selling its stock.
"Schneider Electric has decided ... to prepare the appropriate recourse to have its rights recognised by the
Tribunal of First Instance," the lower court of the European Court of Justice, it said in a statement.
That left open the possibility it might try to save the deal through the court, which would be a first.
The Commission said that despite the "scale and seriousness" of the problems posed by the merger, Schneider
Electric did not offer adequate undertakings to ensure effective competition.

The investigation found substantial overlaps between the businesses of Schneider and Legrand in markets for electrical switchboards, wiring accessories and industrial products such as low-voltage transformers, it said.

"In France, the merger gave rise to particularly serious problems over virtually the whole range of products concerned and would, in most cases, have resulted in the strengthening of a dominant position," the Commission said.

The company submitted further concessions on September 24 - after the deadline for doing so - but the
Commission had doubts about their effectiveness, Monti said.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Union Commission said Wednesday that it has blocked the acquisition of French electrical equipment group Legrand SA (F.LGR) by domestic rival electrical components maker Schneider Electric SA (F.SCN).

E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the proposed merger would have led to a dominant market position in France for electrical equipment.

Monti, speaking to reporters, said the planned tie-up would have led to the disappearance of one of the main competitors in the market for electrical equipment.

"All in all, the merger would have led to the disappearance of the main competitor in an already- concentrated market," Monti said.
The EUR7.9 billion merger was aimed at creating a world leader in low-voltage electrical equipment.

Monti said the Commission's decision was unanimous, adding that the merged company would have been in a position to block new entrants in France.

In the market for low voltage fuse boxes, Monti said the merger would have reinforced the company's dominant position in France and created a dominant position in Spain, Denmark and Italy.

"This is the 16th decision to ban a merger in 11 years, reflecting the fact that banning mergers remains a rare case," Monti said.

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- French electrical equipment maker  Schneider  Electric SA (F.SCN) said Wednesday that it is preparing to take its case to the European Court of Justice after the  European Union Commission blocked its merger with rival electrical equipment maker Legrand SA (F.LGR).

Schneider  also said it is studying with the E.U. Commission "practical ways in which effective competition could be reestablished."

This is in a bid to answer Commission concerns that a Schneider-Legrand tie-up would have too dominant a market position in France, Italy, Spain and Denmark.
In a statement, Schneider said it disagrees with the Commission's reasoning in blocking the merger.

"The tie-up of our two companies was aimed at creating a large global enterprise and would not--given the proposed asset sales--have created or reinforced a dominant market position in Europe or in any of its member states," the company said.

Schneider had proposed selling off businesses in France and Italy with a combined revenue of EUR400 million, but it wasn't enough to win Brussels' approval of the deal.

Schneider  Stuck Without  Strategy After Merger Blocked

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- As expected, the  European Union Commission Wednesday blocked French electrical equipment maker Schneider  Electric SA's (F.SCN) acquisition of domestic rival  Legrand SA (F.LGR.

The collapse of the merger, intended to create a world leader in low voltage power equipment, now leaves Schneider  searching for a new growth strategy as well as a buyer for  Legrand, which Schneider  must sell as a result of the E.U. decision. In what now looks an expensively misjudged gamble, Schneider  had acquired 98% of Legrand in anticipation of a favorable ruling.
"They underestimated the E.U., and now they're going to pay big time," said Romain Boscher, a fund manager at
Finama Asset Management.

E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the proposed merger would have led to a dominant market position in France for electrical equipment and the disappearance of one of the main competitors.

"All in all, the merger would have led to the disappearance of the main competitor in an already- concentrated market," Monti said.

Monti said the Commission's decision was unanimous, adding that the merged company would have been in a position to block new entrants into the French market.
Investors had expected the decision, slashing about 18% off Schneider's share price since Sept. 27, when
Schneider revealed the initial negative opinion of the E.U.'s mergers task force.

Analysts doubt there will be further downside from these levels, especially given speculation that both Schneider and Legrand are now themselves takeover targets.
Around 1340 GMT Schneider shares were trading down 1.6% or 66 cents to EUR40.15.

General Electric (GE), Siemens (SI) and Tyco International (TYC) are seen as best placed to scoop up one or the other of the French groups, as they have plenty of capacity to take on debt to finance the acquisition.
The only question now surrounds when, and under what conditions, Schneider will have to sell Legrand, said
Finama Asset Management's Boscher.

Legrand's market capitalization has sunk to EUR2.8 billion today, from a high of EUR5.5 billion after the merger was announced in January. Investment bank Societe Generale estimates that Schneider wouldn't get more than EUR4.5 billion for it today.

In a statement, Schneider said it was "preparing all appropriate action to enforce its rights at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg," adding that it was also "examining with the Commission practical ways in which effective competition could be re-established."

Schneider had banked on the acquisition to fuel future growth. At the time the merger was announced, Schneider said the combined group would have the financial resources "to grow all its businesses, particularly in high-growth markets."

Schneider boss Henri Lachmann said at the time: "The new group will have the resources to become an indisputable leader in each of its businesses and each of its major geographic markets."

Page 78 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Industry watchers put most of the blame for the merger's failure squarely on Lachmann's shoulders. Rather than wait for the E.U.'s decision before going forward, as steel group Usinor (F.USN) has done in its ongoing merger with Luxembourg's Arbed (L.ARB) and Spain's Aceralia (E.ACS), Schneider jumped the gun, maybe hoping a fait accompli would pressure the E.U. to OK the deal.

If that was Schneider's game, it backfired. Before the decision was announced, a spokesman didn't rule out the possibility of an appeal to the European Court of Justice, but analysts said that would only make a bad situation worse.

"Almost no one would expect them to win," said an analyst at a major French bank, advocating that the situation shouldn't be dragged out any longer than necessary.

A Schneider union representative said that a meeting with management to discuss the merger's failure is scheduled for early Thursday.

Rumors of a Schneider-Legrand tie up had been widespread in Paris for years before the two finally announced the merger in January. Schneider acquired a 98% stake in Legrand in August in a cash-and-shares offer worth EUR7.2 billion. When unveiled, the deal aimed to create a powerhouse in low voltage electrical fittings. It would have had annual revenue of EUR12.4 billion and about 94,000 employees worldwide.

COMPETITION - MONTI RETORTS "BIASED COMPETITION POLICY" CLAIMS.
429 words
10 October 2001
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2001 European Report.
European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti hit back at Finland's Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen in a speech in Helsinki on October 5. The Finn had accused  EU competition policy of being "biased to big countries". Mr Monti's speech came at a time when the  European authorities are pointing a finger at the  Schneider
Electric-Legrand merger (see separate article in this Section).

"Some voices, particularly in the Nordic countries, have recently questioned the way the Commission defines geographic markets because, they say, it could lead to discrimination towards small member States," said the EU's Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

"We do not discriminate against companies in small and large member States. Our objective is to protect consumers everywhere", said Mario Monti. "I believe this criticism is somehow flawed and could have negative implications," he retorted to the accusations.

He added that market definition is only "a cornerstone of competition policy," and that "what is ultimately important is to understand the nature of the competitive situation facing the firms involved in a certain practice or in a proposed merger."

The Commission's objective in defining geographic markets is "simply to identify the competitive constraints that the companies concerned will face. We in fact apply the same criteria all across the Union. Some of our critics, however, believe that it is precisely we apply the same rules everywhere companies from small member States, by preventing them from merging domestically".

The Commissioner said he believed that companies could acquire the "necessary dimension" not only by "dominating their national market." He said he believed companies in small member States have other means of growing and of becoming competitive world-wide, than a merger with another leading company from the same member State.
He listed three possibilities:
1. A company can grow internally. "Our rules do not oppose that a company becomes dominant in its own
national market," i.e. only if it reaches such a position by offering lower prices or better products and services than
its competitors.
2. Companies can expand by merging with companies that operate in other countries.

3. Finally, domestic mergers are not entirely excluded, that is, when they do not lead to "excessively high" market shares or, even in cases of relatively high market shares, when the market in question is "open enough".
In addition to these "reflections", Mr Monti added that market definitions are not "immutable" and that they can
"change in time". In the end, the European consumer is the one to benefit from merger control, he concluded.

ELECTRONIC INDUSTRY - SIEMENS DENIES LOBBYING BRUSSELS ON SCHNEIDER-LEGRAND MERGER.
419 words
10 October 2001
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2001 European Report.
Siemens, the German electronics and engineering group, has denied having lobbied Brussels on the  Schneider Electric-Legrand merger. The two companies merged in the mistaken belief that they would receive approval from the European Commission for the merger. The Commission is expected to hand in its decision this week. Executives of both electrical equipment groups are now concerned that their companies will be easy take-over prey for foreign groups, namely Siemens or General Electric, if they are expected to unwind the deal.

"It's absurd to even think we intervened with the European competition authorities. The Commission takes independent decisions. We would never push the Commission into taking a decision going our way," said Peter Gottal a Siemens representative in Munich, Germany. Mr Gottal did not however care to explain what he meant by "our way": for or against the merger? According to the French daily paper, Le Monde, dated October 8, Siemens would be interested in taking over part of the companies' assets, were the merger to take place.Mr
Gottal did admit, however, that a couple of Siemens' chief experts were kindly asked to come to Brussels to share their views on a possible Euro 8 billion merger between Schneider and Legrand.

"This is standard procedure," admitted Amelia Torres, spokesperson for the EU Commissioner. Indeed, the Commission consults competitors, suppliers, customers, consumer organisations, etc., to help it take its decision on whether to let a merger take place or not.

The Commission publishes a summary of every notification filed for clearance in its Official Journal. Interested parties have 10 days to come forward and give their views on the matter. If the Commission decides to start an independent investigation, it may also send extra questionnaires (on technical details, product substitutability, etc.), and will establish a product and geographic market definition.

Mr Monti, it is believed, is expected to rule against the merger on the grounds that it creates a dominant situation for the two companies in individual European member States.

The same principle led the Commission to rule against the Euro 12 billion merger last month of two Swedish banks, SEB and Fireningssparbanken, and last year against the planned merger of Sweden's Volvo and Scania. Recent accusations made by Nordic countries, namely Finland, led Commissioner Monti to explain, during a speech on market definition in Helsinki, the decisions he had taken at the time (see separate article in this Section on Mr Monti's speech).

EU tightens competition grip on corporate giants
683 words
10 October 2001

AFPR
English
(Copyright 2001)
BRUSSELS, October 10 (AFP) - The  European Commission blocked on Wednesday a French electronics
merger and fined DaimlerChrysler for impeding cross-border car sales, two demonstrations of its determination to
police competition.

The commission unanimously vetoed a proposed merger of French companies  Schneider  Electric and  Legrand, which would have created the world's largest maker of low-voltage electrical equipment and industrial automated equipment, Monti announced.

And it imposed a fine of 71.825 million euros on German-US automaker DaimlerChysler for unfair competition in the European distribution of Mercedes cars and trucks.
This puts the company third on a penalty list led by German auto giant Volkswagen.

VW was fined 102 million euros in 1998 for practices aimed at restricting distribution, and retained the top spot even after the fine was reduced to 90 million euros in 2000.

Tetra Pak, the Swedish beverage packager, was slapped with a fine of 75 million euros in 1991 for abusing its dominant market position.

In 10 years, the commission has blocked 16 planned mergers, including several major tie-ups involving companies based outside the European Union, and levied heavy fines for antitrust violations by EU firms.

The commission is empowered by European law to rule on mergers by groups with combined global sales exceeding five billion euros (4.6 billion dollars) and which separately have sales within the 15- member union of more than 250 million euros.
European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said on Wednesday that DaimlerChrysler had broken
"fundamental rules of competition" within the EU.

"Consumers strongly and rightfully criticize the functioning of the single market if they are unable to find an official distributor which is willing to supply them, or if they are discriminated against in relation to national customers," said Monti.

He referred to one of DaimlerChryslers' competition violations; instructing dealers to demand foreign consumers pay a 15-percent deposit to DaimlerChrysler when ordering a car in Germany.

The commission may levy a multi-billion-euro (dollar) fine on US software giant Microsoft and force it to drop features from its new Windows XP operating system, a report by the Wall Street Journal Europe said Wednesday.

The commission has also demonstrated it is ready to block global deals if it finds they offer unfair advantages to the companies concerned.

He said the "rivalry" between Schneider and Legrand was "the mainstay of competition" in their market, in France and in several other EU countries as well.

"The merger would have eliminated one of the most important competitions in an already concentrated market," he said.

The commission killed a megamerger between US groups General Electric and Honeywell International on July 3, saying the 45- billion-dollar deal would have slashed competition in the aerospace sector.

Page 86 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It marked the first time that a US corporate merger had been blocked solely by EU authorities, and both companies have challenged the decision in separate petitions before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

On June 28, 2000 the commission decided formally to block a merger of US telecommunications giants MCI Worldcom and Sprint, even though they had already announced they were dropping the plan because of EU opposition.

Monti hailed "very good cooperation" between EU and US officials in the case and said the merger would have produced "a company whose size would have given it a dominant position in the information transmission market on the Internet."

On April 24, 1996 the commission killed a deal between South African mining groups Gencor and Lonrho, which the EU said would result in a domination of the platinum and rhodium markets.

Gencor later argued that the commission directives did not concern countries outside the 15-nation EU and stressed that the mining operations were all in Africa.

However, a chamber of the EU European Court court ruled in March 1999 that the decision was not determined by the place of production, but by the market in which the metals were sold.
Sales by Lonrho and Gencor in Europe are well above the 250- million-euro limit set by European law. wai/hd

EU Commission bans Schneider-Legrand merger

ATTENTION - ADDS reaction by  Schneider-Legrand

BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (AFP) - The European Commission unanimously vetoed on Wednesday a merger of French companies Schneider  Electric and Legrand, which would have created the world leader in low- voltage electrical equipment and industrial automated equipment, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.
Both groups quickly "contested the foundation" underlying the decision, and said they would appeal it to the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Monti said the "rivalry" between Schneider and Legrand was "the mainstay of competition" in their market, in
France and in several other EU countries as well.

"The merger would have eliminated one of the most important competitions in an already concentrated market," he said.
"It would have put wholesalers in a very delicate" supply position, he said.

The two companies said in a statement: "Schneider Electric and Legrand take notice of this decision, of which they contest the foundation."

Industrial and strategic interest of the deal -- close to finalisation since late July when Schneider obtained 98.1 percent of Legrand as the result of a public offer -- was beyond question, the companies said in a joint statement.
Schneider has decided "to prepare appropriate recourse to have its rights recognized by the European Court of
Justice in Luxembourg," the statement said.

However, the French company will also examine with the Commission practical means of reestablishing effective competition, it added.

Monti recalled earlier that the veto was the 16th imposed by the commission since it was given merger and acquisition jurisdiction in 1990.
In Paris the price of shares in Schneider Electric fell by 1.47 percent to 40.21 euros, while Legrand stock rose by
1.79 percent to 130.80 euros.

"It's very bad news indeed," said a Paris-based dealer. "There had been some hope the decision may be deferred pending further deliberations."

"Now we're going to have a demerger. That's a costly business. I hope the EU will give them 18 months to carry it out. They can give them anything between six to 18 months to demerge.

"Despite the scale and seriousness of the problems proposed by the merger, Schneider Electric did not put forward in good time adequate undertakings to ensure that, following the merger, the conditions of effective competition would be restored to the benefit of consumers...," said Monti.

ATTENTION - UPDATES with  Schneider,  DaimlerChrysler appeals

BRUSSELS, October 10 (AFP) - The  European Commission flexed its power to police competition on Wednesday, blocking a French electronics merger and fining DaimlerChrysler for impeding cross- border car sales.

The commission unanimously vetoed a proposed merger of French companies  Schneider  Electric and  Legrand, which would have created the world's largest maker of low-voltage electrical equipment and industrial automated equipment, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti announced.

And it imposed a fine of 71.825 million euros (65.53 million dollars) on German-US automaker DaimlerChysler for unfair competition in the European distribution of Mercedes cars and trucks.

"fundamental rules of competition" within the EU.

"Consumers strongly and rightfully criticize the functioning of the single market if they are unable to find an official distributor which is willing to supply them, or if they are discriminated against in relation to national customers," said Monti.

He referred to one of DaimlerChryslers' competition violations: instructing dealers to demand foreign consumers pay a 15-percent deposit to DaimlerChrysler when ordering a car in Germany.

DaimlerChrysler said it considered the commission's findings "unfounded" and that it would challenge the decision.

The commission has also demonstrated it is ready to block global deals if it finds they offer unfair advantages to the companies concerned.
Monti said the "rivalry" between Schneider and Legrand was "the mainstay of competition" in their market, in
France and in several other EU countries as well.

"The merger would have eliminated one of the most important competitions in an already concentrated market," he said.

Schneider said that it would appeal the decision, which could cost shareholders dearly because the company has already acquired 98 percent of Legrand's capital, making it costly to disentangle the two groups.
According to press reports earlier this week, French President Jacques Chirac and Finance Minister Laurent
Fabius personally intervened to argue for European Commission approval of the deal.
US giant General Electric and German industrial group Siemens were reported to be possible predators if the EU
blocked the merger.

Brussels, 09/10/2001 (Agence  Europe) - Sources close to the Commission have suggested that the  European Commission is preparing to give a negative ruling on Wednesday to the planned merger between French electrical equipment companies  Schneider  and Legrand, a decision taken "without discussion", which means that the efforts by the French Finance Minster, Laurent Fabius, to persuade Commissioner Monti of the merits of the merger appear to have failed.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission said Wednesday it has blocked the proposed purchase
of French electrical equipment group Legrand SA by domestic electrical components rival  Schneider  Electric SA.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the merger of the two main French producers of low-voltage electrical equipment "would have led to the disappearance of a main competitor in this already concentrated market."

The 7.9 billion euro (dlrs 7.2 billion) merger was aimed at creating a world leader in low-voltage electrical equipment such as fuse boxes, plugs, switches and other electrical equipment around the house. The companies also produce systems used for electricity distribution and the control of electrical circuits in buildings and factories.

In March, EU regulators opened an in-depth investigation into the Schneider-Legrand merger amid concerns over the companies' strong market positions in the low-voltage electricity distribution market both at the national and European level.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission flexed its power to police competition yesterday, unwinding a French electronics merger and fining DaimlerChrysler AG for impeding cross-border car sales.

The Commission unanimously vetoed a proposed merger of French companies  Schneider  Electric SA and Legrand SA, which would have created the world's largest maker of low-voltage electrical equipment and industrial automated equipment.

And it imposed a fine of 71.825 million euros ($65.53-million U.S.) on German-U.S. auto maker DaimlerChysler for unfair competition in the European distribution of Mercedes cars and trucks.

In the past decade, the Commission has blocked 16 planned mergers, including several major tie-ups involving companies based outside the European Union, and levied heavy fines for antitrust violations by EU firms.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said yesterday that DaimlerChrysler had broken "fundamental rules of competition" within the EU.

"A new car is an expensive purchase and consumers pay attention to prices," he said. "The Commission is determined to ensure that they benefit from competition at retail level and get a good deal."

DaimlerChrysler said it considered the Commission's findings "unfounded" and that it would challenge the decision.

The Commission has also demonstrated it is ready to block global deals if it finds they offer unfair advantages to the companies concerned.
Mr. Monti said the "rivalry" between Schneider and Legrand was "the mainstay of competition" in their market, in
France and in several other European Union countries as well.

"The merger would have eliminated one of the most important competitions in an already concentrated market," he said.

Schneider said that it would appeal the decision, which could cost shareholders dearly because the company has already acquired 98 per cent of Legrand's capital, making it costly to disentangle the two groups.
According to press reports earlier this week, French President Jacques Chirac and Finance Minister Laurent
Fabius personally intervened to argue for Commission approval of the deal.

THE EUROPEAN Commission, brushing aside intense French lobbying, yesterday blocked  Schneider  Electric's purchase of its rival  Legrand to create a French electrical equipment giant. The  European Union's anti-trust watchdog ruled that if the 6.42bn euro (#3.8bn) deal went ahead it would have weakened competition in several EU countries, particularly France.  Schneider,  which already controls 98.1 per cent of  Legrand's shares, said it would appeal against the decision.

EU's Monti-Schneider-Legrand deal must not go ahead.

ANTWERP, Belgium, Oct 11 (Reuters) -  European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti ruled out on Thursday the possibility of renewed negotiations with  Schneider  Electric to complete its acquisition of fellow French electrical equipment maker  Legrand.

He said the only subject for negotiation was how to make sure the deal, which the  European Commission blocked on Wednesday, does not go through.
"A deal which has not been authorised must first of all not be in place," Monti said.

"We will work with the parties to examine as soon as possible the modalities for the merger not to be implemented," Monti told a news conference when asked whether there was any chance for the two companies to discuss a new way of achieving their merger.

Monti also expressed dismay that Schneider had acquired 98 percent of Legrand before the merger was implemented.

"One of the parties owns almost the totality of shares in the other party and clearly we have to make sure, having prohibited the merger, that the merger does not take place," he said.

Monti's comments appeared to scotch reports that the European Commission may have left the door open to a renegotiation of the deal.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog ruled on Wednesday that if the 6.42 billion euro ($5.85 billion) deal went ahead it would have weakened competition in a number of EU countries, particularly in France.

ANALYSIS-Schneider's chances in court appeal seen slim.
By Tom Pfeiffer
680 words

PARIS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A threat by Schneider  Electric SA to take  European Union regulators to court to overturn a veto on its acquisition of Legrand SA would have virtually no chance of success, analysts and a lawyer said on Thursday.

Announcing the ban on Wednesday, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said  Schneider-Legrand controls up to 90 percent of some European markets for electrical sockets and switches and was left unimpressed by Schneider's  offer to sell 400 million euros of assets. Still smarting from the rejection,  Schneider on Wednesday said it was planning to lodge an appeal at the  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

In doing so, the Paris-based company would a queue of companies lining up in the vain hope the court will break the habit of a lifetime and overrule Europe's top competition official.

Among those waiting are General Electric Co and Honeywell International Inc., UK holiday operators Airtours Plc and First Choice Holidays Plc and U.S. phone giants WorldCom Inc. and Sprint Corp..
"It will take at least one to two years to render a decision and it is very unlikely that the court is going to annul the
Commision's decision," said Jacques Buhart, a partner with legal advisers Coudert Brothers in Brussels.

Monti has become used to having his resolve tested by far larger affairs than Schneider-Legrand, the biggest being the planned purchase of Honeywell by General Electric and of Sprint by WorldCom.

In both cases he held out against enormous diplomatic pressure. In the case of Legrand, he parried appeals from French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius and even a phone call to his boss, Commission President Romano Prodi, from French President Jacques Chirac.

On Thursday Monti ruled out the possibility of renewed negotiations and said any discussions with Schneider would be aimed at making sure the deal does not go through.
STALLING FOR TIME

So does Schneider really think it stands a chance facing Monti across a court room? Though Schneider says the Commission may have not followed correct procedure in its deliberation, outsiders say this may all be a delaying tactic.

"The court case idea may simply be intended to put pressure on the Commission to reconsider, though they probably know that is very unlikely to happen," said one Paris-based analyst who requested anonymity. "They are probably trying to stall for time before having to sell Legrand."

Schneider faces three unpalatable options for getting rid of Legrand. It could sell it directly to a competitor, though most of those are busy worrying about their existing businesses as the global economic slowdown bites.

It could relist Legrand shares in the market, or spin the company off by distributing new shares in both companies to Schneider shareholders. Schneider has 98 percent of Legrand.

The Commission said in its ruling on Wednesday that it "is prepared to examine the practical arrangements for restoring effective competition", indicating it may allot Schneider some time to prepare an organised sale.


Page 98 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
With European stock markets wallowing near three-year lows, Legrand could fetch as little as 3.6 billion euros if sold tomorrow, compared to the 7.2 billion euros including debt that Schneider paid originally.

Two potential buyers, General Electric and Siemens AG, have said they are not interested in acquisitions of low voltage equipment makers.
Honeywell is in the midst of a massive job cutting drive as it struggles to adapt to the economic slowdown.

So analysts say the longer Schneider can hold onto its Legrand shares, the better the price it could eventually get.
What is more, bringing a case to court in Luxembourg can be done at a fraction of the price in London or New
York, so Schneider has little to lose.

"The reason they would appeal to the court of first instance is purely an issue of principle," said lawyer Buhart. "They would do this to satisfy shareholders, the media and their ego."

UPDATE 1-EU's Monti-Schneider-Legrand deal must not go ahead.

ANTWERP, Belgium, Oct 11 (Reuters) -  European competition chief Mario Monti, using firm language, on Thursday appeared to rule out renewed negotiations with  Schneider  Electric to let it acquire rival French electrical equipment maker  Legrand. "A deal which has not been authorised must first of all not be in place," he said.

Monti's statement appeared to clarify an ambiguous Commission statement made 24 hours earlier when it announced it was blocking the deal to create a French national champion.

Then, it seemed to leave the door open for new talks, saying it was "prepared to examine the practical arrangements for restoring effective competition".
After that, a flurry of rumours from Paris raised the possibility that a new deal might be forged in talks with
Brussels. But Monti seemed firm in his views at a news conference after a speech in Antwerp.

"It is in the letter and the spirit of the merger regulation that the authorisation has to come before the merger is implemented," Monti said when asked whether Schneider-Legrand could renegotiate the deal.

Monti expressed dismay that Schneider had acquired 98.1 percent of Legrand before the merger was implemented.

"Here we have a situation where one of the parties owns almost the totality of the shares of the other party. And clearly we have to make sure, having prohibited the merger, that the merger does not take place and that conditions of effective competition are established," he said.

"We will with the parties examine as soon as possible the modalities for the merger not to be implemented," he said.

The Commission decision had come in the face of intense lobbying, including personal intervention by both President Jacques Chirac and Finance Minister Laurent Fabius in a vain attempt to change the Commission's views.

The top French politicians are said to have raised the danger to jobs, because the two companies combined employ more than 97,200 people, but the Commission made it clear the interests of consumers came first.
It ruled that if the 6.42-billion-euro ($5.85 billion) deal went ahead then competition would be weakened across
Europe and prices might rise, to the detriment of customers.
Schneider said on Wednesday it would appeal against the Commission's decision to the European Court of
Justice "with the aim of preserving the rights of shareholders and employees".
In the meantime, it cannot exercise voting rights at Legrand and has not moved to integrate Legrand's facilities. Any sale of Legrand's stock will likely be at a substantial loss, analysts have said.

EU Monti: Must Ensure Schneider/Legrand Merger Not Occur

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)-  European Union Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said Thursday that the Commission must ensure that French electrical equipment maker  Schneider  Electric SA (F.SCN) not go through with its acquisition of domestic rival  Legrand SA (F.LGR).
"Having prohibited the merger, we have to ensure that the merger doesn't take place," Monti told journalists. On Wednesday, Monti said the proposed merger would have led to a dominant market position in France for
electrical equipment and the disappearance of one of the main competitors.

The collapse of the merger, intended to create a world leader in low voltage power equipment, now leaves Schneider searching for a new growth strategy as well as a buyer for Legrand, which Schneider must sell as a result of the E.U. decision.

In what now looks an expensively misjudged gamble, Schneider had acquired 98% of Legrand in anticipation of a favorable ruling.

Companies: Schneider  Stuck After Blocked  Deal
By David Woodruff

PARIS --  Schneider  Electric SA was left with few options after the  European Commission officially blocked its
6.4 billion euros merger with  Legrand SA, as expected.

The French maker of low-voltage electrical equipment said it is weighing an appeal of the decision with the European Court of Justice. However, an appeal could take years, legal experts say. At best, they say, a legal fight might buy  Schneider  some time before the company is forced to sell the 98% stake it already holds in Legrand.

The companies would need at least 18 months to organize such a sale, given the depressed state of world equity markets, say people familiar with their thinking. Analysts estimate Legrand could be valued at as little as 4.5
billion euros at the moment.

In Paris trading, Schneider shares fell 31 European cents to 40.50 euros, while Legrand dropped 1.9%, or 2.50 euros, to 131 euros.

Company officials expect to meet in the coming days with Mario Monti, the competition commissioner, to discuss how to proceed. In theory, the companies could come back and seek approval for a substantially different deal, but in other cases the commission has cast doubt on the usefulness of such a move. The most likely outcome, say people familiar with the situation, is a time-table for Schneider's divestiture of Legrand.

Schneider's options for unloading Legrand run from an outright sale to issuing to Schneider stockholders new shares in both Schneider and Legrand.

The commission killed the merger because European Union antitrust watchdogs said it would have created a company strong enough to lock competitors out of its home market in France. Moreover, it would have held a dominant position in other European countries for certain products, such as switches.

The decision came despite personal lobbying by French President Jacques Chirac and French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius. In addition, Schneider Chairman Henri Lachmann spent much of the last week in Brussels pressing the company's case with individual commissioners.

Schneider has said it went ahead with the Legrand acquisition in August after the company thought antitrust officials expressed a willingness to approve the deal after some concessions were made. On Wednesday the commission scolded the company for waiting too late in the merger-review process to address concerns it would create an overly dominant player.

(EU) EU/COMPETITION - Commission refuses  Schneider/Legrand merger.
680 words
11 October 2001
Agence Europe
AGEU
English
(c) 2001 Agence EUROPE, Brussels Not Available for Re-dissemination. .
Brussels, 10/10/2001 (Agence Europe) - It came as no surprise when the Commission decided to prohibit the merger between the Schneider  Electric and  Legrand groups, the two main French manufacturers of electrical equipment. Commissioner Mario Monti told the press that the decision was unanimous. The merger would have given rise to a heavyweight that would have considerably weakened the operation of the market for electrical equipment in many countries, including France where the two partners were hitherto the mainstay of competition. Mr Monti deplored the fact that, aware of the serious competition problems caused by the concentration, Schneider  and Legrand were not able to put forward in good time adequate undertakings to ensure effective competition conditions. This is the sixteenth operation banned by the Commission since the entry into force of the
1990 Regulation on Mergers, out of the 1800 merger projects submitted to it for approval.

Notified on 16 February this year, the operation had given rise to a large number of questions at the Commission, which had decided, on 30 March, to open a detailed investigation. The negative effect of the merger above all concerned ll low voltage electrical equipment, that is, all the systems used for the distribution of electricity and the control of electrical circuits in homes, offices or factories. Such equipment covers many different types of
products, ranging from electrical distribution boards and sockets and switches to cable trays. More especially, the merger would have given rise to combined market shares of between 40% and 70% depending on the country on the electrical switchboard markets and from 40% to 90% on the market for wiring accessories, as well as substantial market shares for some other products for industrial use or for more specific applications. Such a situation would have raised serious problems in France for almost all the products concerned. Obvious competition distortion would have been produced in Denmark, Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom. In order to remedy this, Schneider had submitted an in initial series of undertakings to the Commission on 14 September 2001, the deadline for presenting undertakings. These initial undertakings, however, did not calm the Commission's fears. In the same way, other proposals presented ten days later were not accepted by
the Commission. Mr Monti recalled in this connection that so-called "last minute" undertakings, that is after the date of submission, could be accepted exceptionally if they immediately and beyond a shadow of a doubt restored free competition conditions. In the case in question, however, factual uncertainties linked to the fact that these were last minute proposals were not clarified in the necessary time. Mr Monti said that "this unfortunate outcome illustrates the absolute need for the partners in a merger which involves clear competition problems to give thought, at a very early stage in the project, to possible remedies and to enter into discussion without delay with the competition authorities". The Commission also stressed the additional difficulties raised at competition level by a concentration between two companies from one and the same State aiming to create a "national champion". In some cases, for example, the merger between TotalFina and Elf, the operation is authorised as long as strict guarantees such as equitable consumer price levels continue or are swiftly re-established.

In other cases, as in the case of Volvo and Scania, this was not possible. Speaking of the particular conditions in which merger had been envisaged (Schneider had, after the public exchange offer, claimed 98% of Legrand's shares), Mr Monti declared that the Commission was "willing to examine the practical arrangements for rebuilding effective competition conditions". Schneider feared being compelled by the Commission to sell up shares
acquired in Legrand.

Reacting immediately to the European veto, the French groups declared that they challenged the validity of the decision. Schneider Electric decided, moreover, to safeguard the rights of its shareholders and its employees, and to prepare all appropriate appeals for having its rights recognised at the Court of First Instance of the European Communities in Luxembourg.

COMMISSION STOPS SALE OF LEGRAND TO SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC.

The European Commission announced on October 10 that it is blocking the merger of  Schneider  Electric and Legrand, France's two biggest electrical equipment manufacturers. It gave as its reason the fact that the deal would have "considerably weakened the operation of the market" in several countries, and especially France. It describes the two companies' rivalry as "the mainstay of competition" in the country. Competition problems with the merger deal were also identified in Denmark, Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom. Schneider  told the Commission in February that it intended to take over Legrand and by July the companies had finished their exchange of shares. This left  Schneider  in control of about 98% of Legrand's shares.

An initial Commission investigation found that the merged firm would control 40-70% of the market (depending on the country) for electrical switchboards, 40-90% for wiring accessories, and that "substantial overlaps" existed between their production in other areas. In response to the Commission's criticisms, Schneider twice submitted compromise proposals, on September 14 and 24, to meet its competition criteria. However, both sets of concessions were rejected to the Commission. It is now "prepared to examine the practical arrangements for restoring effective competition", given that Schneider has already bought almost all of Legrand's shares.The merger would create the world's largest electrical systems group, with a Euro 12.4 billion turnover and a
workforce of 94,000. The companies had already during their negotiations with the Commission to dispose of assets worth Euro 400 million in France and Italy. Shares in both companies fell by around 20% on September 28 as the market reacted badly following the news of the very likely failure of the merger. "The drop in shares is inherent in a share offer that they made. I cannot imagine that the companies, which are in a strong position in the market, did not take this possibility into account when they structured the deal", said a Commission spokesman...JJ:(HB)

Why it does not pay to second-guess  Europe's antitrust regulators

RARELY has a merger been so accident-prone. When  Schneider  announced its euro7.2 billion ($6.6 billion) takeover of  Legrand, a local French rival, in January, it created the world's biggest maker of household electrical equipment and won plaudits for reshaping an industry. From there it has been downhill all the way. A bust-up in the spring led to legal challenges from holders of preference shares, forcing  Schneider  to add a cash sweetener to its all-share offer. That was as nothing compared with the knock-out blow this week: the  European Commission blocked the deal, claiming it would harm competition.

This would be bad enough in any circumstances. What makes it disastrous for the companies is that they have already merged. They will now have to prise themselves apart, with great difficulty and at great cost. They had charged into each other's arms, confident that regulators would wave the deal through. But executives grossly underestimated the concerns it would raise, and they were also caught out by a legal quirk: in France, merger agreements cannot be made conditional on antitrust approval.

Things started to go wrong in September when the commission's experts latched on to the new company's dominant position in various national markets for such things as circuit breakers, which are required by law in homes and factories. The regulators had taken soundings from Schneider's rivals, such as Germany's Siemens, which argued that the merger would lead to higher prices. Schneider then offered to sell businesses with turnover of euro400m, and lobbied frantically to salvage the deal. So did France's politicians, who had been looking
forward to the creation of a new national champion: President Jacques Chirac even put in a call to Romano Prodi, the commission's president. He received the same polite but firm reply as those American politicians who pressed the commission on behalf of GE and Honeywell earlier this year.

Schneider is clearly shocked by the decision, calling it &#8220;incomprehensible&#8221;. It claims that the commission gave no hint that it would object on principle&#8212;a charge that Mario Monti, the competition commissioner, has strongly denied. Schneider's options are now equally awful: either to sell Legrand to a rival, or to relist it on the stockmarket. Analysts calculate that Schneider is likely to lose euro2 billion-3 billion on the sale, even if regulators give it a few months' breathing-space. The commission has not completely ruled out renegotiation of the deal, though few think this likely.

Once they break apart, Schneider and Legrand will both become takeover targets. Possible buyers include Tyco and Emerson, both American. Siemens is less keen to expand in this area, but it may be tempted by a fire-sale price. There is even talk of a bid from GE or Honeywell. It would be ironic were Mr Monti inadvertently to help either of the duo whose marriage plans he broke up so spectacularly only a few months ago.

ELECTRONIC INDUSTRY - SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC-LEGRAND MERGER BLOCKED BY BRUSSELS.
557 words
13 October 2001
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2001 European Report.
The European Commission blocked the merger between the two electrical equipment groups  Schneider  Electric and Legrand, on October 10. One major problem, however, springs to eye: Schneider  Electric already holds a
98 % stake in Legrand. Now the French maker of low-voltage electrical equipment, Schneider  Electric, is weighing an appeal of the decision with the  European Court of Justice. But, the company also said it was readying itself for talks with the Commission on how to "re-establish effective competition."

The merger would have "considerably weakened the operation of the market in a number of countries, particularly in France", esteemed the European Commission on October 10. Moreover, it would have held a dominant
position in other European countries for certain products such as switches.

In France, the merger gave rise to particularly serious problems over virtually the whole range of products concerned, from electrical switchboards, wiring accessories, industrial pushbuttons and low-voltage transformers to more specific applications such as emergency lighting, and would have resulted in the strengthening of a dominant position. Being by far the largest players on the French market, a merger between Schneider and Legrand would have left "little prospect of any significant development in the activity of foreign competitors in the short and medium term". Competition problems were also identified in Denmark, Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom.Schneider Electric had already submitted a series of initial undertakings to the Commission to remedy these competition problems, but they were not sufficient to restore the conditions of "effective competition". On October 10, the Commission even scolded the company for waiting too late in the merger review process to address concerns it would create an overly dominant player.
Schneider's proposed take-over of Legrand was notified to the Commission on February 16, 2001 and a
second-stage detailed investigation was initiated on March 30. The public offer of exchange of shares announced
by Schneider on January 15 was closed on July 25. The two companies merged in the mistaken belief that they
would receive approval from the European Commission for the merger. The decision came despite personal
lobbying by French President Jacques Chirac and his Finance minister Laurent Fabius. Executives of both
electrical equipment groups are now concerned that their companies will be easy take-over prey for foreign
groups.The EU Competition commissioner Mario Monti denied the rumours according to which Schneider Electric
would be renegotiating the terms of the merger to make it EU compliant. "An unauthorised deal must not take
place," declared Mr Monti at the fourth "European Competition Day" which took place in Antwerp on October 11.
To unwind the deal, the companies could demerge through a distribution of Legrand shares to Schneider holders.

Mr Monti also proned discussions between all parties at an early stage when discussing acquisition possibilities between companies. "We prone pre-pre-pre notification," he said during his speech in Antwerp, indirectly referring to the recent Schneider Electric-Legrand case.

Also speaking at the fourth "European Competition Day" held in Antwerp, Christa Randzio-Plath (PES Group, Germany), chairwoman of the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, said that "efforts to increase the transparency of European competition policy are indispensable if European citizens are to understand, accept and support this important policy area".

The Schneider  board is due to meet on October 19 to examine ways for the French electrical equipment maker to relinquish control of  Legrand. Schneider  owns 98% of Legrand. After blocking the merger last week, European Commissioner Mario Monti said he planned to work with the parties to examine as soon as possible the details of how the operation will be stopped.

One option is the sale of all or part of the Legrand shares to a timescale to be negotiated with Brussels. Another is a demerger, which would involve giving current Schneider  shareholders shares in Schneider  and Legrand. The third solution, in which  Schneider  still appeared to have confidence before the weekend, is renegotiating a link-up with Brussels, but under very different terms.

Schneider  deal blocked.

There are harsh lessons to be learned, writes James Rossiter

Schneider  has become the latest victim of Brussels' intransigence. At least that is how France's largest electrical goods manufacturer views the  European Competition Commission's decision last week to veto a merger with Legrand, its smaller French counterpart.

Schneider, Legrand and their advisers are keen to paint a picture of misrepresentation on the part of the commission. One adviser says: "From the moment the deal was announced in February to the time it finally completed, the commission had misled both companies about its level of anti-trust concerns over a merged company. Although nothing was in writing, it gave the distinct impression that it would allow the merger. Either that or the companies and the lawyers have completely misread the signs."

Schneider took European competition advice from Allen & Overy's Brussels office, led by Jacques Steinbergen. Legrand was advised by Robert Saint-Esteben of Bredin Prat, a Paris law firm which advises on many of France's largest deals. Both firms declined to comment.

Legrand and Schneider could have signed a non-binding agreement to merge and waited until they had obtained competition approval before formally merging through an exchange of shares.

French stock exchange regulations prevent a potential acquirer of a French-listed company inserting a clause in its offer document that makes completion conditional on prior anti-trust approval. Schneider's decision to complete the merger before obtaining approval is not unusual, but companies normally take this approach confident in the knowledge that they will obtain anti-trust clearance.

Rothschild and Credit Suisse First Boston, Schneider's joint financial advisers, have distanced themselves from the decision to merge before obtaining formal approval from the competition authorities. Both companies had an opportunity to delay the merger in May. At that point Schneider's offer was suspended after court action by minority holders of preferred shares in Legrand - shares which bear a higher dividend than ordinary shares but with no voting rights attached.
One Schneider adviser says: "We suggested delaying the revised offer then until after we had obtained EU
clearance. But Schneider gave in to Legrand's demands that we should press ahead.

"One of the main reasons for merging in the first place was to make both companies less vulnerable to takeover approaches, so any talk of delay was just pushed aside from the agenda. The deal had already taken longer than expected thanks to the court action."

In May, Schneider, Legrand and their lawyers talked again with the commission. Again they interpreted the commission's verbal comments as positive. Rothschild and CSFB busied themselves with the complex task of repricing the offer to Legrand ordinary and preferred shareholders. They left competition issues to the companies and their lawyers. "Maybe there was an unwillingness on the part of the companies to deal with the issues head on," one deal source says.

Schneider offered to make an extra E400m of divestures two weeks ago after the merger task force gave a negative preliminary report on the merger. This failed to satisfy the authorities. Mario Monti, EU Competition Commissioner, says that the deal would have created dominant positions for the merged firm for various electrical products in different European countries.



Page 110 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
However, the Commission added that it would consider proposals because Schneider had already acquired 98% of Legrand's stock. Schneider wants to avoid a demerger or a trade sale of Legrand. Either way the company will lose money and be left vulnerable to takeover.

Schneider sources say that the company will appeal to the European Court of Justice against the EC's decision. This would buy Schneider valuable time, as the timetable for divesting Legrand or selling parts of the combined Schneider Legrand group would be suspended until judgment is handed down, which could take over a year. The delay would allow Schneider to wait for a better price in a trade sale than it would achieve under current market conditions.

Whether Schneider has been unfairly treated by the commission is a moot point. One deal source says: "It was blindingly obvious that the deal would be scrutinised. With nearly the whole of the French and Italian markets, how could it not be?"

Frances Murphy, head of European competition at Rowe and Maw, a City of London law firm, says: "Like him or hate him, Monti is robust about opening up national markets to competition within the EU. He has the skin of a rhino. He will not act for what is in the best interests of one national market. If a deal is not in the best interests of a market across the board he will block it."

One managing director at an Anglo-French bank says: "The closed club of French business has shot itself in the foot. How long before the French authorities take a lead from the UK Takeover Panel, which allows an offer to be subject to anti-trust clearance?"

RESEARCH ALERT - JP Morgan adjusts  Schneider  EPS.

(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
PARIS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - JP Morgan on Tuesday made mixed changes in its earnings estimates for Schneider Electric and set a new target price of 50 euros for the electrical equipment firm, whose acquisition of Legrand fell foul of the  European Commission last week.

The investment bank said it was increasing  Schneider's  EPS forecast by 5.5 percent in 2001 to 3.27 euros but decreasing it by 11.6 percent to 3.36 euros in 2002 to reflect "the new form of ownership, the absence of merger costs in 2001 but also the absence of synergies thereafter".
JP Morgan said it was dropping its Schneider-Legrand consolidated model for a Schneider model in which
Legrand is accounted for as a financial investment of 5.4 billion euros.

Schneider remained JP Morgan's top pick in the sector but concern over the U.S. construction outlook led the investment firm to keep a "market performer" rating on Schneider.

The European Commission last week blocked Schneider's 7.2 billion euro takeover of Legrand on anti-trust grounds.

Schneider  Electric's Day Of Reckoning Arrives
By Greg Keller

PARIS -(Dow Jones)-  Schneider  Electric SA's (F.SCN) management faces its day of reckoning Friday when its board of directors meets for the first time since the dramatic collapse of its merger with French rival  Legrand SA (F.LGR).

Managers at Schneider,  an electrical equipment maker, have refused to comment publicly since the Oct. 10 decision by the European Commission to block its EUR7.2 billion merger with  Legrand. Friday, management will have no way to escape its responsibility to explain what went wrong, what it plans to do next, and possibly, who is to take the fall for what one analyst called "a massive destruction of shareholder value."

Investors have wiped EUR1.5 billion off Schneider's market capitalization since Sept. 27, when the company for the first time warned it expected a negative opinion from the E.U.'s merger task force. For months leading up to that date, Schneider Chief Executive Henri Lachmann insisted at every turn that the merger would face no significant opposition from the E.U.

But Oct. 10, the E.U. ruled the merged group's market share in France, Italy, Spain and Denmark would be too great
The board meeting is scheduled for midday Friday, a source close to the company said.

Analysts see two ways out for Schneider now that the E.U. decision leaves it no choice but to unwind its acquisition of Legrand, in which the group took a 98% stake following a successful cash and shares offer completed in August.

Either it spins off Legrand, issuing existing shareholders with one Legrand share for every Schneider share held, or it tries to make a trade sale of all or part of Legrand. Names such as General Electric Co. (GE), Tyco International Ltd. (TYC) and Siemens AG (SI) have been mentioned as being potential buyers.

A spinoff is seen as most likely, as it would be the most favorable outcome for Legrand's founding Decoster and Verspieren families, who traded their 40% share in Legrand for a 12% stake in Schneider, becoming its biggest shareholders. Were Schneider to sell Legrand, it would need to use the proceeds for a massive share buyback, which would have nasty tax implications for Legrand's shareholders, said Societe Generale analyst Fabrice Theveneau.

But beyond the mechanics of how Schneider is going to get itself out of this mess, some analysts and fund managers are asking who, if anyone, at Schneider is going to take the fall for this fiasco.

"We're going to raise that question" said one Dutch fund manager who says he "bailed out" of Schneider stock when it became clear that upside from the merger's promised synergies was not to be had.

An analyst at a large French bank summed up his expectations of Friday's meeting this way: "Worst case, Lachmann gets sacked. Best case, there is no best case. He's 100% responsible" for the merger's failure, he said.
Besides Lachmann and Vice Chief Executive Jean-Paul Jacamon, Schneider's board of directors includes
ex-chief executive Didier Pineau-Valencienne, Claude Bebear, chief executive of insurance giant Axa SA (AXA),
Daniel Bouton, chief executive of banking group Societe Generale (F.SGF), Thierry Breton, chief executive of
consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMS), Jean-Rene Fourtou, vice chief executive of

pharmaceutical group Aventis SA (AVE), Michel Francois-Poncet, vice chief executive of banking group BNP Paribas SA (F.BNP), Gerard de La Martiniere, financial director of Axa, and five others.

FRANCE'S SCHNEIDER SEES GROWTH IN POLISH ELECTRICAL-EQUIPMENT MARKET, EYES POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS.

French electrical equipment supplier  Schneider  sees its Polish units boosting turnover by 10% in 2002 from the planned PLN 205 mln in 2001 and may be considering acquisitions in Poland, a top company official told Interfax after a Friday press conference. "We forecast significant 10% turnover growth in Poland next year despite a difficult market, and we aim for more than 10% growth in the subsequent few years," said Rune A. Johansson, Schneider  Electric vice-president in charge of Central and Eastern  Europe and Asia.  Schneider  reps, however, would not discuss at the Friday press conference the value of planned investments in Poland, though they did point out that since the company was refused  European antitrust consent to merge with  Legrand, another French electrical equipment group, acquisition possibilities in Poland had thus increased.

The European Commission blocked Schneider's acquisition of its French rival on anti-competition concerns, but after the two companies had already merged. Schneider is considering appealing the decision or ways of withdrawing from the investment. Schneider, which mainly supplies industry, plans next year to develop its Bukowno electrical equipment factory in Poland, investing EUR 2.5 mln in new buildings and PLN 5 mln-6 mln in production lines. The French have already invested PLN 30 mln in the factory. Schneider, besides Schneider Polska, holds 4 companies in Poland including Elda and Eltra bought from Sweden's Lexel in 1999. The two companies account for as much as three-quarters of Schneider's total Polish turnover. Schneider Polska employs
1,500 people and recorded turnover of PLN 190 mln last year. The Schneider Electric Group, with annual turnover of PLN 10 bln, operates in 130 countries, employing 72,000 people.

Schneider  mulls Legrand exit but to appeal EU veto.

PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - France's  Schneider  Electric SA said on Friday it was considering ways of divesting from peer Legrand but would still appeal against the  European Commission's veto of their planned merger.

Schneider,  which owns 98 percent of  Legrand, said it would either sell it or spin off by distributing  Legrand
shares to Schneider  Electric shareholders.

"The board of directors will choose the solution which will allow it, under the terms imposed by the Commission, to maximise the interests of shareholders and assure the survival of the companies," it said in a statement after a board meeting.

With European stock markets wallowing near three-year lows, analysts say Legrand could fetch much less than the 7.2 billion euros including debt that Schneider paid originally.

The Commission, which blocked the merger last week on anti-trust grounds, has said it is "prepared to examine the practical arrangments for restoring effective competition", indicating it may allot Schneider some time to prepare an organised sale.

Schneider confirmed it would appeal to the European Union Tribunal to overturn the Commission's veto, a move analysts and lawyers have said would have virtually no chance of success.

The company also said Jean-Paul Jacamon's post of deputy chairman had been scrapped and he had therefore resigned.
He remains adviser to Chairman Henri Lachmann. Document lba0000020011019dxaj03tta

Schneider  Electric  Shares Fall After Management Shake-Up

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Shares in French electrical equipment maker  Schneider  Electric SA (F.SCN) fell Friday after the company unveiled a management shake-up that analysts said failed to lay blame properly for the company's failed merger with French rival  Legrand SA (F.LGR).

Schneider's  board, meeting for the first time since the Oct. 10  European Union Commission ruling which blocked Schneider's  acquisition of  Legrand, said it would eliminate the position of vice chief executive. Jean-Paul Jacamon, Schneider's  current vice chief executive, resigned, as did former CEO and member of the board of directors, Didier Pineau-Valencienne.
Analysts said the company was wrong to force out Jacamon, a 20-year veteran of the company.

"They got the wrong guy," one London-based analyst said. "People tended to like Jacamon. He didn't deserve this."
Another Paris-based analyst agreed.

"The sacking of Jean-Paul Jacamon is really surprising when we know that he was much less involved than other key guys within the process of linking up with Legrand, so (he could only) with difficulty be considered as responsible for anything," he said.

The analyst said Jacamon's departure is "very bad news for Schneider" as he was "much appreciated by the market for his truthful and transparent way of speaking with the financial community."

Jacamon will stay on as an advisor to CEO Henri Lachmann, whom analysts said should have been the board's target.

"He was the key driver" of the failed merger, the London-based analyst said, attributing Jacamon's fall to "a power struggle."

He also derided the Schneider board's statement that the group still has a strategy that will "allow it to continue its development as a major global actor."
"What strategy? They still have no strategy," he said.
Since unveiling the deal last January, the merger has been the foundation of Schneider's growth strategy. Analysts say the failed merger may make Schneider the target of larger foreign rivals such as General Electric
Co. (GE) or Siemens AG (G.SIE).

Investors agreed, sending Schneider's stock to a low of EUR39.41 on news of the shake-up. The stock closed down EUR2.48, or 5.6%, at EUR41.51.

Schneider  Electric Polska (SEP) plans to increase its turnover value from ZL175m in 2000 to ZL205 this year. The company's management also plans new investments and, maybe, a take-over of Polish companies. This is directly connected with the failure of a merger with French company  Legrand, where the take-over was blocked by the European Commission. "After the sale of  Legrand's shares, the number of new take-overs will rise rapidly. It is too early to release concrete information, yet it is obvious we are interested in these areas where we can increase our market share - for instance companies providing solutions for the Internet" said  Schneider's

After Schneider,  EU Turns Spotlight On Usinor Tie-Up
By Andrea Barsony

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Just a couple of weeks after throwing out the EUR8 billion merger between  Schneider  SA (F.SCN) and  Legrand SA (F.LGR), the  European Union Commission is putting another big French merger under the microscope.

Market watchers say steelmaker Usinor SA's (F.USN) EUR30 billion merger plan to merge with  European rivals Aceralia Corporacion Siderurgica SA (E.ACS) and Arbed SA (L.ARB) should get the E.U.'s nod, but not without asset sales that might be sizable enough to jeopardize the business logic of the deal.
"It's not a foregone conclusion," said London-based Commerzbank analyst Peter Dupont.

"If they had to dispose of major integrated complexes, it would ruin the economics of the deal. It would just mean they would be losing too much volume and their customer base."

The Commission has told Usinor it must reduce its share of Europe's market for flat steels if it wants approval for the three-way tie-up.

In a list of concerns forwarded to the three steelmakers, industry sources said the Commission also highlighted competition worries over the groups' distribution units in France and Spain.

Along with its two merger partners, Usinor is currently drafting a list of proposed divestments in an effort to head off the Commission's concerns. According to industry sources, Usinor may also be planning to sell its Eko-Stahl AG unit in Germany to secure the Commission's support for the "Newco" project.

"The steel industry has nothing in common with Schneider-Legrand," said an advisor to the merger who declined to be named.

"Steel producers are trading at a 40% discount from their equity. We're not creating a steel cartel, not establishing any bargaining power."

Earlier this month, the Commission threw out the Schneider-Legrand merger because it thought the group would have an overly dominant a position in several key European markets, including France and Italy.

To win the Commission's backing for their deal, Usinor and its two partners must do something to address their dominance of the market for galvanized steel, a form of flat product vital to the car industry.

Union sources said Commission officials have faced intense lobbying from Europe's car makers, who are also worried about the new company's prospective dominance in that segment of the market.
As it stands, the newly-merged group - provisionally dubbed Newco - would control between 40% and 45% of the
European market. Thirty-five percent is usually enough to set the alarms bells ringing in Brussels.

Analysts believe Newco can get away with some asset sales without necessarily jeopardizing the logic of the deal.

However, executives currently working on a proposal for asset sales to submit to Brussels later this month won't want to cut too deep.

According to Ken Hughes, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais, simply getting Newco's share of the galvanized market down to 35% would mean selling off seven plants.

Commerzbank's Dupont, meanwhile, identifies a number of divestments that would undermine the deal, including at least four plants in France and Belgium and Aceralia's flat products division in Spain.

Newco would certainly be a big project for the Commission to tackle. The three-way merger would create the world's biggest steel company, capable of producing around 40 million metric tons of crude steel a year and about three times bigger than its nearest competitors - Germany's ThyssenKrupp AG (G.TKP) and the Anglo-Dutch producer Corus Group PLC (CGA).

The Commission, under Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, seems to have the bit between its teeth. In recent weeks, Brussels has courted controversy by blocking both Schneider-Legrand and the proposed merger between General Electric Co. (GE) and Honeywell International Inc. (HON).

More relevant to Usinor's plans, though, is last year's three-way tie-up between aluminum producer Alcan Inc. (AL), Alusuisse AG and Pechiney SA (PY) which failed after the Commission insisted the companies sell off key assets in Europe to comply with antitrust rules.

There are, however, two factors which would ease the sting for the steel producers. Firstly, Usinor's planned merger has been made conditional on approval from Brussels. That means the French group should at least be able to avoid the financial headaches currently besieging the failed Schneider-Legrand tie-up, which was consummated before receiving approval.

Secondly, whatever assets Newco has to put up for sale, it should find willing buyers. The value of assets in the sector have dipped sharply, along with world prices for steel.
"It's a good time to pick up assets," said John Johnson, an analyst for commodity specialists CRU International in
London.

"Consolidation has to occur - to lift prices, reduce costs and get rid of excess capacity. It's part of the recovery process."

Usinor, Arbed, Aceralia finalise  disposal proposals to gain Brussels' approval.

The European Commission has until November 23 to give its decision on the merger of  European steel groups
Usinor, Aceralia and Arbed, although it could give its decision earlier.

The merger looks likely to get the go ahead, as, according to an informed source yesterday, the steel groups have suggested divestments in line with Brussels' demands. This was not the case with  Schneider Legrand, as both companies were slow to offer solutions to the problem areas identified by the Commission.

The group resulting from the merger, temporarily named "Newco", would have a production capacity of 45m tonnes. Brussels has identified two problem areas: the market share Newco will have in steels destined for the car markets and Newco's distribution services. Usinor has proposed selling its cold rolling mill at Strasbourg (belonging to Sollac Lorraine), and its Botor unit in the Paris area. The Lusosider factory in Portugal and Galmed in Spain, both of which supply to the car industry, may also have to be disposed of. Other sacrifices may also have to be made in order to gain Brussels' approval. Credible buyers with the means to provide competition will need to be found.
The three steel groups have until midnight tonight to submit their disposal proposals to Brussels. [Original article approx 400 words]

Schneider  to seek damages over Legrand veto.

PARIS, Oct 29 (Reuters) -  Schneider  Electric SA is pressing ahead with a plan to seek compensation after the European Commission vetoed the French company's acquisition of peer  Legrand SA ,  Schneider  Chairman Henri Lachmann said.

"We have been mistreated too much," Lachmann told newspaper Le Monde in an interview published on Monday. "The procedure is opaque and tantamount to a denial of justice...If it is recognized that we have been mistreated, we could obtain damages."

On October 10, the Commission scuppered Schneider's acquisition of Legrand on concern the new company would smother competition in the French and Italian markets.

The decision was a blow for Schneider, which has already mopped up 98 percent of Legrand's shares and will now probably have to sell them at what analysts say is likely to be a massive discount.
After Brussels' decision was announced, Schneider said it would probably lodge an appeal with the European
Court of Justice in Luxembourg, though analysts and lawyers said its chances of success were slim.
For the moment, the EU has not fixed a date by which Schneider must sell its Legrand shares, Lachmann said. "We don't want to adopt a solution which would lead to a substantial loss or which would impoverish the two
companies," Lachmann said. "We would like the maximum amount of time and flexibility to carry out our
separation in the best conditions."

Schneider's strategy would not change as a result of the setback and the company would continue to expand in the low voltage, factory automation and building control equipment businesses, he added.

Schneider: No Need For New Strategy Post-Legrand -Report

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Commission's decision to block  Schneider  Electric SA's (F.SCN) merger with Legrand SA (F.LGR) won't force the French electrical equipment maker to change strategies,  Schneider's chief executive said in an interview in Le Monde published Monday.

"We are following the same strategy," Henri Lachmann said. "The merger with  Legrand wasn't an end, but a means to accelerate our development...We will continue to develop our low voltage and industrial automation and control activities," Lachmann said.
He said income from the eventual sale of Legrand could provide "significant finances" to fund this development. Lachmann also said he would carry out his threat to appeal the E.U. decision to block the merger, "not to get back
Legrand, but to obtain compensation.
"We were badly wronged...If the court finds in our favor, we will obtain damages and interest," Lachmann said. Lachmann said he has met E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti one time since the merger was blocked
earlier this month, and that Monti made clear that Schneider "mustn't retain a significant stake in Legrand, for
example to keep 20% alongside an otherwise fragmented capital structure."

Lachmann said the E.U. hasn't yet set a timetable for Schneider to dispose of its stake in Legrand, and added that if the timeframe is too strict, "it will be possible to get the order suspended."

Lachmann also said that while he accepts responsibility for the merger's failure, he would not resign, as did Schneider's Vice-CEO Jean-Paul Jacamon and Didier Pineau-Valancienne, Schneider's ex-CEO and a member of its board of directors.
"In my eyes, to quit would be to abandon my responsibilities," Lachmann said.

Lachmann accused German rival Siemens (SI) of helping to sabatoge the merger by its "destructive attitude" toward the project.
Lachmann denied that arrogance played a part in the merger's unraveling.

"There was never any arrogance on our part," Lachmann said. "We responded to all the questions posed to us, mobilized dozens of people within the company for six months, turned over more than 1 million documents on our markets and products."
Lachmann also denied being behind the decision of French President Jacques Chirac and Finance Minister
Laurent Fabius to lobby Brussels on Schneider's behalf.
"I didn't ask anyone to intervene. But I can't stop them from doing it," Lachmann said. Newspaper Web site:  http://www.lemonde.fr

Schneider  wants maximum  time for Legrand separation.

French electrical equipment group  Schneider  wants "the maximum amount of time and flexibility" to bring about its separation from peer Legrand in the "best conditions" after their merger was vetoed by the  European Commission, Schneider  chairman Henri Lachmann says in an interview in Le Monde.
He says the Commission has not yet set any deadlines for their separation.

Schneider wants to find a solution that will ensure the "future of both groups" and is in the interest of shareholders. Schneider owns 98% of Legrand.
Lachmann confirmed the group was planning legal action to obtain compensation.

Lachmann stresses the decision to block the merger will not affect Schneider's strategy. "The merger with Legrand was not an end, but a means to speed up our development." The group will continue to develop and the sale of Legrand "could even bring us significant additional resources". The group will have the desire and means to pursue an "ambitious growth" strategy.

European court blocks  Schneider's proposed purchase  of Legrand

Schneider  Electric SA's proposed acquisition of  Legrand has been blocked by the  European Union
Commission.
Commission officials ruled against the merger, which would have created one of the largest electrical companies
in the world, because of concerns that the newly merged Schneider  Legrand would have too dominant a position
in the French and Italian markets and particularly for circuit breakers. Schneider  is appealing the decision.

The proposed acquisition of Legrand by Schneider SA would have created one of the largest electrical companies in North America and the first to offer a basket of products that would have included wiring devices, lighting controls, circuit breakers, load centers, voice/data products and industrial automation equipment.

Schneider Electric SA is best known in North America through its Square D, Telemecanique, Merlin Gerin and MGE UPS subsidiaries, and its leading positions in many areas of the distribution equipment market and in some parts of the industrial controls market.

Legrand has made a name for itself in North America with its acquisitions of Pass & Seymour, Wiremold, The Watt Stopper, Ortronics, Slater Electric, Caribe GE Wiring Devices, Power Controls Corp., Sierra Electric, Reiker Enterprises and Tomstar Controls.
Schneider Electric said it would appeal the decision to the Court of First Instance of the European Communities in
Luxembourg to ensure that all of its rights are recognized.

Global markets - Europe - Schneider  looks to make Legrand exit.

Electrical giant  Schneider  wants compensation after its proposed merger with rival electrical equipment company
Legrand was vetoed by the  European Union, writes Meera Selva.

If there ever were two star-crossed lovers in the world of electrical engineering, then  Schneider  and Legrand certainly fit the bill. All year, they have struggled to merge, in the face of hostility from their shareholders, and from regulators.

In May, Legrand's preference shareholders took legal action to stop the original deal going through, as they felt they had been unfairly treated, which forced Schneider to irritate its own shareholders with an increased offer for Legrand.

Earlier this month however, the European Commission dealt what seems to be the deathblow to the deal when it said the merged entity would kill off competition in the French and Italian electricity markets.

For Schneider, the verdict was a disaster. It had already bought 98% of Legrands shares and if the merger is blocked, it will have to sell them back on the market at a heavy discount.
To make matters worse, the European Commission can set a deadline for the disposal of the shares, so
Schneider will not even be able to time its exit.

Investors are now utterly fed up of the high drama of the situation. Jean-Marc Fraysse, manager of the 384 million Cazenove European Acc Ret fund, was hit hard by the decision, which he refers to as a corporate disaster linked to so called defensives, and other investors wonder why anyone should trust these companies again.

Schneider has no way out of this mess, as its offer for Legrand is unconditional, and it cannot now simply reverse the transaction and take its money back.

So it will have to find a buyer for the entire Legrand business, and buyers are scare at the moment. It could float the Legrand business on the stockmarket but it may now find it hard to persuade potential shareholders it can do this competently.

Little wonder then that it feels legal action to claim compensation is its only option. In reality though its chances of winning the legal battle are slim, and will only serve to prolong this fiasco for another few months, and drive away the handful of investors that remain.

FRANCE'S SCHNEIDER SEES GROWTH IN POLISH ELECTRICAL-EQUIPMENT MARKET, EYES POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS.

Interfax Poland Weekly Business Report

(c) 2001 by Interfax International, Ltd
French electrical equipment supplier  Schneider  sees its Polish units boosting turnover by 10% in 2002 from the planned PLN 205 mln in 2001 and may be considering acquisitions in Poland, a top company official told Interfax after a Friday press conference. "We forecast significant 10% turnover growth in Poland next year despite a difficult market, and we aim for more than 10% growth in the subsequent few years," said Rune A. Johansson, Schneider  Electric vice-president in charge of Central and Eastern  Europe and Asia.  Schneider  reps, however, would not discuss at the Friday press conference the value of planned investments in Poland, though they did point out that since the company was refused  European antitrust consent to merge with  Legrand, another French electrical equipment group, acquisition possibilities in Poland had thus increased.

The European Commission blocked Schneider's acquisition of its French rival on anti-competition concerns, but after the two companies had already merged. Schneider is considering appealing the decision or ways of withdrawing from the investment. Schneider, which mainly supplies industry, plans next year to develop its Bukowno electrical equipment factory in Poland, investing EUR 2.5 mln in new buildings and PLN 5 mln-6 mln in production lines. The French have already invested PLN 30 mln in the factory. Schneider, besides Schneider Polska, holds 4 companies in Poland including Elda and Eltra bought from Sweden's Lexel in 1999. The two companies account for as much as three-quarters of Schneider's total Polish turnover. Schneider Polska employs
1,500 people and recorded turnover of PLN 190 mln last year. The Schneider Electric Group, with annual turnover of PLN 10 bln, operates in 130 countries, employing 72,000 people.
