LISBON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The European Commission's talks with Energias de Portugal (EDP) (EDPP.IN) and Italy's  ENI (ENI.MI) on their plans to buy gas assets from Galpenergia are "very difficult", the head of Portugal's anti-trust body said on Friday.
The EC last month sent a formal statement of objections to  EDP and ENI over their plans to buy 51 percent and
49 percent, respectively, of  Gas de Portugal from Portugal's state energy company.

The negotiations with the EC's anti-trust officials "are very difficult. I can't say anything more," Abel Mateus, chief executive of Portugal's Competition Authority, told reporters at a judicial workshop on anti-trust law.

LISBON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The European Commission's talks with Energias de Portugal (EDP) (EDPP.IN) and Italy's  ENI (ENI.MI) on their plans to buy gas assets from Galpenergia are "very difficult", the head of Portugal's antitrust body said on Friday.

"I can't say anything more," Abel Mateus, chairman of Portugal's Competition Authority, told reporters at a judicial workshop on antitrust law.
The EC last month sent a formal statement of objections to EDP and ENI over their plans to buy 51 percent and
49 percent, respectively, of Gas de Portugal from Portugal's state energy company.

The European Commission has said it will conclude its investigation into the matter by December 15 "after all the competition authorities of the member states had been consulted," he said.
All of the authorities will be watching the resolution closely, especially France and Spain, Mateus added.

The restructuring of Portugal's energy sector comes as Portugal and Spain prepare to launch next year an Iberian power market.
The Competition Authority also is investigating Portuguese national electricity grid REN's planned acquisition of
Transgas from Galpenergia.

EDP Chief Financial Officer Rui Horta e Costa said in an interview a week ago that EDP will not allow the EC to break the company as a result of the proposed Gas de Portugal acquisition.


Shares of EDP were trading at 2.33, down 0.85 percent, at 1138 GMT. The benchmark PSI20 index  was down 0.22 percent and the DJ Stoxx utility suppliers index         was down 0.5 percent.

Portugal's EDP open to compromise with EU on electricity-gas merger

LISBON, Nov 13 (AFP) -

Portuguese power firm EDP is willing to compromise in order to overcome  European Commission objections to a proposed merger with Gas de Portugal (GdP), the president of the utility said in an interview published Saturday.
State-controlled oil company Galp Energia is proposing to sell 51 percent of GdP to former state monopoly EDP
and the other 49 percent to Italian energy group ENI.

But last month the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, formally objected to the proposed merger, expressing concern to Lisbon that the deal could make Portugal's main electricity and gas providers overwhelmingly dominant.

EDP president Joao Talone told weekly newspaper Expresso the company was willing to temporarily give up its veto right in Portuguese gas company Turbogas, a smaller rival of GdP, in order to remove these concerns.
The utility currently has a 20 percent stake in Turbogas which gives it a veto right over key decisions. While Talone said EDP would be willing to give up the veto rights, he ruled out selling the firm's stake in
Turbogas.

Talone added EDP was also willing to sell its terminal in Sines south of Lisbon in order to win approval for the merger.
"We are very close to reaching a consensus," he said.

Portugal and Spain agreed at a summit earlier this year to start running a long-delayed unified power market before June 2005, known as Mibel, and Lisbon is eager to get approval for the merger before that then.

Talone echoed the view of the Portuguese government which argues that the EDP-GdP deal should be considered in the context of the proposed Mibel single Iberian energy market instead of just in the context of the Portuguese market.

EC, EDP close to consensus on gas deal - EDP CEO.

(c) 2004 Reuters Limited
LISBON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Energias de Portugal (EDP) (EDPP.IN) and the European Commission are "very close to a consensus" on  EDP's plans to buy  gas assets from Galpenergia, EDP Chief Executive Joao Talone said in an interview with Portuguese newspaper Expresso published on Saturday.
The EC is scrutinizing EDP's plan to buy 51 percent of Gas de Portugal from Portugal's state energy company
Galpenergia, as well as a proposal from Italy's  ENI (ENI.MI) to buy the remaining 49 percent.

The EC sent a formal statement of objections to the energy companies last month and has said it will conclude its investigation by December 15.

Talone said he would consider lobbying the EC hard for approval similar to efforts made by French Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, who pushed through a rescue of engineering firm Alstom that prevented Germany's Siemens from acquiring a stake.

"I am not a minister (like Sarkozy), but I also can camp out in Brussels and summon the television stations," he told Expresso.
"But that will not be necessary," Talone said. "We are very close to a consensus."
As for possible concessions to win approval, Talone said the most obvious would be suspending EDP's (voting)
rights in Portuguese independent power producer Turbogas, but EDP would not want to sell off Turbogas.

EDP owns 20 percent of Turbogas, which owns a combined-cycle gas-fired power station in Portugal. EDP has signed a so-called "call option" agreement that gives it the option to buy another 20 percent.

Meanwhile, the Portuguese government has a backup plan in case the EC rejects Portugal's energy industry restructuring, said Economic Affairs Minister Alvaro Barreto.

"We have alternatives that can be rapidly implemented," Barreto was quoted as saying in an article in Publico newspaper on Saturday. He declined to elaborate.
The energy restructuring is being done in advance of the 2005 launch of an Iberian energy market with Spain. Document LBA0000020041113e0bd0073n

LISBON (Dow Jones)--The European Commission, in its report on Energias de Portugal's (EDP) plan to integrate natural  gas producer Gas de Portugal's assets, says the proposed unified Iberian electricity market, or MIBEL, is hampered by lack of interconnectivity between Spain and Portugal, Diario Economico reports.

Citing a copy of the  Commission report, the paper notes projects to increase the connection capacity between the two countries are running behind schedule.

EDP, Brussels in 11th-hour  talks over Galp gas.

LISBON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Energias de Portugal and Brussels are in 11th-hour talks to resolve antitrust issues over EDP's purchase of natural  gas assets from energy company Galpenergia, a source close to the process said on Thursday.

EDP and the European Commission are seeking remedies to ease Brussels objections to the closely watched deal. It involves splitting off 1.2 billion euros in natural gas assets from state-controlled Galpenergia.
"The talks seem to be well under way," the source said.

"There is a final effort for talks to be concluded in the next few days, today, tomorrow, so that this matter does not have to be taken up by the next Commission."

The new Commission executive headed by former Portuguese prime minister Jose Manuel Barroso takes office on Monday.

EDP, Portugal's biggest industrial group, and Italian energy group ENI are buying 51 percent and 49 percent, respectively, of Gas de Portugal from Galpenergia.

Portugal is restructuring EDP and the rest of its energy sector to face increased competition with the launch of a single Iberian power market next year.

The Commission sent a list of objections to EDP and ENI last month about the purchase. Portuguese authorities have said anti-trust agencies in the 25 European Union countries are watching the case closely, especially Spain and France.

EDP is balking at a Commission suggestion that it give up contracts for the importation of 6.5 billion cubic metres of natural gas, the source close to the process said.
The Commission wants the contracts to go to Transgas, the state natural gas network.

The Commission also objects to EDP's stakes in two Portuguese power plants, Turbogas and Tejo Energia, the source said. EDP has minority holdings in the two, but has veto rights over strategic decisions.
The Commission wants EDP to give up its veto rights. EDP wants to give them up only until the start of the single
Iberian market.

The Commission also is proposing that EDP give up its oil terminal at Sines, a port about 100 km (60 miles) south of Lisbon. EDP is willing to give in but points out it could buy a terminal or be partners in one in Spain, the source said.

The source said EDP wanted solutions only until the start of the single power market, when increased liberalisation will remove anti-trust objections.

The source said the recommendation would be sent to the  European Competition Commissioner.

EDP and the Commission are in talks over the deal which involves splitting off 1.2 billion euros ($1.57 billion) in natural gas assets from state-controlled Galpenergia.

UPDATE 3-EU staff recommends blocking Portugal  gas deal.

Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 2004 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS/LISBON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - European Commission staff recommended on Thursday that Energias de Portugal and  ENI be barred from buying the natural gas assets of Galpenergia, a source familiar with the matter said.

If Competition Commissioner Mario Monti accepts the recommendation against the merger, as expected later in the day, it will be endorsed by a committee of member states before final approval by the full 25-member European Commission.
The only possibility of saving the deal would be for the parties to offer major new concessions that satisfy
Commission concerns, the source said.

The bar against the merger would likely be the first major competition decision under former Dutch businesswoman Neelie Kroes, who takes over from Monti on Monday.
She is one of 25 members of the new Commission, which won approval earlier in the day in the European
Parliament.

Under European Union rules, the Commission must act to block the deal by December 15 or it is automatically cleared.

EDP, Portugal's biggest industrial group, and Italian energy group ENI proposed buying 51 percent and 49 percent, respectively, of Gas de Portugal from state-controlled Galpenergia for 1.2 billion euros ($1.57 billion).

Portugal is restructuring EDP and the rest of its energy sector to face what is says will be increased competition with the launch of a single Iberian power market scheduled for June next year.

EDP made the case to the Commission that any remedies only had to last only last until the June launch of the new single market, because after that EDP will be in competition with Spanish players, a source in Lisbon said.

But the Commission never bought the story of a single power market. Instead, the Commission saw EDP as the dominant player in Portugal and judged the deal on that basis.

EDP refused to accept a Commission suggestion that it give up contracts for the importation of 6.5 billion cubic metres of natural gas, according to a second source in Lisbon. The contracts were to go to Transgas, the state natural gas network.
The Commission also had concerns about EDP's stakes in two Portuguese power plants, Turbogas and Tejo
Energia. Although they are minority rights, EDP has veto rights over strategic decisions.
The Commission also wanted EDP to give up ownership of an oil terminal at Sines, a port about 100 km south of
Lisbon.
Shares of EDP ended the day 1.3 percent lower at 2.27 euros. Document LBA0000020041118e0bi00ba9

"There is no decision yet. There is not even a proposal," a Commission spokeswoman said. She stopped short of saying the Reuters report was wrong.

The bar against the merger would likely be the first major competition decision under former Dutch businesswoman Neelie Kroes, who takes over from Monti on Monday.
She is one of 25 members of the new Commission, which won approval earlier in the day in the European
Parliament.

Under European Union rules, the Commission must act to block the deal by December 15 or it is automatically cleared.
PORTUGAL RESTRUCTURES POWER

Portugal is restructuring EDP and the rest of its energy sector to face what is says will be increased competition with the launch of a single Iberian power market scheduled for June next year.

EDP made the case to the Commission that any remedies only had to last only last until the June launch of the new single market, because after that EDP will be in competition with Spanish players, a source in Lisbon said.

But the Commission never bought the story of a single power market. Instead, the Commission saw EDP as the dominant player in Portugal and judged the deal on that basis.

EDP refused to accept a Commission suggestion that it give up contracts for the importation of 6.5 billion cubic metres of natural gas, according to a second source in Lisbon. The contracts were to go to Transgas, the state natural gas network.
The Commission also had concerns about EDP's stakes in two Portuguese power plants, Turbogas and Tejo
Energia. Although they are minority rights, EDP has veto rights over strategic decisions.
The Commission also wanted EDP to give up ownership of an oil terminal at Sines, a port about 100 km south of
Lisbon.

LISBON (Dow Jones)--European Union Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is poised to block Energias de Portugal SA's (EDP) plan to absorb natural gas producer Gas de Portugal as part of a broader sector restructuring, Diario Economico reports, citing commission sources in Brussels.
The paper reports the deal could only go forward if there's political intervention from the  Commission, if EDP
makes a major retreat in terms of concessions, or the  European Court of Justices rules on the planned merger.

In Lisbon, EDP said it was "satisfied with the negotiations" with Monti's team and is waiting for the final decision, expected by Dec 8.
EDP's plan, backed by the Portuguese government, is to create a new gas company, with Italy's Eni SpA (E)
taking a 49% stake.

The paper says E.U. regulators are concerned the deal - which would see Energias de Portugal and  Eni take control of  Gas de Portugal - would strengthen the dominant position of  Edp and Gdp in their markets.
If the deal is blocked, it would be the first prohibition of a takeover by the E.U. Commission in three years. Newspaper Web site:  http://www.ft.com

Ener De Portugal: Not Notified  Of Any EU Decision  on GDP

Edited press release.

LISBON (Dow Jones)-Energias de Portugal SA (EDP) said Friday it hasn't been informed of a final decision by the European Commission regarding its plan to merge natural  gas company Gas de Portugal into a new unit, EDP Gas, as part of a broader restructuring of the domestic energy sector.
In the past few weeks contradictory information has been published concerning an hypothetical decision by the
European Commission in relation to the acquisition of joint control over GDP by EDP and Eni SpA (E).

EDP informs that, up to this moment, it has not been notified, nor does it have knowledge of any decision, proposal of decision or recommendation made by the Commission in relation to the abovementioned transaction.

In fact, the proceedings relating to the competition appraisal of such transaction, which involves a confidentiality duty by the notifying parties, is still ongoing, in accordance with the provisions set forth in Council Regulation (EEC) no. 4064/89, of 21 December, on the control of concentrations between undertakings.

Such proceedings were initiated on July 9, 2004 with the filing of the notification of concentration, pursuant to which the Commission adopted, on August 12, a decision to initiate investigation proceedings.

Accordingly, the Commission is analyzing the necessary conditions in order to eliminate the competition law concerns that it had identified in such decision, following the proposals presented by EDP and ENI on Wednesday, November 17, 2004, which were preceded by high level meetings conducted during the previous days.

According to the Regulation, it is necessary for the Commission to consult with the Advisory Committee on concentration between undertakings, which is composed by the Competition Authorities of all Member States.

The Commission's Directorate-General for Competition will present a draft decision that, upon consultation with other Commission services, namely the Legal Service, shall be submitted for appraisal and approval by the EU Commissioners.

The final decision by the Commission on the abovementioned transaction, which is expected to happen by mid-December, will only be taken at that stage. Therefore any news concerning the sense of such decision published before its approval can only be considered as speculative.

Portugal  Eyes Options  After EU "Blocks" EDP Plans

19 November 2004

Dow Jones International News

(c) 2004 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
LISBON (Dow Jones)--The Portuguese government said Friday it is studying three plans to restructure the energy sector after being informally told that the  European Union Commission is set to block its initial idea of merging natural gas company GDP into Energias de Portugal SA (EDP).

Meanwhile, EDP put out a statement late Friday saying it hadn't been officially informed of any decision on the GDP merger plan. It said it considers the process still underway and said a final decision isn't expected until mid-December.

Portuguese Economy Minister Alvaro Barreto, who spoke at a luncheon, did not provide specifics of the three alternative plans his government is considering. He said he hoped an alternative plan would be ready by early
2005.
The original plan had seen GDP sold to EDP by energy company Galpenergia (GAP.YY). Italian company Eni
SpA (E) would take a 49% stake in a new unit, EDP Gas, to manage the natural gas operations.

E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti has reportedly been concerned with the dominant position in the electricity generation and natural gas distribution market that EDP would have if the plan went through. The commission had suggested a variety of concessions that would make approval of the plan more likely, including the divestment of generation assets.

EDP and the Portuguese government argued that the Portuguese market should be considered in the Iberian context, given the efforts underway to create a single unified market for electricity in Spain and Portugal. While EDP is Portugal's largest electricity company, it is in the middle of the ranking in Spain through its Hidrocantabrico unit.

Earlier Friday, Banoc BPI said it expected EDP shares to remain volatile until the restructuring plan's fate is definitely settled. EDP shares have bounced around in recent weeks in part because of the questions hanging over the natural gas merger, but mainly because the company is in the middle of a EUR1.2 billion rights issue to help fund its acquisition of Hidrocantabrico.

Also Friday, Spanish generator Iberdrola SA (IBE.MC) said it would subscribe to the rights issue, maintaining its stake at 5% in EDP, with an investment of EUR61 million. EDP shareholders Banco Comercial Portugues (BCPAM.LB) and highway operator Brisa SA (BRIAM.LB) have both also said they will subscribe to the rights issue.
EDP shares closed down EUR0.02 at EUR2.25.

LISBON, Nov 19 (Reuters) -  European Commission staff have rejected Energias de Portugal's (EDP) (EDPP.IN) plan to buy gas assets from state-controlled Galpenergia, Alvaro Barreto, economic affairs minister of Portugal, said on Friday.

EC Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told Barreto he agrees with the staff recommendation, Barreto said at a lunchtime debate at the Portuguese Energy Association.
EDP and Italian energy group ENI (ENI.MI) have proposed buying 51 percent and 49 percent, respectively, of
Gas de Portugal from Galpenergia for 1.2 billion euros ($1.57 billion).
"There is a proposal by the EC staff to reject authorising this plan," he said. "I don't know the reasons." "This process does not end here; we have various alternatives," Barreto added. Portugal "will try to have a
restructuring that permits it to have a Portuguese partner with the ability to compete" in the common Iberian
power market to be launched next June with Spain.

Late on Friday EDP said that the commission is willing to review the points in dispute with EDP and ENI next week. EDP also said it would not accept any requirements that would put the value of its electrical business in jeopardy, adding it was still open for "transitory" measures to resolve the disputed points.

EDP said it will "make an effort next week for a final joint revision of the issues that are still open," EDP said in a statement.
Portugal is restructuring EDP and the rest of its energy sector in anticipation of the Iberian power market.
A meeting on the EC decision on the merger is scheduled for Nov. 26 for the competition authorities of the 25
European Union member states, Abel Mateus, chairman of Portugal's Competition Authority, said on Thursday.
Portugal officials will study the EC staff decision and talk with executives at EDP and ENI, Barreto said.

Portugal officials, meanwhile, are studying three different alternatives for restructuring the energy sector, Barreto told reporters after the debate.
Portugal aims to liberalise its gas sector before 2011. Shares of EDP closed at 2.25 euros, down 0.88 percent.


The benchmark PSI20 index  was up 0.22 percent and the DJ Stoxx utility suppliers index         was down 0.42 percent.

The decision, which reflects  Commission recommendations, is a setback for Energias and  ENI, the Italian energy group, which proposed buying 51 per cent and 49 per cent respectively, of  Gas de Portugal from Galpenergia for  Euro 1.2 billion (Pounds 841 million). Portugal is restructuring its energy sector.

EDP’s EUR 1.2bn rights  issue in confusion after Brussels rejects merger

THE EUR 1.2 billion (£0.84 billion) share issue by Energias de Portugal (EDP) was thrown into confusion on Monday when European Commission officials came out against the group’s merger with  Gas de Portugal a few days before the issue closes on Friday. The Competition  Commission and the Portuguese government have been unable to agree on the merger, the outgoing commissioner Mario Monti said. “Portuguese consumers and industrial users already pay amongst the highest electricity prices in the  European Union. This merger would not
have improved the situation unless the right conditions could be agreed,” he said. Monti expects the  Commission
to take the final decision in December, when it will be the responsibility of the new  commission, headed by
former Portuguese prime minister Jose Manuel Barroso. Analysts in Lisbon and Madrid said the  EU’s unexpected
move had left the share issue in a confusing position.

“The Portuguese government has repeated that it expects to reach agreement with Brussels,” said one. “EDP is worth more with the Gas de Portugal assets, but so far it has been valued without them. Everyone is waiting to see if agreement can be reached.” EDP shares remained steady at around EUR 2.25 on Monday. All the new shares are due to be bought by existing shareholders — including Portuguese banks and the local industrial group Brisa, Italian gas group Eni and Spain’s Iberdrola. On Monday, Iberdrola said it would buy shares for EUR
60.7 million in order to maintain its stake at 5%. EDP is issuing shares to raise cash to complete the takeover of

ANALYSIS: MIBEL DOUBTS
EU doubts  EDP's Mibel case
676 words
22 November 2004
Power in Europe
PWRE
1
Number 438
English
(c) 2004 McGraw-Hill, Inc.
A confidential  European Commission document casts doubt on the possibility of creating an effective single Iberian energy market, due to be launched on July 30 next year, citing "important regulatory issues that still have to be agreed upon and harmonised."

The document, a copy of which has been obtained by PiE, is a 116-page "statement of objections" that sets out the Commission's reservations concerning the planned takeover of Portugal's national  gas utility,  Gas de Portugal, by the country's dominant power producer, Energias de Portugal.

EDP's chief argument in support of the proposed merger is that, in view of the planned single Iberian market (Mibel), the deal should be judged by its impact on the Iberian market as a whole, not just on the Portuguese market, where both EDP and GDP are dominant.

EDP argues that the relevant market for electricity wholesale supply will be Iberian in scope in the short term because of the agreements reached between Lisbon and Madrid in January and October this year, calling for the creation of Mibel and the planned increase in interconnection capacity between Portugal and Spain.

However, the EU document states that "on the basis of the in-depth investigation carried out by the Commission, it appears (1) that the relevant market is currently national in scope and (2) it is highly unlikely that, notwithstanding the political agreement reached by the governments of Spain and Portugal, it will become Iberian in scope in the near future."

According to the Commission, several elements show that the effective integra-tion of the Portuguese and Spanish whole-sale electricity markets is "still far from certain and do not permit the assumption of an Iberian market in the short term".

Successive delays and the absence of the necessary national legislation to implement Mibel effectively are due to the fact that "many regulatory issues remain to be addressed in the discussions between the governments, before any effective harmonisation takes place through national legislation within each country".

The Commission says its market investigation clearly confirms that "the regulatory issues that remain to be addressed are far from minimal but, on the contrary, are crucial for the effective implementation of Mibel (…). These issues would still need to be agreed upon and subsequently harmonized by legislation before Mibel can actually start."

Other key issues such as how the grid operators will coordinate and what provisions will apply to regulated suppliers remain unsolved, the Commission says. "It is not yet clear how historic contracts will be properly terminated nor how and according to which timeframe congestion management and interconnection capacity allocation can be agreed upon (counter-trading, market-splitting, etc.)" the report says.
"Many uncertainties therefore remain as to whether and in what form Mibel will actually start on June 30, 2005",
the document states, "and, if so, whether it will prove to be effective enough to lead to an Iberian electricity market
in the foreseeable future."

The Commission also believes that "the projected level of interconnection capacity between Spain and Portugal is not likely to allow effective integration of both markets in the near future". It describes forecasts for improving interconnection capacity as "over-optimistic" and points to the possibility of increased congestion problems.

Page 30 of 117 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The permanent market risk due to frequent congestions can be seen as one of the reasons why Spanish electricity players are contemplating building CCGTs in Portugal," the reports says. It goes on to quote Iberdrola as explaining that "the Portuguese electricity market will remain more or less isolated in the coming years. Hence, Iberdrola needs to be sure it has generation in Portugal, in particular to balance its needs and master its costs of supply."

According to the Commission, the level of congestions in the first months of 2004 was in the range of 25%. "Such a level of congestions is much higher than the levels of congestions observed in the Nordic electricity pool, which are in the range of 0% to 7% of the time," the document adds.

Barcelona (Platts)-22Nov2004/606 am EST/1106 GMT Energias de Portugal and Italy's Eni plan to revise their joint offer to acquire  Gas de Portugal from Portuguese petroleum company Galp Energia, EDP announced late Friday. The move is in response to conditions that the European Commission outlined to EDP last Tuesday and which could scuttle the proposed takeover. "Under no circumstances will EDP accept requirements that might jeopardise the value of its electricity business, which was the main target of the  Commission remedies," the Portuguese utility said in a statement. However,  EDP added it would consider what it called "transitory

Barcelona (Platts)-22Nov2004/610 am EST/1110 GMT The European Commission is expected to issue a formal ruling on the Gas de Portugal takeover next month. Earlier this year, EDP and Eni-affiliate Eni Portugal Investment, together with Portuguese power grid operator Rede Electrica Nacional, reached a deal to purchase
33.34%, 33.33% and 33.33% stakes respectively in GDP for a combined Eur1.2-bil ($1.6-bil). As part of the deal, REN agreed to transfer its GDP interest to EDP and Eni within 12 months of the closing of the acquisition, leaving the Portuguese utility with 51% and the Italian company with 49%. In exchange, REN is to gain exclusive ownership of Portugal's high-pressure natural gas network, valued at Eur738-mil.

Barcelona, Spain (Platts)-22Nov2004/722 am EST/1222 GMT Energias de Portugal and Italy's Eni plan to revise their joint offer to acquire  Gas de Protugal from Portuguese petroleum company Galp Energia, EdP said late Friday. The move is in response to conditions placed on the operation that the European Commission spelled
out to EdP last Tuesday and which could scuttle the proposed takeover. "Under no circumstances will EdP accept requirements that might jeopardise the value of its electricity business, which was the main target of the Commission remedies," the Portuguese utility said in a statement. However,  EdP added it would consider what it called "transitory measures." The  European Commission is expected to issue a formal ruling on the  Gas de Portugal (GdP) operation next month.

Earlier this year, EdP and Eni of Italy affiliate Eni Portugal Investment, together with Portuguese power grid operator Rede Electrica Nacional (REN), reached a deal to purchase 33.34%, 33.33% and 33.33% stakes respectively in GdP for a combined Eur1.2-bil ($1.6-bil).

Barcelona, Spain (Platts)-22Nov2004/724 am EST/1224 GMT As part of the deal, REN agreed to transfer its GdP interest to EdP and Eni within 12 months of the closing of the acquisition, leaving the Portuguese utility with 51% and the Italian company with 49%. In exchange, REN is to gain exclusive ownership of Portugal's high-pressure natural gas network, valued at Eur738-mil.

Portuguese Energy Merger Blocked  by EU

The merger of two  gas and power giants in Portugal has been blocked by the  European Commission due to competition concerns, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The deal would have seen the sale of 51% of  gas firm Gaz de Portugal (GDP), owned by the former state-controlled oil firm Galp Energia, to the former state monopoly Electricidade de Portugal (EDP). The remaining stake would have been sold to  Eni, an Italian energy group. However, according to Economy Minister Álvaro Barreto, the  Commission blocked the sale because it would have passed too much control to the merged company. The government wanted to create a national champion, but the  Commission began an investigation in August 2004 on the grounds that the efforts to restructure the energy sector based on upcoming  European Union (EU) liberalisation measures would stifle market competition.

However, the government and firms called for further consideration, since this would not only affect the Portuguese but also the Spanish markets, as the creation of a joint Iberian market, Mibel, is under way. A similar restructuring move being mulled in France could now be re-thought in light of the decision.

Significance: It had been known that the Commission was lukewarm about the proposal, and the firms involved had attempted to offer compromises to alleviate its fears. Barreto told news agency Lusa that he had advised EDP not to capitulate to Commission demands, however. It is not the first time that the Commission has stepped into a Portuguese merger, and the country has criticised its intervention into national affairs - but with little effect. This is the first such intervention based on grounds of competition for three years, and the merger had the firm backing of the government. As such, the merger is unlikely to be dead in the water.

EDP Not Yet Giving Up on GDP Merger Plans

Portugal's dominant power utility, Electricidade de Portugal (EDP), has said that it has not yet given up on efforts to complete the purchase of a 51% stake in the Portuguese gas utility Gaz de Portugal (GDP). The merger, which would also see Eni acquire a 49% stake in  GDP (currently owned by Galp Energia), is set to be blocked by the European Commission (EC) on the grounds that the merger would be anti-competitive (see Portugal: 19
November 2004: EC Set to Block Portuguese  EDP-GDP Merger on Competition Grounds). EDP has said that while the company is not prepared to sacrifice some of its electricity business interests as the EC has asked, it is prepared to make some concessions in order to allow the deal through. However, with Portugal's Economy Minister Alvaro Baretto stating on 19 November that the  EC would block the deal,  EDP may have little room left for further discussion.

Although EDP stated that it had received no official word on the decision and would continue to try and persuade the EC, there seems to be no time left.

Significance: It now seems highly unlikely that there can be any compromise. The EC increasingly seems to have made its final decision. Baretto appeared to acknowledge this fact by talking of 'alternative' plans to restructure Portugal's energy sector. The Portuguese government has strongly backed the merger, which it believes would create a national champion to compete within a deregulated European energy sector.

(EU) EU/COMPETITION: Commission opposed  to Electricidade de Portugal  and ENI (Italy) buying  out Gas de Portugal

Brussels, 22/11/2004 (Agence  Europe) - Last Friday the competition services submitted a draft decision rejecting the proposal to acquire the Portuguese natural  gas company, Gas de Portugal (GDP) by the traditional electricity provider, Electricidade de Portugal (EDP) and the Italian energy company,  ENI. This decision will be examined by a consultative committee, consisting of representatives from the national competition authorities before the 25
Commissioners meet up in mid-December at the latest. The new College will then have to make a decision by unanimity on this plan, which was launched by José Manuel Barroso. In a final press statement before handing over to Neelie Kroes, Commissioner Monti regretted on Friday that it was "not possible to find a solution to the problems identified by the  Commission".

He explained that "Portuguese consumers and businesses were already paying some of the highest electricity prices in the EU and this merger will not improve the situation, unless appropriate conditions are found". Earlier, the Portuguese minister of the economy, Alvaro Barreto, recognised that reciprocal arrangements proposed by EDP at the opening up of competition did not convince the Commission of the absence of any risk of abuse of dominant position.

According to the project, EDP (whose activities involve electricity production, distribution and supply in Portugal) would have a majority stake and ENI, which operates at all levels of energy supply and distribution would have the other 49%. GDP, which is the traditional gas supplier in Portugal, is currently present at all level of the subsidiary. The Commission began a probe in August and fears that the operation would reinforce EDP's dominant position on the wholesale and integrated Portuguese electricity market, as well as that for GDP in the gas sector. In the context of gas and electricity liberalisation, the operation could lead to the elimination of GDP from the Portuguese electricity markets where it is a competitor to EDP and to EDP's elimination from the wholesale gas supply markets where GDP is dominant. According to the Commission's preliminary examination GDP also provides gas for EDP plants using this electricity to produce electricity and the merger of the two entities could monopolise the Portuguese electricity markets by keeping out electricity companies that wanted to penetrate the gas markets in Portugal. The reciprocal arrangement proposed by EDP in the final negotiations are only spread over a few months leading up to the launch of the single electricity market in June, which the Commission considers insufficient.

EDP MAY COMPROMISE TO PLACATE EU

Energias de Portugal (EdP) said it has not yet received any information from the  European Commission about a possible veto to its controversial takeover of  Gas de Portugal.  EdP released a statement on November 19 to answer "contradictory information" about the proposed takeover of Portugal's incumbent  gas company by EdP
and Italian energy business  ENI. Portuguese and British newspapers have said the  EU plans to block the merger. But EdP insisted that any news issued before the Commission's final decision - due before December 15 - could only be considered speculative. It confirmed that the Commission discussed its concerns with  EdP and ENI officials on November 17. "The  Commission is analysing the necessary conditions in order to eliminate the competition concerns that it had identified", it said.

EdP Chairman João Talone is reported in the local press to have said his company is ready to compromise in response to EU objections to the GdP merger. Public oil company Galp Energia had planned to sell 51% of GdP to EdP, which is 26.1% owned by the Portuguese State. The other 49% is held by Italian group ENI. But last month the Commission said it was concerned about the dominant position that such a merger could lead to within the country, which could prevent other operators from entering the market. To alleviate these fears, EdP says it will temporarily waive its right of veto in Portuguese firm Turbogas, smaller rival of GdP. EdP owns 20% of Turbogas, which gives it a power of veto on all major decisions. However, Mr Talone ruled out giving up his stake in Turbogas. EdP has also said it will sell its import terminal at Sines, 90 km South of Lisbon. It hopes this token
of good will help it gain agreement for the merger from the Commission.

ENERGY: EDP DENIES REPORTS OF EU VETO ON GAS DE PORTUGAL TAKEOVER

Energias de Portugal (EdP) said it has not yet received any information from the  European Commission about a possible veto to its controversial takeover of  Gas de Portugal.  EdP released a statement on November 19 to answer "contradictory information" about the proposed takeover of Portugal's incumbent gas company by EdP

According to reports in the Portuguese press, EdP Chairman João Talone has said his company was prepared to make changes to its takeover plans to allay EU objections to the merger. Originally, the public-owned oil company Galp Energia had planned to sell 51% of GdP to EdP and 49% to ENI. Portugal also owns a 26.1% stake in EdP.

In October, the Commission said it was concerned that the merger would allow the new company to become a dominant player which would prevent other firms from entering the market (see issue 2904). It announced an
in-depth investigation into the tie-up in August (see issue 2891).

To alleviate the EU regulator's fears, EdP has indicated it would temporarily waive its right of veto in Portuguese firm Turbogas, a smaller rival to GdP. EdP owns 20% of Turbogas, which gives it a power of veto on all major decisions. However, Mr Talone ruled out any suggestion that EdP would offload its stake in Turbogas. EdP has also said it would sell its import terminal at Sines, 90 kilometres South of Lisbon - a token of good will it hopes will help it win EU approval for the merger.

NEW OPTIONS FOR ENI-EDP PORTUGUESE GAS ALLIANCE

Energias de Portugal (Edp) and Eni could still carry out the proposed purchase of  gas assets from
state-controlled Galpenergia, despite a preliminary rejection by Brussels (see Sn n° 38, 2004, p. 3), analysts and
an industry source said on Nov. 22.  Edp and Eni might wait until the single Iberian power market with Spain
starts in June 2005 to come up with a solution for state-controlled  Edp and the natural  gas assets, they said.

The European Commission's view on Portugal's closely watched attempt to merge power monopoly  Edp with the natural gas monopoly of Galpenergia is seen as an important precedent for other countries, such as France and Spain.

“Edp is not going to give up the gas business,” Miguel Viana, an analyst with Espirito Santo Research, told “Reuters.” “Some other solutions could be found when Mibel (the Iberian power market) will be in a more advanced state,” he said.

Portuguese economy minister Alvaro Barreto said on Nov. 19 that the European Commission staff had rejected Edp's proposal to buy gas assets from Galpenergia. The commission has until Dec. 15 to make a final decision after hearing antitrust authorities from the 25 EU member nations.

Portugal is splitting off 1.2bn euros in gas assets from Galpenergia as part of an energy sector restructuring with the start of the Iberian power market. Edp and Eni have proposed buying 51% and 49%, respectively, of Gas de Portugal (Gdp), with the final makeup and value of the assets to be defined. Gas transport unit Transgas will go to Ren, the state energy grid.

In case of a final rejection, one option for Edp is to restructure the deal so that it is handled at least initially by Portugal's Antitrust Authority and not Brussels, an industry source close to the process said. The 51% of Gdp could be parked with Parpublica, the state holding company, until the single Iberian power market goes ahead, the source told “Reuters.”

Barreto said that Portugal was studying three alternatives for restructuring the energy sector. He declined to provide details.

BRUSSELS, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The new  European anti-trust chief restated concerns to Energias de Portugal (EDP) on Thursday about the merger of state-controlled natural  gas assets into  EDP, a Commission spokesman said.
Neelie Kroes, who became the  European Commission's competition commissioner on Monday, met  EDP Chief
Executive Joao Talone to discuss the closely watched merger, the spokesman said.

The European Commission's view on Portugal's attempt to merge power company EDP with the natural gas monopoly held by state-controlled Galpenergia is seen as a precedent for other countries, such as Spain and France.

"I can confirm that the president of EDP came to see Neelie Kroes this morning. Neelie Kroes took a firm position and restated very clearly the Commission's concerns," said the Commission spokesman.

Commission staff last week rejected EDP's proposal to buy the Galpenergia gas assets. The sides were scheduled to hold talks this week to find a possible solution.

An advisory committee of the EU's 25 member states with representatives from the countries' competition authorities are scheduled to meet on Friday to weigh the natural gas deal.
The Commission has until Dec. 15 to make a final decision on the deal.

Portugal is shifting 1.2 billion euros ($1.57 billion) in natural gas assets out of Galpenergia to make EDP more competitive with the launch of a single Iberian power market in June 2005.

EDP and Italian energy group ENI have proposed buying 51 percent and 49 percent, respectively, of Gas de Portugal, with the final make-up and value of the assets to be defined. Gas transport unit Transgas will go to REN, the state energy grid.

EDP shares were flat at 2.26 euros at 1330 GMT as the benchmark PSI20 index was off 0.18 percent. The DJ Stoxx utilities index was up 0.48 percent.

BRUSSELS/LISBON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Energias de Portugal (EDPP.IN) and Italy's  ENI (ENI.MI) plan to make a last-ditch bid on Monday to save a proposed purchase of state-controlled natural  gas firm Gas de Portugal, sources familiar with the situation said.

The European Commission has set Dec. 9 to vote on the deal, a second source said, in which  EDP and energy group ENI would buy 51 percent and 49 percent respectively of  Gas de Portugal from state-controlled Galpenergia.

Brussels has been concerned the 1.2 billion euros ($1.59 billion) deal would combine two monopolies and damage competition.
The president of EDP, Portugal's biggest industrial group, met last week with European Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes to offer changes to the deal.
But that was unsuccessful, the first source said, and EDP and ENI were set to make one last proposal on
Monday.

However, if that is rejected it will be too late for any more offers, the first source said. The Commission must act by Dec. 15 or the deal is automatically approved.

EDP is now considering withdrawing its proposal so the Commission cannot reject it, before returning with a new plan later, the source said.

That is something that would have been unthinkable until September, when an EU court decided such withdrawals were legal.

Portugal is restructuring EDP and the rest of its energy sector to face what is says will be increased competition after the launch of a single Iberian power market scheduled for June 2005.
But the Commission has rejected the idea that there will be a single Iberian power market any time soon. Document LBA0000020041129e0bt00b41

EU Antitrust Rejects Eni, EDP Plan to Acquire  GDP

(ANSA) - Brussels, November 30 - The antitrust authorities of the  European Union (EU) rejected the proposal of Italian energy group Eni SpA and Portuguese electricity provider Electricidade de Portugal (EDP) to acquire Portugal's natural gas company Gas de Portugal (GDP).

The negative decision was announced several days ago by competition commissioner Mario Monti and was confirmed on November 30, 2004 by the  European Commission (EC).

The decision, however, will be examined by a consultative committee, consisting of representatives from the national competition authorities, who will meet in mid-December 2004. Eni is likely to give up the operation or at least to change its current intentions, undisclosed sources said.

Portuguese consumers and businesses were already paying some of the highest electricity prices in the EU and this merger will not improve the situation, unless appropriate conditions are found, Monti said. Monti also regretted that it was not possible to find a solution to the problems identified by the EC. (ANSA).

The European Commission appears ready to block a plan for Italian energy group  Eni and Portuguese power group EDP to take over Gas de Portugal (GDP), the state-owned Portuguese  gas group, on grounds that the takeover would block the entry of new players on the Portuguese electricity market. The  EU's consultative committee on competition reportedly voted almost unanimously against the proposal, in spite of concessions proposed by EDP to address the  EU's concerns. The  EU decision, due on December 15, could reportedly be announced as early as December 9.

The EU's objections centres not so much on  Eni's participation in the deal, which called for the Italian group to maintain a 49 per cent stake in the  gas group, so much as on the semi-monopolistic merger between
state-owned  EDP and GDP.

EC Says Electricidade De Portugal's Changes to Merger Plan Are Unsatisfactory

It seems that last-ditch attempts made by Portugal's dominant electricity utility, Energias de Portugal (EDP), and Italy's  Eni have failed to persuade European Commission (EC) competition officials to allow the proposed merger between EDP and the dominant Portuguese gas utility, Gas de Portugal (GdP). The EC's competition spokesman, Jonathan Todd, was yesterday quoted as saying that they had not received any 'satisfactory remedies' to the problems the  EC has highlighted with the merger (see Portugal: 19 November 2004:  EC Set to Block Portuguese  EDP-GDP Merger on Competition Grounds). There had been speculation that  EDP would propose further concessions in order to secure the approval of the  EC over its planned purchase of a 51% stake in GdP (see Portugal: 22 November 2004: EDP Not Yet Giving Up on  GDP Merger Plans). The Italian company Eni would acquire the remaining 49% stake in GdP as part of the deal. The  EC argues that the merger of  EDP and GdP would be anti-competitive.

Significance: It seems highly unlikely that an eleventh hour compromise will be made. The EC is demanding concessions that EDP seems unwilling to make. The next move may be the withdrawal of the merger request by EDP to avoid having the deal officially rejected by the EC. For the Portuguese government, which strongly backed the merger as a means of creating a national champion in a deregulated European market, it may be a case of back to square one as alternative plans are explored.

PLATTS - Portugal's EDP argues tariff case in merger drive.

London (Platts)-3Dec2004/100 pm EST/1800 GMT Domestic electricity tariffs in Portugal are 19% higher than in neighboring Spain, but 7.6% lower than the pre-enlargement  European Union average, according to a new study by Energias de Portugal. For industrial consumers, Portuguese tariffs are slightly below the  EU average, EDP says. Tariffs are a key issue in the  European Commission's investigation into  EDP's proposed take-over of Gas de Portugal.  EDP produced the study to put the record straight in the face of other comparisons that it says fail to reflect the "different social and economic conditions" of the countries concerned.  Commission competition authorities-who say the consolidation could distort the market-are expected to formalize their rejection of the proposed merger on Dec 8.

UPDATE 3-EDP to stick to natgas plans despite Brussels.
By Sergio Goncalves

LISBON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Energias de Portugal (EDP) (EDPP.IN) will stick to its proposal to buy monopoly  Gas
de Portugal despite resistance from the European Commission, Chief Executive Joao Talone said on Monday.

EDP, Portugal's dominant power producer, will study alternatives if the  Commission turns down the deal to merge the state-controlled assets into  EDP, he said.

EDP's strategy "is to offer its customers two energies - electricity and gas", Talone told a news conference. The strategy "is one to keep and will have to be continued and reinforced".
Brussels cannot invoke consumer rights to disapprove of the deal, he said.
The European Commission's view on Portugal's attempt to merge EDP, Portugal's biggest industrial group, with
Gas de Portugal is seen as a precedent for other countries, such as France and Spain.

Portugal wants to hive off Gas de Portugal from state-controlled energy company Galpenergia to make EDP more competitive with the launch of a single Iberian power market in June 2005. EDP is 20.49 percent state owned.
DEAL REJECTED

Commission staff have rejected the deal, saying it involved the merger of two monopolies. The full Commission is scheduled to discuss it on Thursday.

Economic Affairs Minister Alvaro Barreto said Portugal's plans to carry out the merger and energy restructuring had been shelved because of Brussels' resistance and a political crisis with snap elections in view.

"I'm going to keep it as it is, with gas in Galp, without alterations," Barreto told Reuters on the margins of a parliamentary budget debate.

Under the deal, EDP and Italian energy group ENI (ENI.MI) would buy 51 percent and 49 percent respectively of Gas de Portugal from Galpenergia. If the deal fails to go forward ENI has the right to buy a controlling share of Galpenergia in February 2005.
Barreto said he had scheduled a meeting with ENI executives and is confident of resolving the issue.

Shares in EDP closed flat at 2.21 euros, as the benchmark PSI20 index ended down 0.15 percent. The DJ Stoxx utilities gauge was off 0.24 percent.
ENI shares closed up 0.53 percent at 18.18 euros. Document LBA0000020041206e0c6007vn

Energias De Portugal  Blasts  EU For Gas Deal Veto Plans

LISBON (Dow Jones)--Energias de Portugal SA (EDP) Monday slammed the European Union Commission for its expected decision to block a broad energy sector restructuring that would see EDP absorb natural gas producer Gas de Portugal.

EDP's chief executive, Joao Talone, stressed at a news conference that the  commission hasn't taken a final decision on the deal. But he added that whatever the commission decides, "it won't change in any way  EDP's strategy of the joint development of the electricity and gas businesses at the Iberian level."

Talone said the commission's proposals so far regarding the deal "reveal a clear political option: They oppose the creation of a large single market, an area of rationalization and competitiveness, on the pretense of creating competitive conditions within each national market, causing fragmentation of the companies within those markets, whatever their size."
Talone also said an eventual commission veto "would certainly not benefit Portuguese consumers."
EDP had planned to acquire GDP from GalpEnergia SA (GAP.YY) and create a new unit, EDP Gas, in which
Italian energy giant Eni SpA (E) would take a 49% stake.

The E.U. Commission has said it thinks the deal would consolidate too much market power in EDP in Portugal and has asked for a variety of concessions, in particular the sale of some generating assets.
EDP, for its part, argues that while it is the largest Portuguese generator, the case must be approached from an
Iberian perspective, where it is the fifth- or sixth-largest player.

Spain and Portugal have been working for years on a unified Iberian electricity market, called MIBEL, which is supposed to be operation next year.
Talone said the commission is expected to issue its final statement on the EDP/GDP deal later this week.

Portugal’s energy revamp collapses amid opposition from Brussels

Portugal’s plans to restructure its state-controlled energy sector to create a national champion collapsed in disarray on Monday because of opposition from the European Commission. The merger of the  gas assets of state holding company Galpenergia into Energias de Portugal (EDP) has been shelved in the face of resistance from Brussels, said economics minister Alvaro Barreto. After months of negotiations the Competition
Commission has hinted that it will reject the merger of power utility  EDP, Portugal’s largest company, with almost all the country’s  gas assets. A meeting of the  commission on Thursday this week is expected to result in a final decision on the plan, said industry sources in Portugal. The dispute has come to a head just after Portugal took over the presidency of the  European Commission. In talks since August  EDP made several concessions but negotiations broke down over Brussels’ insistence that the company sell off the new Ter 800 MW CCGT.

EDP, which had agreed to sell the new Sines LNG terminal, refused, according to banking sources in Lisbon. The setback means more delays in settling the future of the energy sector because since the talks began elections have been called for early next year. If the Socialist party replaces the Social Democrats the policy may change, say analysts. “There is a feeling in Portugal that EDP had made enough concessions and that the EU was being inflexible,” said an analyst. “This is bad for the group as the merger would have made it a more viable player in
the single Iberian energy market.” The European Commission is thought to see Portugal’s attempt to merge most of its gas and power assets as a dangerous precedent for other countries, such as Spain and France. It said a single Iberian energy market would take years to develop and rejected the argument that EDP needed to be
larger to compete with larger Spanish power and gas companies. The Portuguese government is due to meet Eni of Italy this week to discuss the fate of its 33% holding in Galpenergia. Under the merger plan the Italians were due to get 49% of Galpenergia’s gas assets, Gas de Portugal, and EDP 51%. DM

UPDATE 2-EDP fears precedent  if EU spurns  power/gas  deal.
By Ian Simpson

Reuters News
LBA

LISBON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - A disapproval from Brussels on the planned merger of monopoly  Gas de Portugal into power company Energias de Portugal (EDP) would set a precedent in  Europe, EDP Chief Executive Joao Talone said on Tuesday.

The Commission is due to decide on the deal on Thursday, and its staff have recommended it be blocked, saying it involves the merger of two monopolies.
Talone, however, noted that similar deals had already been carried out by French and German companies. He did not give examples, but Germany's E.ON and Ruhrgas and French diversified utility Suez's control of
Electrabel and Distrigaz are instances when power and gas companies have teamed up.

The current proposal calls for EDP to buy 51 percent of Gas de Portugal from state-controlled Galpenergia. In the deal, Portugal shifts 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in natural gas assets out of Galpenergia to make EDP more competitive with the launch of a single Iberian power market in June 2005.

EDP's proposal includes opening up the gas sector and selling or suspending its rights to stakes in other producers, and differs little from the Commission's position, Talone said.
"This makes a political option for the Commission," he told reporters at a briefing. If the deal is turned down, EDP
has no plans to submit a new proposal immediately, he said.
"The second thing is that it means that companies controlling government entities should be under watch by the
Commission."
In the deal, EDP and Italian energy group ENI buy 51 percent and 49 percent respectively of Gas de Portugal,
with the final make-up and value of the assets to be defined. Gas transport unit Transgas will go to REN, the state
energy grid.
EDP itself is 20.49 percent state owned.

Financial daily Diario Economico on Tuesday said investment holding Petrocer and ENI will prepare a joint proposal under which the 51 percent of Gas de Portugal would be parked with a non-state bank until the gas market is fully open.
This would avoid any objections by the Commission, the newspaper said, without specifying its sources. EDP could then buy the stake from the bank. Talone declined to comment on the report.
EDP shares were up 0.5 percent at 2.22 euros at 1350 GMT as the benchmark PSI20 index was up 0.2 percent and the DJ Stoxx utilities index was up 0.7 percent.

Petrocer, a private company, could take on the 51% of the  Gas de Portugal assets  EDP had planned to absorb, with Eni retaining the remainder. Because of the expected veto,  Eni will retain its 33% stake in GalpEnergia.

A plan for Italian oil and energy group to take a 49 per cent stake in Portuguese natural gas group Gas de Portugal (GDP), in partnership with Portuguese power group Electricidade de Portugal (EDP), looks set to be rejected by the  European Commission on December 9. The deal, part of the Portuguese government's plan to restructure the national energy industry, would see  EDP take a 51 per cent stake in  GDP, a situation that the Commission judged anti-competitive. If the deal is not approved and launched by February,  Eni could exercise a call option to take control of Galp, the Portuguese oil and energy conglomerate in which it holds a stake.

After hearing negative comments from recently retired competition commissioner Mario Monti and a negative opinion from the antitrust committee, EDP chairman Joao Talone has said that the group will not alter its proposal, while Portuguese economy minister Alvaro Barreta announced yesterday that the government would not make any new proposals either, due to a political crisis in the country. Both men appeared to indicate that EDP and the government - which holds a 20 per cent stake in the former monopoly power group - would seek to impugn an unfavourable ruling from the commission.

Eni Considers Alternatives after EC Blocks  EDP-Gaz de Portugal  Merger

The Italian oil and  gas company Eni is now looking at alternatives plans after the  European Commission (EC) indicated that it would reject the planned merger between Portugal's dominant electricity utility, Energias de Portugal (EDP) and the country's largest  gas utility, Gaz de Portugal (GDP). Eni had been set to acquire a 49% stake in GDP in exchange for its current 33.34% stake in the state-run oil and gas company Galp Energia. However, the deal, which the Portuguese government viewed as central to its energy strategy, also involved  EDP acquiring a 51% stake in  GDP from Galp Energia. It was this merger that caused concern in the  EC's competition directorate (see Portugal: 19 November 2004:  EC Set to Block Portuguese EDP-GDP Merger on Competition Grounds).  Eni is now looking at the possibility of acquiring the 49% stake in GDP with the 51% stake being put into provisional parking in a non-state bank, according to the local Diario Economico newspaper.
This would still leave open the possibility of EDP picking up the stake at a later date.

Significance: EDP has said that it will not withdraw its request to purchase the 51% stake in GDP from the EC, despite its likely rejection. The merger would have created an integrated Portuguese gas and power champion to compete in a deregulated market, but the EC worries it would set a precedent for France, which could merge its two utilities, Electricité de France (EDF) and Gaz de France (GdF). The EC decision has thrown the process into some disarray and it will probably be some time before a new strategy emerges. The possibility of Eni still acquiring the 49% stake seems possible, but the Portuguese government is likely to want to know the endgame before parking the 51% controlling stake in a bank.

EU Kroes Could Block Portuguese Power, Gas Cos Merging
605 words
8 December 2004
19:00
Dow Jones Energy Service
NRG
English
(c) 2004 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--In her first decisions as  European Union competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes is expected Thursday to block a merger between Portugal's power and  gas groups, and to slap fines on chemical companies for fixing prices.
In the Portuguese case, Kroes is expected to ask her 24 E.U.  Commission colleagues to block Energias de
Portugal SA (EDP) from buying Gas de Portugal SA, according to E.U. observers and news reports.
E.U. Commission investigators have warned that the deal, which also involves Italy's Eni SpA (E), would give EdP
too much control over the electricity generation and natural gas distribution market.

Earlier this month, EdP Chief Executive Joao Talone spoke out against E.U.'s expected veto, saying it "would certainly not benefit Portuguese consumers."
But Talone's criticism is unlikely to faze Kroes.

Kroes already has instructed her staff that a top priority for her five-year term as the region's most powerful regulator is to promote new entrants in energy markets still dominated by incumbent suppliers, like EdP.
In particular, E.U. regulators want to discourage consolidation among utilities in France, where power provider
Electricite de France (EDF.YY) dominates and has long resisted liberalization measures.

Thursday's Portuguese decision would be the first merger prohibition by European regulators since 2001. Kroes' predecessor Mario Monti shied away from blocking deals after judges at Europe's Court of First Instance overturned three of his decisions in 2002.

With the Monti era over, Kroes inherits a team of officials chastened by those court reversals - but emboldened by a new system ensuring that controversial decisions are more likely to stand up in court.
Kroes also inherits Monti's vigorous campaign to stamp out the worst violations of competition policy - price-fixing. On Thursday, Kroes is expected to impose fines on chemical companies that allegedly fixed the prices for an
animal feed additive called choline chloride, also known as vitamin B4.

Among the companies that could receive penalties are German chemical conglomerate BASF AG (BF) and Dutch company Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY), say people familiar with the matter.

The probe is part of a family of cases stemming from U.S. regulators' discovery of a widespread ring to rig the prices of vitamins worldwide during the 1990s. European regulators also investigated and punished the vitamins ring, slapping a then-record penalty - EUR462 million - on Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY) F. Hoffmann-La Roche.

E.U. regulators can fine companies caught fixing prices up to 10% of their most recent annual worldwide turnover, but fines usually are much smaller.

Kroes also could face questions Thursday about the E.U.'s campaign to force Germany's state-owned banks to restructure along market lines rather than through state subsidies.

Kroes already has warned the banks that any future recapitalization must take place after July 2005 and at proper market rates. But two of the banks, WestLB AG (WLB.YY) and Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale AG (NLB.YY) have sharply criticized those demands.


Page 60 of 117 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The current row began earlier this year, when the Commission asked WestLB and six other German state-owned banks pay back a total of EUR4.3 billion in state subsidies.

Those repayments were previously thought unlikely to weaken the financial situation of the banks because the federal states would immediately reinject the funds through recapitalizations - but now the E.U. and the German banks are quarreling over the conditions.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--In her first decisions as  European Union competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes is expected Thursday to block a merger between Portugal's power and  gas groups, and to slap fines on chemical companies for fixing prices.
In the Portuguese case, Kroes is expected to ask her 24 E.U.  Commission colleagues to block Energias de
Portugal SA (EDP) from buying Gas de Portugal SA, according to E.U. observers and news reports.
E.U. Commission investigators have warned that the deal, which also involves Italy's Eni SpA (E), would give EdP
too much control over the electricity generation and natural gas distribution market.

Earlier this month, EdP Chief Executive Joao Talone spoke out against E.U.'s expected veto, saying it "would certainly not benefit Portuguese consumers."
But Talone's criticism is unlikely to faze Kroes.

Kroes already has instructed her staff that a top priority for her five-year term as the region's most powerful regulator is to promote new entrants in energy markets still dominated by incumbent suppliers, like EdP.
In particular, E.U. regulators want to discourage consolidation among utilities in France, where power provider
Electricite de France (EDF.YY) dominates and has long resisted liberalization measures.

Thursday's Portuguese decision would be the first merger prohibition by European regulators since 2001. Kroes' predecessor Mario Monti shied away from blocking deals after judges at Europe's Court of First Instance overturned three of his decisions in 2002.

With the Monti era over, Kroes inherits a team of officials chastened by those court reversals - but emboldened by a new system ensuring that controversial decisions are more likely to stand up in court.
Kroes also inherits Monti's vigorous campaign to stamp out the worst violations of competition policy - price-fixing. On Thursday, Kroes is expected to impose fines on chemical companies that allegedly fixed the prices for an
animal feed additive called choline chloride, also known as vitamin B4.

Among the companies that could receive penalties are German chemical conglomerate BASF AG (BF) and Dutch company Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY), say people familiar with the matter.

The probe is part of a family of cases stemming from U.S. regulators' discovery of a widespread ring to rig the prices of vitamins worldwide during the 1990s. European regulators also investigated and punished the vitamins ring, slapping a then-record penalty - EUR462 million - on Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY) F. Hoffmann-La Roche.

E.U. regulators can fine companies caught fixing prices up to 10% of their most recent annual worldwide turnover, but fines usually are much smaller.

Kroes also could face questions Thursday about the E.U.'s campaign to force Germany's state-owned banks to restructure along market lines rather than through state subsidies.

Kroes already has warned the banks that any future recapitalization must take place after July 2005 and at proper market rates. But two of the banks, WestLB AG (WLB.YY) and Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale AG (NLB.YY) have sharply criticized those demands.

The current row began earlier this year, when the Commission asked WestLB and six other German state-owned banks pay back a total of EUR4.3 billion in state subsidies.

Those repayments were previously thought unlikely to weaken the financial situation of the banks because the federal states would immediately reinject the funds through recapitalizations - but now the E.U. and the German banks are quarreling over the conditions.

ENERGY: COMMISSION EXPECTED TO BLOCK EDP/ENI PLANS TO BUY GAS DE PORTUGAL
420 words
8 December 2004
Europe Information
EURREP
2919
English
(c) 2004 European Report.
EU Commissioners are expected to block a tie-up between Portugal’s  gas and electricity companies when they meet on December 9. If they back DG Competition’s recommendations, it will be the first merger the Commission has stopped since 2001. The  Commission believes that the sale of  Gas de Portugal to Energias de Portugal (EdP) and Italy’s  ENI energy group would allow the new company to become a dominant player
which would prevent other firms from entering the market (see issue 2904). In November,  EdP and ENI proposed several remedies to try and win  Commission approval for the deal - concessions  EU officials said did not go far enough.

According to an AFP report from Lisbon, EdP Chairman João Talone said the company had rejected conditions the Commission wanted to impose on the merger as they would have hit its electricity business as well as gas. The EU merger regulator had insisted that EdP give up its only gas-fired power station in Portugal, he said. EdP now wants to look at alternative ways to link up with GdP. Its partner, ENI, should be able to take a 49% stake in GdP without problems.

EdP insists that the Commission should look at the entire Iberian energy market (both Spain and Portugal) instead of focusing on Portugal alone. In EdP's view, this means it would not have a dominant market position and would be only the fifth or sixth largest firm in the region. It cited similar tie-ups between France and Belgium, referring to the merger between Suez and Tractebel. The Commission disagrees, saying the interconnection capacity between Spain and Portugal remains inadequate for the EdP/GdP deal to guarantee real competition
between power companies in both countries. Plans have been under way for some time to create a single energy market in the region - known as Mibel - but a precise timescale is still unclear.
--

Mr Talone said EdP had not withdrawn the plan as it had no word that the Commission planned to reject it. His comments fly in the face of reason; EU officials have clearly expressed their doubts about the merger - both in public and in private meetings with the companies. The Commission is generally reluctant to block mergers after it faced several embarrassing about-turns in the law courts in 2002 when its decisions to block the Airtours, Schneider Electric and Tetra Laval deals were struck down.

EU poised to kill EDP-ENI buy of Gas de Portugal.
By David Lawsky and Quentin Webb

(c) 2004 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The European Commission on Thursday planned to bar Electricidade de Portugal and Italy's  ENI from buying state-owned Gas de Portugal, issuing its first merger prohibition in three years.
Numerous Commission sources said it would turn down plans by  EDP, Portugal's biggest industrial group, to buy
51 percent and ENI to buy 49 percent of  Gas de Portugal, from Portugal's state energy company Galpenergia.

The EU's executive had feared the union of two dominant, former state-owned energy firms would damage competition, by strengthening EDP's dominant position in Portugal's wholesale and retail electricity markets, and making Gas de Portugal an overly dominant player on its national gas market.
Brussels opened a four-month, in-depth probe in August.

The decision should help underscore the independence of the Commission, which is led by President Jose Manuel Barroso. Barroso was formerly Portugal's prime minister and his administration had developed plans for the deal.

The ban is also one of the first high-profile decisions taken by new Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, who took office last month after enduring criticism in some quarters for her extensive business background.
EDP chief executive Joao Talone, antitipating the rejection, said earlier this week it would set a precedent.

He gave no examples, but others have cited the potential acquisition of Gaz de France by state-owned energy giant Electricite de France.

The decisive prohibition will follow years of caution, after a spurt of vetoes was overturned by the EU's second highest court, the Court of First Instance (CFI).

From 1994, the Commission had prohibited up to three mergers a year. In 2001 the Commission, operating at the peak of the merger boom, prohibited five different transactions.
But in 2002, the CFI threw out three prohibitions. It overturned a 1999 ban on the merger of British travel firms
Airtours and First Choice.

Then it rejected two 2001 prohibitions, one involving French electric equipment makers Schneider and Legrand and the other Tetra Laval's purchase of French bottle maker Sidel. A third, GE-Honeywell, is still on appeal.
The court said the Commission had done sloppy work and failed to prove its cases. Then-commissioner Mario
Monti reacted by overhauling and tightening internal review procedures..

Monti added a "devil's advocate" group to review deals with a fresh pair of eyes. That group has been central in forcing changes in decisions and prompting the Commission to think twice before prohibiting a merger.

He also added a chief economist to the Commission in 1993. Those in the Commission say that the chief economist carefully reviewed the decision so that its economic rationale could withstand legal scrutiny.

UPDATE 2-EU kills EDP-ENI aquisition of Gas de Portugal.
By David Lawsky and Quentin Webb

9 December 2004

(c) 2004 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The European Commission on Thursday barred two large energy companies from buying Portugal's main natural gas dealer, marking the  EU executive's first merger prohibition in three years.
The Commission said plans by Electricidade de Portugal (EDPP.IN) (EDP) and Italy's  ENI (ENI.MI) to buy  Gas
de Portugal would strangle the benefits of electricity liberalisation.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said she was vetoing the merger of two former state monopolies - one in the wholesale and retail electric market, the other in gas.

"This merger would have been bad for Portuguese consumers and bad for the competitiveness of Portuguese industry," Kroes told a news conference.

Portuguese Economic Affairs Minister Alvaro Barreto immediately said he would back any court appeal against the Commission.
"The EC continues to see the problem from a mistaken point of view," Barreto told reporters in Lisbon.

Portugal argued that instead of strengthening monopolies in in that country, the merger would pave the way for the firms to compete in a Spanish-Portuguese trading market opening in June.
The deal must "be seen and placed in - and only would make sense in - the context of the Iberian market and the
European market," Barreto said.
Kroes dismissed that argument in blunt words. PORTUGUESE 'NONSENSE'
"That is nonsense," she said, arguing that a Commission investigation demolished the argument that "an Iberian electricity market would emerge on a short-to-medium term basis ..."

The decision helped underscore the independence of the Commission led by President Jose Manuel Barroso, the former prime minister of Portugal.

Kroes said Barroso disqualified himself from participating in the decision, because the government he headed as prime minister developed the deal.

The decision gave Kroes ammunition against critics who claimed she would never stand up to big business because of her own experience in sitting on two dozen corporate boards.
She chided critics who said she "would be some kind of pussy cat for business."

"I promised that I would blow the whistle when it was needed and today I'll show you that this is put into practice," Kroes said.

The decisive prohibition follows years of caution, after a spate of vetoes was overturned by the EU's second highest court, the Court of First Instance (CFI).

From 1994, the Commission had prohibited up to three mergers a year. In 2001 the Commission, operating at the peak of the merger boom, prohibited five different transactions.

Monti added a "devil's advocate" group to review deals with a fresh pair of eyes. That group has been central in forcing changes in decisions and prompting the Commission to think twice before prohibiting a merger.

He also added a chief economist to the Commission in 2003. It was that economist who gave the Commission confidence that its analysis of the market would withstand any court challenge, those close to the decision said. (Additional reporting by Sergio Goncalves and Ian Simpson in Lisbon).

LISBON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Portugal could back Energias de Portugal in a possible appeal of Brussels' disapproval of its merger with  Gas de Portugal, Economic Affairs Minister Alvaro Barreto said on Thursday.

Speaking on the margins of a ceremony, Barreto said the  European Commission had turned down the merger because of its "mistaken point of view".

He said he planned to talk with Italian energy company ENI about the deal and Portugal would "never" let it control state energy company Galpenergia.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission Thursday blocked Energias de Portugal SA' (EDP)
effort to acquire  Gas de Portugal SA, citing competition concerns.

E.U. antitrust regulators said a tie-up between the two state-controlled utilities would give  EdP too much sway over the electricity generation and natural  gas distribution markets in Portugal and would impede competition, leading to higher prices for residential and industrial consumers. [ 12-09-04 0530ET ]

The Portuguese deal would have given EDP a 51% stake in Gas de Portugal and Italian power company ENI SpA (E) would have held 49%.

E.U. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said strengthening the already dominant positions of the electricity and gas suppliers would result in higher prices and reduce competitiveness in Portugal.
"In the absence of adequate remedies, the Commission was obliged to prohibit the deal," she added.

Since taking office last month, Kroes has told her staff a top priority of her term is to promote new entrants in energy markets still dominated by incumbent suppliers, like EdP in Portugal.

Kroes underscored the point in Thursday decision, saying she wants to "prevent companies clubbing together to neutralize the effects of," the ongoing deregulation of the E.U.'s energy markets.

Kroes didn't name any specific companies or countries. Privately, however, E.U. regulators have expressed concerns about consolidation among utilities in France, where power provider Electricite de France (EDF.YY) dominates and has long resisted liberalization measures.

Thursday's decision is the first merger prohibition by E.U. regulators since 2001. Kroes' predecessor Mario Monti shied away from blocking deals after judges at Europe's Court of First Instance overturned three of his decisions in 2002.

London (Platts)-9Dec2004/657 am EST/1157 GMT The European Commission has blocked the planned joint purchase of Gas de Portugal by Energias de Portugal and Italy's ENI because the deal would have "impeded effective competition," the EC said Thursday. "After an in-depth investigation, the  Commission concluded that the deal would strengthen EDP's dominant position in the electricity wholesale and retail markets in Portugal and GDP's dominant position in Portuguese  gas markets," the EC said. The  Commission said the proposed deal would negatively impact liberalization in electricity and gas markets, and increase prices for domestic and industrial customers. Measures proposed by  EDP and ENI to allay competition concerns were "insufficient," the EC said. "The  Commission must ensure that consumers benefit from more effective competition, in terms of choice of supplier and lower prices, following mergers," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

"Effective competition on their home market also ensures that suppliers are efficient and better able to penetrate other markets."

Brussels (Platts)-9Dec2004/714 am EST/1214 GMT New competition commissioner Neelie Kroes signaled her intent to beef up competition in energy markets Thursday after the  European Commission blocked the proposed takeover of  Gas de Portugal by  Eni and Energias de Portugal. "Securing better competition in new markets like energy is a priority for me," she told journalists in Brussels. "This merger would have been bad for Portuguese consumers, bad for the competitiveness of Portuguese industry, would have undermined the benefits of the internal energy market in Portugal and excluded new entrants." Portugal's electricity incumbent  EDP and Italy's gas incumbent Eni had sought to buy Portugal's  gas incumbent GDP for Eur1.2-bil ($1.6-bil). But the  EC was concerned about the effect on energy market competition in Portugal and the remedies proposed by the companies failed to overcome these concerns, said Kroes.

"I regret we couldn't come to a deal." But the EC couldn't accept "a quasi-monopoly for an indefinite period in the energy sector in Portugal," she said.

La Stampa: Brussels to turn down Eni and EDP on takeover of Gas de Portugal  (Gas portoghese, oggi il no della Ue all'Eni).

Europe's new competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, is expected today to announce a negative decision on the proposed takeover of Portuguese  gas group Gas de Portugal (GDP) by Portuguese electricity group Electricidade de Portugal and Italian oil and energy conglomerate Eni, which was to take a 49 per cent stake.
Various sources yesterday confirmed that the  Commission would disapprove of the plan, after  EDP's proposals
in response to Brussels' objections on competition grounds were deemed unsatisfactory.  EDP said that conditions
suggested by the  Commission, such as the sale of its  gas plant in Portugal, were too restrictive, and would
jeopardise the company's value.

EU COMMISSION VETOES EDP-ENI ACQUISITION OF GDP
528 words
9 December 2004

The European Commission has decided to prohibit the proposed acquisition of joint control over  Gás de Portugal (Gdp) by Energias de Portugal (Edp) and Eni (see SN n° 44, pag. 4) because “the deal would have impeded effective competition.”

After an in-depth investigation, a Dec. 9 communiqué explains, the  commission concluded that the deal would strengthen  Edp's dominant position in the electricity wholesale and retail markets in Portugal and  Gdp's dominant position in Portuguese  gas markets. The concentration would thus “significantly reduce or pre-empt the effects of liberalization of the electricity and gas markets, and increase prices for domestic and industrial customers.” Remedies proposed by Edp and Eni were considered by the  EU commission “insufficient” to satisfy the competition concerns.

Competition commissioner Neelie Kroes stated: “The commission must ensure that consumers benefit from more effective competition, in terms of choice of supplier and lower prices, following mergers. Effective competition on their home market also ensures that suppliers are efficient and better able to penetrate other markets. Ensuring effective competition in newly-liberalized markets such as energy is a priority for me, to prevent companies clubbing together to neutralize the effects of new market access. In this specific case, the strengthening of the dominant positions of the existing electricity and gas suppliers would have resulted in higher prices for
Portuguese consumers and industrial users, and so a loss of competitiveness for the Portuguese economy. In the absence of adequate remedies, the commission was obliged to prohibit this operation.”

Edp, the incumbent electricity operator in Portugal, generates, distributes, and supplies electricity in Portugal. Through its Spanish affiliates Hidrocantabrico and Naturcorp, Edp also has substantial electricity and gas activities in Spain.

Gdp, the incumbent gas operator in Portugal, is active at all levels of the gas chain in Portugal. Gdp has exclusive rights for the import, storage, transportation, and wholesale supply of natural gas, and it controls five of the six Portuguese local gas distribution companies (the sixth being controlled by Edp).

Portuguese electricity markets are now fully opened to competition, and Portuguese gas markets are due to be progressively opened in accordance with the second EU gas directive (2003/92/EC). This process is set to begin soon with the opening of natural gas supply to power generators.
The commission analyzed the possible impact of the proposed operation on the gas and electricity supply
markets in Portugal and concluded that the transaction would strengthen Edp's dominant position in the electricity
wholesale and retail markets in Portugal. In particular, it would “remove Gdp's potential to compete in the
electricity markets.” Furthermore, since gas is now one of the most efficient ways to produce electricity, the
concentration would have made “current and possible future power producers in Portugal dependent on their
main competitor, namely Edp.”

The concentration, according to the EU commission, would also strengthen Gdp's dominant position in the relevant gas markets in Portugal, through the “foreclosure of a significant part of the gas demand (controlled by Edp) and the elimination of Edp as most likely entrant in the gas markets.”

(EU) EU/COMPETITION: Decision  on Gas de Portugal  and on cartel

Brussels, 08/12/2004 (Agence  Europe) - The Commission, which met on Thursday instead of Wednesday due
to the EU/China summit (see other article) will take two decisions on "a cartel and a merger", its spokesperson for
Competition has confirmed.

Recently, the  Commission's competition services proposed to reject plans of Portuguese electricity company EDP and the Italian company  ENI to acquire the Portugal natural  gas company Gas de Portugal (GDP) (EUROPE of 23 November). At the time being, it appears that the actions proposed by  EDP to ensure that competition would not be distorted have not materialised, and are not enough to justify a decision in its favour.

The anti-trust case related to a cartel in the field of vitamin B4. According to Reuters, quoting a source close to the investigation, several chemical companies, including the European UBC (Belgium), BASF (Germany) and Akzo Nobel (Netherlands), will be found guilty of fixing the price of choline chlorure (vitamin B4), a supplement used in animal feed.

EC Rejects Italy Eni, Portuguese EDP Acquisition of GDP

(ANSA) - Brussels, December 9 - The  European Commission (EC) said it had decided to reject the offer of Italian energy group Eni SpA and Portuguese electricity provider Electricidade de Portugal (EDP) to acquire Portugal's natural gas company Gas de Portugal (GDP), it was reported on December 9, 2004.

After an in-depth investigation, the  commission concluded that the deal would strengthen  EDP's dominant position on the electricity wholesale and retail markets in Portugal and  GDP's dominant position on the Portuguese  gas market.

According to the EC, the concentration of energy groups in the Portuguese market would significantly reduce the effects of liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets. [Editor's note: The antitrust authorities of the European Union (EU) rejected the proposal of Eni SpA and EDP to acquire GDP, on November 30, 2004. Eni is likely to give up the operation or at least to change its current intentions, undisclosed sources said.] (ANSA).

E.U. antitrust regulators said a tie-up between the two state-controlled utilities would give  EdP too much sway over the electricity generation and natural  gas distribution markets in Portugal and would impede competition, leading to higher prices for residential and industrial consumers. [ 09-12-04 1030GMT ]

The Portuguese deal would have given EDP a 51% stake in Gas de Portugal and Italian power company ENI SpA (E) would have held 49%.

E.U. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said strengthening the already dominant positions of the electricity and gas suppliers would result in higher prices and reduce competitiveness in Portugal.
"In the absence of adequate remedies, the Commission was obliged to prohibit the deal," she added.

Since taking office last month, Kroes has told her staff a top priority of her term is to promote new entrants in energy markets still dominated by incumbent suppliers, like EdP in Portugal.

Kroes underscored the point in Thursday decision, saying she wants to "prevent companies clubbing together to neutralize the effects of," the ongoing deregulation of the E.U.'s energy markets.

Kroes didn't name any specific companies or countries. Privately, however, E.U. regulators have expressed concerns about consolidation among utilities in France, where power provider Electricite de France (EDF.YY) dominates and has long resisted liberalization measures.

Thursday's decision is the first merger prohibition by E.U. regulators since 2001. Kroes' predecessor Mario Monti shied away from blocking deals after judges at Europe's Court of First Instance overturned three of his decisions in 2002.

NEWS SNAP: EU Nixes Portugal  Gas Merger, Warns France

MADRID (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission announced Thursday its first veto of a merger since
2001, blocking Energias de Portugal SA's (EDP) effort to acquire  Gas de Portugal SA, and sending a veiled
warning against similar moves in the French energy market.

The decision, which the  Commission based on competition concerns, isn't expected to have an impact on operations at  EDP, Portugal's largest utility, but complicates the picture for mergers and acquisitions in that market.
Spokesmen for EDP and GDP weren't immediately available for comment.
EDP intended to swap its 14% stake in oil concern Galpenergia SA (GAP.YY) for a 51% stake in Gas de
Portugal, Galpenergia's gas unit. The deal also included Italian utility Eni SpA (E), which was supposed to take a
49% stake in Gas de Portugal - and the Commission veto means the whole sector is now up for grabs.

In addition, the decision "must be seen as a clear message" for Electricite de France (EDF.YY), about its own plan to merge with Gaz de France, said an equities trader in Lisbon.

"This is not terrible news for EDP, since it was somewhatexpected," he said. "The important thing is that they're just using EDP as an example. They don't want that kind of a deal in Europe."
At 1301 GMT, EDP's shares were down 0.5% at EUR2.22, slightly underperforming the wider Portuguese market. E.U. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said Thursday that the EDP-GDP deal would have resulted in
higher prices and reduced competition in Portugal.

Kroes took office last month and has already instructed her staff that a top priority for her five-year term as the region's most powerful regulator is to promote new entrants within E.U. energy markets. Both EDP and EdF are still state-owned and battle little outside challenge.
"EDP is facing a pretty messy situation right now," said Enrique Soldevila, analyst with brokerage BPI. Soldevila noted that EDP is now expected to deliver a new strategy for the gas market in a presentation
scheduled for Dec. 15. Any such plans will be unveiled amid political uncertainty as Portugal will hold a general
elections early next year.
The current Portuguese government was supportive of the deal between EDP and Galpenergia.

The merger veto also allows Eni and Spanish utility Endesa SA (ELE) to face a whole new ball-game in Portugal, Soldevila added. He has an accumulate rating on EDP, with a EUR2.42 share-price target.

Both companies have shown interest to increase their footprint in the Portuguese energy market, and the decision is expected to pave the way for them, among any other possible entrants.

Endesa plans to invest a total of EUR9 billion in both Spain and Portugal over the next five years, but hasn't specified how much would be invested in Portugal over that period.
Endesa owns a 35% stake in Portugal's Tejo Energia and has a 50-50 joint venture with conglomerate Sonae
SGPS (SONAE.LB) to sell electricity to end users.

Brussels’ veto of Portugal’s energy merger will hurt consumers, says EDP

The European Commission on Thursday rejected the merger of Portugal’s largest company, Energias de Portugal (EDP), with Gas de Portugal, which owns most of the country’s  gas assets. The  Commission said that plans by EDP to buy 51% and for  Eni of Italy to acquire the remaining 49% of  Gas de Portugal would create barriers to competition. “Ensuring effective competition in newly liberalised markets such as energy is a priority for me,” said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. “The strengthening of the dominant positions of the existing electricity and  gas suppliers would have resulted in higher prices for Portuguese consumers and industrial users, and so a loss of competitiveness for the Portuguese economy.” Brussels’ first merger prohibition in three years ends a four-month inquiry and lengthy negotiations with  EDP and the Portuguese government.

The Commission said the union of two dominant state-controlled energy firms would reinforce EDP’s dominant position in Portugal’s wholesale and retail electricity markets, and make Gas de Portugal an overly dominant player on its national gas market. The step was widely expected and EDP announced its reaction in a statement on Monday. The move was “a clear political choice,” it said, “in favour of the supposed creation of competitive conditions within each national market at the cost of fragmenting the companies in that market, whatever its size. This precedent now created will need to be observed in the future by the Commission.” “There was a considerable effort to find mutually acceptable solutions by the Commission’s departments on one hand and by EDP and Eni on the other. EDP has always shown a great flexibility in an attempt to correspond to the Commission’s main concerns,” said EDP. “The advances in the negotiations leading up to the final proposal would have made it possible to anticipate the creation of effective competitive conditions in gas distribution and supply (which will only be totally reached in 2011 in the present framework) and in electricity generation, with clear benefits for Portuguese consumers,” the company said. “Therefore, although this may contribute to the advancement of the Commission’s above-mentioned political objectives, the possible rejection of this transaction will surely not be done in benefit of the Portuguese consumers,” EDP said. The group plans to continue its strategy to develop both gas and power interests in the Iberian market without Gas de Portugal. The government has said it does not expect to make a new proposal. DM

THE European Commission is expected to fine three chemical firms - Dutch Akzo Nobel, German BASF AG and Belgian UCB - a total of l66 million today (9 December) for running a cartel on vitamin B-4, a pet-food supplement.

THE European Commission is expected to block a merger of Portugal’s main power and  gas groups, EDP and GDP, today (9 December) because of fears of market domination.  EDP and the Portuguese government failed to convince the Commission that the deal should be considered in the context of the Iberian Peninsula market instead of the Portuguese market alone.
EU EMPLOYMENT ministers were again unable to reach agreement on EU rules on working time on Tuesday (7
December). A blocking minority of France, Belgium, Sweden, Greece and Spain voted down the compromise to
allow employees to opt-out of the EU’s maximum 48-hour working week through agreements between their trade
unions and employers. But ministers did decide that ‘on call’ time, which often applies to doctors, should not count
as working time.

ITALY’S finance ministry said on Tuesday that it was looking into its national accounts after the European Commission said it was not satisfied with Rome’s explanation of why its published deficit levels have been lower than its borrowing requirements. The ministry said the discrepancies, in 2001-03, were due to the way Italy had accounted for public deposits and the transfer of some government holdings to semi-autonomous holdings.

EUROZONE finance ministers published a joint statement calling the rise of the euro an "unwelcome movement" and calling on "all major countries and economic areas" to "play their part more actively in reducing global imbalances".

EU FINANCE ministers backed a proposal imposing new capital requirements on banks according to the risks that they take. The proposal, which implements the global Basel II accord on banking solvency, has to be approved by the European Parliament before it can become law. Ministers also approved tightened rules for EU auditors and agreed stricter control on cash payments above _15,000 at places such as casinos and currency exchange bureaux.
EU TRADE chief Peter Mandelson held talks with US Trade Representative
Robert Zoellick in Paris on Monday (6 December) over the issue of subsidies for Europe’s Airbus and America’s
Boeing air carriers, but told journalists that no alternative to a WTO litigation case had been found.

Europe Blocks  Gas Deal in Portugal  on Competition Grounds
523 words
10 December 2004
International Oil Daily
IOD
English

The European Commission formally announced on Thursday that it was blocking a proposed takeover of  Gas
de Portugal (GdP) by a joint venture of state power company Energias de Portugal (EdP) and Italy's  Eni.

GdP has exclusive gas import and wholesale supply rights in Portugal and was valued at €1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) when its takeover was agreed in April 2004 by its state-controlled parent Galpenergia and the  EdP-Eni venture. The European Union began its probe in mid-August (IOD Aug.16,p1).
EdP is Portugal's incumbent electricity supplier and, through affiliates Hidrocantabrico and Naturcorp, active in
Spain too.

Italy's Eni, the largest publicly listed shareholder in Galpenergia, sought a 49% stake in GdP to bolster its gas sales regionally.

In her first big takeover veto since becoming EU competition commissioner last month, Neelie Kroes said: "In this specific case, the strengthening of the dominant positions of the existing electricity and gas suppliers would have resulted in higher prices for Portuguese consumers and industrial users, and so a loss of competitiveness for the Portuguese economy. In the absence of adequate remedies, the commission was obliged to prohibit this operation" (IOD Nov.22,p6).

Portugal's Economy Minister Alvaro Barreto is understood to have known about the decision on Monday, when he told parliament that any blocking of the GdP takeover would leave it in state-controlled Galpenergia's hands. That same day, EdP stated that, whatever the EU's decision, it "will not change [EdP's] strategy for jointly developing the Iberian electricity and gas businesses."

The commission analyzed the takeover's possible impact, particularly concerns that "it would remove GdP's potential to compete in the electricity markets."

"As gas is now one of the most efficient ways to produce electricity, the concentration would have made current and possible future power producers in Portugal dependent on their main competitor, namely EdP," the commission said.

The takeover would have bolstered GdP's dominance of Portugal's gas markets, and ruled out EdP as a future gas entrant, the commission also said.

Potentially, the EU veto could unpick a complex restructuring, and further privatization, of Galpenergia as a solely oil business.

In early August, Portugal's government signed a contract to permit the sale of 40.8% of Galpenergia to Petrocer -- a consortium made up of local private equity fund Viacer and Banco Portugues de Investimento -- for €856.4 million ($1.15 billion).

Essentially the lion's share of that stake belongs to Eni, which was to have received 49% of GdP in exchange (IOD Aug.5,p8). EdP was to have received its 51% of GdP through a similarly complex mix of asset swaps and cash payments.

The European Commission's new president, Jose Manuel Barroso, was prime minister of Portugal when it hatched the GdP and Galpenergia deals. Barroso did not participate in the commission vote on GdP, said Kroes.

The European Commission was this week expected to block the proposed merger of Portugal's Energias de
Portugal (EDP) and Gas de Portugal (GDP).
The decision, expected after Utility Week went to press, would be the first merger vetoed by the  Commission
since 2001 and could set a precedent for future attempts to create national champions.

EDP had planned to take over GDP with Italian oil and gas company Eni. They hoped the creation of the pan-Iberian energy market, scheduled to start in 2005, would assuage fears about market dominance.

Newly installed Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said she would block the deal on the grounds that it was anti-competitive for the Portuguese market. The move is an embarrassment for for Commission president Jose Antonio Barroso, who had championed the merger when he was prime minister of Portugal.

The European Commission yesterday blocked the takeover of Portuguese  gas group Gas De Portugal (GDP) by electricity group Energias De Portugal (EDP) and Italian oil and energy conglomerate Eni, on grounds that the deal would create a near-monopoly in Portugal's electricity and  gas market. The Commission said that concessions offered by the two groups in response to its objections were unsatisfactory.

Eni was to take a 49 per cent stake in  GDP, against  EDP's planned 51 per cent, in exchange for its current 36.3 per cent stake in Portuguese oil and energy conglomerate Galpenergia. If the deal does not go through by February,  Eni will gain the right to a controlling stake in Galpenergia, though the Italian company has not said whether it wishes to exercise that right, and Portuguese economy minister Alvaro Barreto has said that he would not allow the takeover.

As Expected, EU Officially Blocks  EDP-GDP Merger

The European Commission hasformally ruled thatEnergias de Portugal (EDP) and Eni's proposed acquisition of gas distributor, Gás de Portugal (GDP) is anti-competitive and would limit effective competition in the Portuguese energy market (see Portugal: 9 December 2004:  EU Set to Block  EDP-Gaz de Portugal Merger Today). The merger would have strengthened the companies' hold over the Portuguese electricity and  gas markets, but would have limited market access for other companies - 'a sin in our dictionary of competition,' according to Neelie Kroes, the  European Union's new competition commissioner. She felt that Portuguese consumers would lose out under such an energy monopoly.  EDP is involved in all aspects of the Portuguese power market and has operations in the Spanish  gas and power market through its subsidiaries, Hidrocantábrico and Naturcorp. GDP carries out gas distribution in Portugal, while Italy's  Eni has interests in the upstream, downstream, natural gas and power markets.

Significance: The attempt to wrap up access to the Portuguese electricity and gas markets before further liberalisation measurestake place has beenblocked byEU competition laws and a Commissioner with a statement to make on antitrust cases, following three years of M&A quiescence by the EU where veto powers have not been invoked. The veto means thatPortugal's electricity and gas marketremains as is, potentially enabling other players to get involved in a more limited capacity asderegulation and reforms are unrolled.Portugal's government will be disappointed by the lack of a stronger energy champion to take on other European markets, but there is also a clear warning message in Kroes' decisionfor otherenergy majors hoping to cut a dash in semi-liberalised EU markets through corporate M&A.

(EU) EU/COMPETITION: Neelie Kroes' first opposition to merger involves EDP and ENI's take-over of Gas de Portugal

Brussels, 09/12/2004 (Agence Europe) - On 9 December, as expected, the European Commission refused the planned takeover of the historic Gas de Portugal (GDP) by Energias de Portugal (EDP) and Italian energy company ENI. Neelie Kroes the Commissioner for competition explained that at the end of an investigation that was both "scrupulous and meticulous", the  Commission's opinion was shared almost unanimously by the national competition authorities. The Commissioner believes that this merger would have been bad for both Portuguese consumers and the competitiveness of Portuguese industry. She listed the problems and risks that this operation would have created and how the reduced benefits of the liberalisation of the energy market would be lost by excluding new competitors onto the Portuguese market, which would lead to price rises and competitive disadvantages for industry as a whole.

The Commission's analysis focused on the electricity, now open, and the gas market which is gradually being opened up and the soon to be liberalised natural gas suppliers and energy producers. Commissioner Kroes considers that the merger could have led to a situation where there was a monopoly of the merged company on the wholesale electricity and gas markets in Portugal. The operation would mean that the two firms, potentially rivals on open markets, would be shut out of the markets on which one of them was dominant. The deal would have made current and future energy producers in Portugal dependent on their supply from their main competitor, EDP, the Commission concluded.

According to the project, EDP and ENI were expected to hold 51% and 49% respectively of GDP but their proposals for finding a solution were not sufficient. Kroes indicated that in the absence of corrective satisfactory measures, the Commission had ruled out the operation. Asked about the Commission's expectation regarding satisfactory counter measures, Kroes explained that she wanted to be cautious at this stage and if companies could demonstrate that they now had competitive elements there would be no problem.

Kroes also said that she was "impressed by the attitude of president Barroso who had never interfered in the procedure although he had bee the instigator of the opposed project when he was Portuguese prime minister. According to the current economic affairs minister in Portugal, quoted by Reuters, "the Commission is continuing to analyse the problem from a bad point of view". Alvaro Barreto, the minister, said that the decision should have taken into account the Iberian and European market as a whole and not restrict itself to Portugal to analyse the impact of the operation on competition and consumers. Barreto said that the Portuguese government may support EDP, if the Portuguese company decided to appeal against the decision.

The European Commission on Dec. 9 formally prohibited a proposed takeover of  Gas de Portugal (GdP) by a
51:49 joint venture of Energias de Portugal (EdP), the country's incumbent power supplier, and Italy's Eni.

GdP, which has a monopoly on Portuguese  gas imports and wholesale supply rights, was valued at €1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) when the takeover was agreed to in April by its state-controlled parent, Galpenergia, and  EdP/Eni. The Italian firm, the largest publicly-listed shareholder in Galpenergia, was seeking a 49% stake to bolster its regional gas sales.

The commission's probe began in mid-August. In her first big merger veto since becoming EU competition commissioner last month, Neelie Kroes said: "The strengthening of the dominant positions of the existing electricity and gas suppliers would have resulted in higher prices for Portuguese consumers and industrial users, and so a loss of competitiveness for the Portuguese economy" (EC Nov.19,p9). Kroes' boss, new European
Commission head Jose Manuel Barroso, was Portuguese prime minister at the time the deal was hatched in early
2004.

The Portuguese state,  EDP's leading shareholder with a 20 per cent stake, wanted to create a really powerful gas and electricity group for the domestic market, but which would also have a strong presence in the Spanish market through power group Hidrocantabrico and Basque  gas company Naturcorp.

EDP could now choose to grow by expanding in the Spanish electricity sector. The Portuguese group has just carried out a 1.2bn-euro issue to finance an increase of its stake in Spanish electricity group Hidrocantabrico from
39 to 95 per cent. Hidrocantabrico holds a 5 per cent share of the Spanish gas and electricity market. Analysts say that EDP could form an alliance with Spanish power group Union Fenosa, which controls 12 per cent of the domestic market. Both groups would be willing to gain a stronger position to face their main rivals in this market: power groups Endesa and Iberdrola, and gas group Gas Natural. Meanwhile, leading Spanish bank Santander Central Hispano (SCH) could be willing to sell its 23 per cent stake in Union Fenosa if it receives an interesting offer. Speculation drove Union Fenosa's share price up 1.51 per cent yesterday to close the session at 19.55 euros, giving the group a stock market capitalization of 5.9bn euros. The possibility of an alliance could be jeopardized by their current combined debts of 14bn euros, plus the power which the Portuguese state would have in the resulting group. Meanwhile, Iberdrola could use its 5 per cent stake in EDP to try and form an alliance with the group.

EU moves to bar 'protective' mergers:  Competition commissioner puts interests of consumers first as
planned Portuguese energy takeover is thrown  out

Neelie Kroes, the  EU's controversial new competition commissioner, yesterday signalled to the French authorities that she would block any attempt to protect France's energy market by engineering a merger between its
state-owned electricity and  gas groups.

In her first high-profile decision Ms Kroes, a Dutch liberal, threw out a planned takeover by Electricidade de Portugal and Italy's  ENI of state-owned  Gas de Portugal - the  commission's first ban on a merger for almost three years.

Aides to the commissioner said the move sent a clear message to France and others that protective national mergers designed to prevent foreign takeovers would be ruled out.

Her decision, accompanied by clear warnings that the interests of consumers would be paramount in such cases, is an effective green light for foreign takeovers of national incumbents in domestic EU energy markets - a longstanding demand of British players such as Centrica, owner of British Gas.

Ms Kroes, who has been accused by her critics of being a lame duck commissioner because of conflicts of interest caused by her extensive business background, hit back by insisting she was no "pussy cat" and would blow the whistle on corporate activity she considers inimical to competition. She set out a policy of "zero tolerance" towards cartels by imposing fines of euros 66.34m (pounds 45.9m) on Akzo Nobel, BASF and Belgium's UCB for operating a cartel in the market for an animal feed vitamin known as choline chloride.

But it is her ban on the Por tuguese merger, the first since her predecessor, Mario Monti, beat a retreat after the European court of justice rescinded three of his vetoes on such transactions in 2002, that underlines the new commission's tougher attitude towards anti-competitive corporate behaviour.

EDP planned to take 51% and ENI 49% of GDP but Ms Kroes said the takeover would have undermined the benefits of energy liberalisation, due to be completed throughout the EU later this decade, excluded new entrants, meant higher prices for retail and business consumers and eroded the competitive position of Portuguese
industry.

Alvaro Barreto, Portugal's economic affairs minister, said he would back any court appeal against the commission, arguing that the deal would help firms compete in a wider Iberian market. But Ms Kroes, who said she had held repeated talks with Mr Barreto, said there was no evidence an Iberian market with Spain would emerge "on a short to medium-term basis".
France, which wants to part-privatise EDF and GDF, its electricity and gas groups, next year, has considered a
"Franco-French" merger between the two to prevent any foreign bid for either.

She said: "Effective competition on their home market also ensures that suppliers are efficient and better able to penetrate other markets. Ensuring effective competition in newly-liberalised markets such as energy is a priority for me - to prevent companies clubbing together to neutralise the effects of new market access."
Ms Kroes did, however, wave through the acquisition of British cement-producer RMC by Mexico's Cemex. Document GRDN000020041209e0ca00067

Brussels blocks  Portuguese energy sector acquisition

EDP and ENI's plan to buy  GDP would prevent competition

The European Commission Thursday decided to block the proposed joint acquisition of  Gás de Portugal by Energias de Portugal and Italy's  ENI, arguing the move would stymie effective competition in the Portuguese energy market.

An in-depth probe by the European Union's competition commission concluded that the deal would strengthen EDP's dominant position in the wholesale and retail electricity markets in Portugal and GDP's dominant position in the country's gas markets.

As a result, the EU said the acquisition would pre-empt efforts to liberalize the energy sector in Portugal and lead to higher energy prices for households and industrial customers. The Commission rejected proposals by EDP and ENI aimed at meeting its concerns about the deal as insufficient.

"Ensuring effective competition in newly-liberalized markets such as energy is a priority for me, to prevent companies clubbing together to neutralize the effects of new market access," the new European Union commissioner for competition, Neelie Kroes, said in announcing the decision,"

"In this specific case, the strengthening of the dominant positions of the existing electricity and gas suppliers would have resulted in higher prices for Portuguese consumers and industrial users, and so a loss of competitiveness for the Portuguese economy," Kroes added. "In the absence of adequate remedies, the Commission was obliged to prohibit this operation," she concluded.

EDP generates, distributes and supplies electricity in Portugal, and also has significant operations in the Spanish gas and electricity markets through its subsidiaries Hidrocantábrico and Naturcorp. GDP has an effective monopoly of the gas distribution business in Portugal, while privatized group ENI operates in the oil and natural gas, electricity generation, engineering and construction and petrochemical sectors.

Portugal's electricity market is now fully open to competition, while its gas market is to be opened progressively in line with a directive by the European Union.

ENERGY: EU BLOCKS "BAD"  EDP/GDP MERGER
935 words
11 December 2004

EURREP
2920
English
(c) 2004 European Report.
The European Commission has blocked a tie-up between Portugal's major  gas and electricity suppliers, the first merger it has opposed since 2001. In her first press conference as  EU Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes described the deal as a "bad proposal" which would have strengthened the dominant position of the country's incumbent electricity firm Energias de Portugal (EdP) as well as Gás de Portugal. The companies' refusal to take on board the Commission's concerns had forced her hand: "In the absence of adequate remedies, the Commission was therefore obliged to prohibit this operation", she said.

EdP had planned to take a 51% stake in GdP, with Italy's ENI energy group buying the remaining 49%. In August, the EU merger regulator said it had serious concerns about the deal (see issue 2891), believing it would allow
EdP to take a large slice of the gas market and cancel out GdP as a possible rival in the electricity sector. EdP now wants to look at alternative ways to link up with GdP. Its partner, ENI, should be able to buy part of GdP without any problems.
A careful decision.

Mrs Kroes said the Commission had "very carefully considered" its decision to block the merger. EU officials had carried out a very thorough investigation and an in-depth economic analysis of the case. Their conclusions had won the "almost unanimous" backing of the Member States' competition authorities, she said. The Commission is generally reluctant to block mergers after it faced several embarrassing about-turns in the law courts in 2002 when its decisions to block the Airtours, Schneider Electric and Tetra Laval deals were struck down.

The Commission has clearly expressed its doubts about the merger - both in public and in private meetings with the companies. "Prior to the decision, we held very frank and constructive negotiations with the Portuguese Government and in particular with the Portuguese Minister for Energy Mr Baretto, with whom I spoke personally on two occasions", Mrs Kroes said. The former Portuguese Prime Minister who championed the deal in its early days - now Commission President José Manuel Barroso - had not tried to influence the Commission's decision in any way, she insisted.

The EU competition authority had identified ways in which EdP could avoid the anti-competitive effects of the transaction. The Commission said the companies were not able to offer "appropriate remedies" which would meet its concerns that the most credible potential entrants to the gas and electricity markets would be excluded and
that the merged company would enjoy a quasi-monopoly in the Portuguese energy market. In particular, the Commission wanted guarantees that competitors would have access to infrastructure and would not be shut out of the market. EdP complained that the Commission had insisted it give up its only gas-fired power station in Portugal - which it was not prepared to do (see issue 2919).
Domestic markets.

Portugal's electricity market has only been recently liberalised and the gas market is due to be slowly opened up. Mrs Kroes said ensuring effective competition in newly-liberalised markets such as energy was one of her priorities. The Commission could not allow companies to club together to neutralise the effects of new market access, she said. "It would have undermined the benefits of energy liberalisation, and excluded new entrants from the Portuguese markets. It would have meant higher prices for retail and business customers and put Portuguese industry at a competitive disadvantage."

An economic analysis of the merger concluded that the transaction would strengthen EdP’s dominant position in the electricity wholesale and retail markets in Portugal and knock out GdP’s potential to compete in the electricity markets. The effects would be long-lasting: current and possible future power producers in Portugal would be

Page 108 of 117 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
dependent on their main competitor, EdP. Meanwhile, GdP's leading role in the Portuguese gas markets would be strengthened as it mop up a large part of the gas demand - EdP's share - and lose EdP as the most likely entrant into the gas market.
Looking beyond Portugal.

EdP insisted that the Commission should look at the entire Iberian energy market (both Spain and Portugal) instead of focusing on Portugal alone. In EdP's view, this means it would not have a dominant market position and would be only the fifth or sixth largest firm in the region. The Commission disagreed, saying the
interconnection capacity between Spain and Portugal remains inadequate for the EdP/GdP deal to guarantee real competition between power companies in both countries. Plans have been under way for some time to create a single energy market in the region - known as Mibel - but a precise timescale is still unclear.

Mrs Kroes said she did not believe an Iberian electricity market would appear in the near future. "It is highly unlikely (…) many regulatory hurdles have to be removed", she said. But the ruling was not a template for future tie-ups between energy companies. Each merger would be looked at on its own merits: "It depends on what type of companies are in the market (…) and what will be the consequences of the merger in the market", she said.

Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said the deal could not be examined in a pan-European context either. Firms had to face competition at home to be competitive, he said, dismissing arguments that businesses in small countries needed help to be able to compete at the EU level. "Fat and lazy" companies would not be able to penetrate other markets, he said.

Energias de Portugal (EDP) may appeal against the veto of its merger with  Gas de Portugal by the  European     Commission, c.e.o. Joao Talone said on Wednesday. “If our lawyers recommend it we will appeal,” he told a meeting with analysts in London. “But the veto does not affect our strategy. We are looking forward to other ways to develop in both  gas and power in Iberia.” “We cannot say the development is not important but there is no
point in crying over spilt milk. We fought for the merger to the end but we are not prepared to make concessions that jeopardise the value of  EDP,” he said. Last week Portugal’s plan to restructure its state-controlled energy sector was thrown into disarray by the Commission’s decision. Brussels rejected the merger after a four-month inquiry. It said that plans by  EDP to buy 51% of Gas de Portugal and for  Eni of Italy to acquire the rest would create barriers to competition.

“The strengthening of the dominant positions of the existing electricity and gas suppliers would have resulted in higher prices for Portuguese consumers and industrial users, and so a loss of competitiveness for the Portuguese economy,” said the Commission. Portugal has said there will be no new proposals on energy policy before the general election early next year. The vote was called last month following the departure of premier José Manuel Barroso to become president of the European Commission. The veto raises questions about EDP’s 2005-2007 strategic plan to maintain a 20% share of the Iberian energy market. It comes on top of the loss of market share expected as a result of liberalization. “Liberalisation means the group will lose share in Portugal,” Talone said.
“But we have gas and electricity interests, especially in Spain, which will expand to maintain out overall share.” Portugal’s gas sector, which consumed 3 billion cubic metres of gas in 2003, is mainly owned by Gas de Portugal. EDP owns 14.5% of Galpenergia, the state-owned holding company that controls the gas group. DM

What's New
Disarray, Opportunity After Portugal  Veto

The European Commission's Dec. 9 formal veto of a proposed takeover of  Gas de Portugal (GdP) by a
51%-49% joint venture of Energias de Portugal (EdP) and Italy's  Eni puts Portugal's domestic energy industry
into considerable disarray, but may leave the way open for encroachments by  Eni on its own.

In her first big takeover veto since taking office last month,  European Union Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "In this specific case, the strengthening of the dominant positions of the existing electricity and  gas suppliers would have resulted in higher prices for Portuguese consumers and industrial users."

GdP has exclusive gas import and wholesale supply rights in Portugal. EdP is Portugal's incumbent electricity supplier and a part-owner of Spain's fourth largest power group Hidrocantabrico. Later this week, EdP expects to complete an outright takeover of Hidrocantabrico and Naturcorp, a gas distributor in northern Spain.

Eni was effectively to have traded its one-third equity stake in Galpenergia for the planned 49% stake in GdP. A planned restructuring of Galpenergia into an oils-only business, also announced in April, is on ice thanks in part to the EU decision on GdP, but also to political inertia ahead of Portugal's scheduled Feb. 20 general election.

Similarly frozen are plans to put GdP's network assets and the Sines LNG terminal into revamped state power grid operator REN. Opened in October 2003, Sines is one of Europe's two closest terminals to growing West African supplies. Portugal consumed only 3.2 billion cubic meters (309 million cubic feet per day) in 2003, but sales are expected to double within a few years (WGI Nov.10,p7).

While acknowledging the veto, EdP last week said it will not "change its strategy for jointly developing the Iberian electricity and gas businesses" and taunted the commission for ignoring its case for the wider benefits of the planned restructuring in a unified market with Spain, in which EdP is roughly the sixth-largest supplier.

Kroes argued back that a properly integrated Iberian power market is a long way off, and she was thus obliged to focus on Portugal only. Her reputation for toughness and independence will be enhanced as her boss, new European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, was prime minister of Portugal early in 2004 when the GdP and Galpenergia deals were hatched. He abstained from last week's GdP decision.

Eni has a 50-50 joint venture with Spain's third largest power group Union Fenosa that has interests in Egyptian and Oman LNG ventures (WGI Dec.8,p1). And it supplies 2 Bcm/yr of gas to Iberdrola (WGI Feb.11,p4).

Eni hasn't commented on the GdP veto, but it's worth noting that the commission argued mainly on the basis of EdP's dominance, rather than Eni's size in the Iberian or Portuguese markets. The implication is that if Eni pursued a direct strategy, rather than riding the coattails of Iberian power incumbents, it might get further.

Energias de Portugal  Sees Div Rise, EUR6B Invest By '07

LISBON (Dow Jones)--Energias de Portugal SA (EDP) aims to boost its operating margin 6.5% over the next three years, boost EBITDA 35% and increase its dividend payout by 7% or 8% annually through 2007, the company said Tuesday.

EDP is giving a presentation to investors in London. It comes a week after the  European Union Commission blocked EDP's plan to absorb Portuguese natural  gas monopoly Gas de Portugal SA, in conjunction with Italy's Eni SpA (E).

The company said its three-year plan is based on three pillars: improving its competitive position in Iberia, better controlling costs and improving service in the electricity distribution unit, and maximizing the economic value of its international and non-core operations.

In Iberia, integrating Spanish generator Hidrocantabric will create synergies and a more efficient management structure, while ending term contracts for electricity with the national grid, REN, will have a neutral impact on EDP's bottom line.

EDP will also focus on adding generating capacity with new hydroelectric plants and combined cycle generators on the Iberian peninsula.

All of these investments and preparations are driven in part by the company's strategy for the unified Iberian electricity market, MIBEL, which is due to be operational in 2005.

In Brazil, EDP will continue to grow its local operations and hopes to list its Brazil unit on the Bovespa stock exchange once it reaches a point where the cashflow from the Brazilian operations is enough to sustain the company.
EDP also hopes to improve the profitability of its Oni telecoms unit in Portugal, and to continue divesting its IT
operations.

The three-year plan indicates a total investment of EUR6 billion, of which 80% will go to maintaining and expanding EDP's generating assets in Portugal and Spain. Some 27% of the expected investment will be in renewable energy sources.

European Commision rejects Portugal’s energy sector revamp

Portugal’s plans to restructure its state-controlled energy sector to create a national champion have collapsed in disarray following a formal veto from the  European Commission. This month, the Commission rejected the merger of Portugal’s largest company and incumbent electricity supplier, Energias de Portugal (EDP), with Gas de Portugal, which owns most of the country’s gas assets on the grounds that plans by  EDP to buy 51% and for Eni of Italy to acquire the remaining 49% of Gas de Portugal would create barriers to competition. “Ensuring effective competition in newly liberalised markets such as energy is a priority for me,” said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

“The strengthening of the dominant positions of the existing electricity and gas suppliers would have resulted in higher prices for Portuguese consumers and industrial users, and so a loss of competitiveness for the Portuguese economy.” The Commission’s main concern with the merger appears to have been with the dominance of EDP, and it may be that a more direct approach by Eni (which originally was due to trade its third share in Galpenergias as part of the deal) would prove more successful. Brussels’ first merger prohibition in three years ends a
four-month inquiry and lengthy negotiations with EDP and the Portuguese government. In talks since August EDP made several concessions but negotiations broke down over Brussels’ insistence that the company sell off the new Ter 800 MW CCGT. EDP, which had agreed to sell the new Sines LNG terminal, refused, according to banking sources in Lisbon. The setback means more delays in settling the future of the energy sector because since the talks began elections have been called for early next year. If the Socialist party replaces the Social Democrats the policy may change, say analysts. “There is a feeling in Portugal that EDP had made enough
concessions and that the EU was being inflexible,” said an analyst. “This is bad for the group as the merger would have made it a more viable player in the single Iberian energy market.” The European Commission is thought to see Portugal’s attempt to merge most of its gas and power assets as a dangerous precedent for other countries, such as Spain and France. It said a single Iberian energy market would take years to develop and rejected the argument that EDP needed to be larger to compete with larger Spanish power and gas companies. The Commission said the union of two dominant state-controlled energy firms would reinforce EDP’s dominant
position in Portugal’s wholesale and retail electricity markets, and make Gas de Portugal an overly dominant player on its national gas market. Energias de Portugal (EDP) may appeal against the veto of its merger with Gas de Portugal by the European Commission, c.e.o. Joao Talone said. “We fought for the merger to the end but we are not prepared to make concessions that jeopardise the value of EDP,” he said. Portugal has said there will be no new proposals on energy policy before the general election early next year. The vote was called last month following the departure of premier José Manuel Barroso to become president of the European Commission. The veto raises questions about EDP’s 2005-2007 strategic plan to maintain a 20% share of the Iberian energy market. It comes on top of the loss of market share expected as a result of liberalisation. “Liberalisation means
the group will lose share in Portugal,” Talone said. “But we have gas and electricity interests, especially in Spain, which will expand to maintain out overall share.” Portugal’s gas sector, which consumed 3 Gm3 in 2003, is mainly owned by Gas de Portugal. EDP owns 14.5% of Galpenergia, the state-owned holding company that controls the gas group.

EC rejects EDP/Eni's take-over of Gas de Portugal

The European Commission has given the thumbs down to a proposal by Energias de Portugal and Italy's  Eni to buy Gas de Portugal. "This merger would have been bad for Portuguese consumers, bad for the competitiveness of Portuguese industry, would have undermined the benefits of the internal energy market in Portugal and excluded new entrants," European Union competition commissioner Neelie Kroes told journalists in Brussels. Portugal's electricity incumbent EDP and Italy's  gas incumbent Eni had negotiated a deal to buy Portugal's  gas incumbent GDP for €1.2 billion. But the  EC was concerned about the effect on energy market competition in Portugal and the remedies proposed by the companies failed to overcome these concerns, said Kroes. The  EC could not accept "a quasi-monopoly for an indefinite period in the energy sector in Portugal," she said.

The EC wanted to see evidence of real competition in the market, she said, for example that competitors were active and could use the incumbents' infrastructure.

Kroes said it had not been an easy case, but the decision was based on "a very thorough investigation" and in-depth economic analysis: "Securing better competition in new markets like energy is a priority for me," she said.

EDP, which has interests in the Spanish energy market, had called on the EC to consider the deal in the context of the wider Iberian market, as it no longer considers itself a purely Portuguese company. But Kroes said: "The investigation clearly shows that the market will not become Iberian in scope in the near future." Decisions on future energy company mergers would depend on the real level of competition in their markets. Neither the EC nor the competition authorities had ever allowed gas and electricity incumbents to merge since market opening, she said. It was important "to prevent companies clubbing together to neutralize the effects of new market access." And the EC had to ensure that consumers benefited from lower prices and more supplier choice after mergers, she said.

Energias de Portugal's distribution arm is expected to achieve €1.17 billion in revenues from regulated activities next year as a result of the new tariff structure set by energy regulator ERSE, the Portuguese utility said on December 6. The amount, which should provide an 8.5% return on net assets for EdP Distribuicao, is 0.3% less than the allowed revenues for 2004, when a 9% rate of return was set.

EdP noted that revenue allowance was not based on its real cost base, but that it would continue to implement measures aimed at improving efficiency and reducing costs so as to reach the 8.5% target.

ERSE set end-user power rates for 2005 on December 3 that would result in an average increase of 3.6%. Specifically, very high voltage prices are to drop 4.1%, while high voltage prices are to rise 2%, medium voltage prices by 3.3%, special low voltage by 3.7%, normal low voltage by between 2.8% and 4.8% and public lighting by 2.3%.

Vittorio Mincato told Portugal's economy minister Alvaro Barreto in Lisbon on Dec. 22.
Earlier this month, the  European Commission barred Electricidade de Portugal (Edp) and Eni from buying Gas
de Portugal (Gdp) on competition grounds, but  Edp said it would stick to the plan (see SN n° 46, 2004, p. 3).

A source close to negotiations over the problem told “Reuters” a possible solution could involve Eni agreeing to put back the start date of an option it holds to buy a controlling stake in the state-controlled Galpenergia, which owns Gdp. “One of the possibilities on the table would see Eni agreeing to delay the call option on Galpenergia until after Portugal's elections in March,” the source said.

Under the terms of the agreement struck with Edp earlier this year, Edp and Eni planned to buy 51% and 49% respectively of Gdp from Galpenergia. If the deal failed to go forward, Eni has the right to buy a controlling share of Galpenergia in February 2005. Eni already owns 33.34% of Galp.
Barreto said earlier this month that the current government would never accept Eni taking control of Galpenergia.

Energias de Portugal (EDP) has bought stakes in two local  gas distribution companies with 217,000 customers and sales of 2,267 GWh per year. The group will have a 10.11% share in Setgas and 59.55% in Portgas after exercising EUR 153.3 million in options, the power company said. The step is part of EDP’s strategy to increase its stake in the Iberian  gas market despite the setback last month when the European Commission rejected a merger with Gas de Portugal, which owns most of the country’s  gas assets. Portugal consumed about 3 billion cubic metres of gas this year. EDP, Portugal’s biggest industrial group, said it would control Portgas with Spanish
power company Endesa and Gaz de France. This week the group said it expects to be paid about EUR 3 billion in compensation for the early termination of its long-term power purchase agreements (PPA).

The estimate is based on a law published on Monday to phase out the PPAs, which allow most power to be sold under long-term contracts on a cost-plus arrangement, to make way for liberalisation. DM
