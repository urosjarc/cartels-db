"WIND TELECOMUNICAZIONI" JOINT-VENTURE INTRODUCES A NEW SUPPLIER OF A COMPLETE RANGE OF TELECOMS SERVICES IN ITALY, INCREASING COMPETITION.

Brussels, 24/06/1998 (Agence  Europe) - As EUROPE mentioned briefly yesterday (p.9), the  European                Commission has authorized the creation of a full-function cooperative joint-venture, "Wind Telecomunicazioni" with as goal to supply a complete range of telecommunications services in Italy. It has been created by three giants: Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and the Italian electricity group ENEL which has a telecommunications network so far used for its own purposes. In future, this network will be extended and improved and used by the joint-venture; thus there will be a new operator in Italy with its own network.
The Commission took a favourable decision, taking account of the following elements:
a) Wind will not lead to a dominant position on the market for the resale of transmission

capacity. It needs to be considered that, so far, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom have not been active on the Italian telecommunications market (except for a limited presence for enhanced services);
b) Wind's parent companies do not generally cooperate amongst themselves;

c) the positive decision regarding Wind under the "merger" regulation, in no way prejudices the ongoing separate investigation, under the regulation on concerted agreements, regarding overall cooperation between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.
A note from the spokesperson provides the following indications regarding the new joint-venture:

"Wind will offer a full range of domestic and international telecommunications services to business and residential customers located in Italy, combining mobile and fixed line telecommunications activities. Wind is already
licensed to install public fixed telecommunications networks to provide fixed line telecommunications services, to resell capacity and to provide packet switched data transmission. It has recently been selected as licensee for the provision of mobile telephony services using the DCS 1800 technology.

Wind will be a new entrant on the markets for domestic and international voice and data telecommunications services, mobile telephony and enhanced services in Italy".
Italian sources say that ENEL will hold a majority stake in Wind (51%), with Deutsche Telekom and France
Telecom sharing the remaining 49%.
