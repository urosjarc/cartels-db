Ryanair to Appeal Aer Lingus  Takeover Decision

Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY) on Tuesday said it would appeal an expected decision by  European regulators to block its takeover of Irish carrier  Aer Lingus  PLC (EIL1.DB), despite offering "unprecedented" remedies to maintain competition on Irish routes.

The discount airline said it had been notified by the European Commission that the regulator intended to block the 694 million euro ($930.3 million) takeover--Ryanair's third attempt at a merger--during a meeting ahead of a March 6 deadline for a decision.

"It appears clear from this morning's meeting, that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair said, adding that it will appeal the decision in European courts.

Ryanair currently holds 29.8% in Aer Lingus. The Irish government, which has a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, opposed the bid.

The news comes just 10 days after Ryanair submitted the latest in a string of concession packages to secure approval to acquire Aer Lingus, after the Commission--the European Union's regulatory arm--signaled that remedies proposed earlier were insufficient.

In the latest package, regional carrier Flybe Group PLC (FLYB.LN) would have taken over 43 Aer Lingus routes, guaranteeing EUR20 million in annual profit as well as a EUR100 million upfront payment for Flybe. The aim was to convince the Commission that Flybe was a credible competitor to Ryanair despite issuing several profit warnings over the past two years and cuts to its U.K. workforce, announced last month.

Ryanair had also proposed to transfer all of Aer Lingus's routes between London Gatwick and Ireland to British Airways, a unit of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (ICAGY), or IAG. Under the previous package, British Airways would instead have received the routes between London Heathrow and Ireland.

"Given Ryanair's remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU's statement of objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules," said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely. "Ryanair has no alternative but to appeal any prohibition decision."
But others have noted the difference between the business models operated by Flybe and the two Irish airlines. "How can Flybe compete with Ryanair? It's impossible. It's the classic motivation of the corporate raider," Aer
Lingus Chief Executive Christoph Mueller said in an interview last week. "You can manipulate any marketplace
with artificial competitors. Ryanair would even write the business plan for Flybe--this is very, very flawed," Mr.
Mueller added.

Aer Lingus on Tuesday said it hadn't been notified of any decision from the commission and that it intends to oppose Ryanair's offer for the company.

Ryanair and rival low-cost airline easyJet PLC (ESYJY) have ramped up pressure on national carriers already squeezed by high fuel costs and a sluggish economy.


Page 5 of 121 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Earlier on Tuesday, IAG said its Spanish unit Iberia had started the formal process of collective redundancy for over 3,807 jobs, as part of its plans to cut capacity by 15%. And Deutsche Lufthansa AG (DLAKY), Europe's biggest airline by passengers; smaller German rival Air Berlin PLC (AB1.XE); and Air France, owned by Air France-KLM SA (AF.FR), are all reorganizing their operations to stem losses.

LONDON--Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY) on Tuesday said it would appeal an expected decision by  European regulators to block its takeover of Irish carrier  Aer Lingus  PLC (EIL1.DB), despite offering "unprecedented" remedies to maintain competition on Irish routes.
The discount airline said it had been notified by the European Commission that the regulator intended to block the

RYANAIR ADMITS DEFEAT ON BUYOUT BID

Ryanair has admitted defeat in its renewed takeover bid for rival  Aer Lingus,  but vowed to fight the decision in the courts.

The low-cost carrier said it had been notified by the  European Commission that the 694 million euro (£596.7 million) buyout plan would be rejected.
Ryanair claimed European chiefs were holding it to much higher standards than any other EU airline.

"It appears clear from this morning's meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said.
mfl
Ryanair said it was told of the decision at a state of play meeting with the EU Commission this morning.

The takeover plan - a third bid by Michael O'Leary for Aer Lingus - appeared to have been boosted last week when Flybe agreed a plan to fly 43 of Aer Lingus' short-haul routes, easing competition concerns.

There had also been a commitment from the IAG airline group to run overlapping Aer Lingus/Ryanair routes between Dublin and London Gatwick to ensure competition.
Mr Kiely said: "Given Ryanair's remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU's Statement of
Objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules.

"This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish Government and is not based on competition law."
Ryanair has instructed lawyers to appeal the refusal to the European courts. mfl
Aer Lingus said it was in a much stronger position now than at the time of the first takeover bid in 2007.

"The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger in this instance than with the previous offers. Therefore, it was and remains Aer Lingus' position that the offer should never have been made," a spokesman said.
Aer Lingus said it has not received notification from the Commission of the decision. mfl
Leo Varadkar, Irish Transport Minister, said the Ryanair offer did not come up to the required standards to ease concerns over competition.

"I note the Ryanair statement. As I have stated before, the Ryanair remedies package as reported has not satisfied the Government's concerns about connectivity, competition or employment," Mr Varadkar said.
"I do not wish to make further comment until the European Commission has formally made its decision."

Page 9 of 121 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Irish Government retained a 25% stake in Aer Lingus after its privatisation in 2006.

The former flag carrier was hit by Ryanair's first takeover challenge a year after the floatation but Aer Lingus now maintains its rival is its only significant competitor on most routes in and out of Ireland.
Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus was prohibited in 2007 on competition grounds.

Aer Lingus, which last week posted strong 2012 results with operating profit up 41% to 69.1 million euro (£59m), said it would continue to assist a UK Competition Commission (UKCC) investigation into Ryanair's shareholding.

"Ryanair has on a number of occasions attempted to halt this separate UKCC investigation, including by means of its third hostile takeover offer," Aer Lingus said.
"Aer Lingus now looks forward to the conclusion of the UKCC investigation. As indicated previously it is Aer
Lingus' position that Ryanair, as our largest competitor should be required to divest its shareholding."

Brussels to block Ryanair's  third tilt at Aer Lingus; Ryanair has accused the European Commission of not
giving  it a “fair  hearing" after competition officials signalled they would block the airline’s proposed takeover of rival Aer Lingus.

The low cost carrier said it was told at a “state of play" meeting with  European competition officials on Tuesday morning that they intended to prohibit  Ryanair’s latest €694m (£597m) tilt at its Irish rival.

The decision will mark the third time in seven years Michael O’Leary,  Ryanair’s outspoken chief executive, has failed to secure a takeover of  Aer Lingus.

While the EC is yet to publish an official ruling, Ryanair said it had already instructed its lawyers to build the case for an appeal.

The low cost airline had secured a commitment from Flybe, the loss-making UK carrier, to operate 43 Aer Lingus routes between Ireland and Europe, where the EC was concerned Ryanair would have a monopoly.

British Airways-owner International Airlines Group had also agreed to take on Aer Lingus’s flights between Ireland and Gatwick in the event of a takeover receiving EC approval.

Ryanair claimed it was being held to a “much higher standard" than other airlines by the EC as its agreements with Flybe and IAG addressed competition concerns.

“It appears clear…that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," said Ryanair’s spokesman Robin Kiely.

“Given Ryanair’s remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU’s statement of objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules."

Antoine Colombani, the EC's spokesman for competition, said: "The Commission will take a decision in this case at the end of February or the beginning of March."

Antoine Colombani, the EC's spokesman for competition, said: "The Commission will take a decision in this case at the end of February or the beginning of March."

Aer Lingus said it had not received any notification from the EC that it intended to block the takeover attempt but the carrier added: "it was and remains Aer Lingus’ position that the offer should never have been made."

EU Commission looks set to reject  Ryanair's latest bid for  Aer Lingus

The EU Commission looks set to reject Ryanair's latest bid for Aer Lingus, according to a press release from the low-cost carrier. In a statement Ryanair said that it has been "notified this morning (February 12) at a State of
Play meeting with the EU Commission, that the EU Commission intends to prohibit Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus, despite the fact that Ryanair has met every competition concern raised in the EU's Statement of Objections and during the review process, including providing the EU Ð at its request Ð with irrevocable commitments from not one, but two, upfront buyers to eliminate all competitive overlaps between Ryanair and Aer Lingus" The carrier says that BA's owner IAG has committed to "take over divestments of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus' entire
London-Gatwick operations", while Flybe has committed to take over 43 Aer Lingus UK and European routes (see online news February 6). The European Commission is expected to give its decision on Ryanair's latest bid for
Aer Lingus on March 6, and the carrier says it has "instructed its lawyers to appeal any prohibition decision to the
European Courts". Tue, Feb 12, 2013 AirGuideBusiness ISSN 1939-666X

Irish no-frills airline Ryanair said on Tuesday that the  European Commission intended to block its takeover bid for rival carrier Aer Lingus  on grounds of unfair competition and that it would appeal against the decision.

"Ryanair...was notified this (Tuesday) morning at a state-of-play meeting with the EU Commission, that the  EU Commission intends to prohibit Ryanair's offer for  Aer Lingus,  despite the fact that Ryanair has met every competition concern raised in the EU's statement of objections and during the review process," a statement said.

Ryanair said last month that it had submitted "a radical and unprecedented remedies package to the EU in support of its offer for Aer Lingus."

Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said in a statement: "It appears clear from this morning's meeting, that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited
regardless of competition rules."

He said: "This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law."
Ryanair owns 30 percent of Aer Lingus and offered last July to buy the Irish government's stake in the airline, but
Dublin has stood firm and last month formally announced that it would not sell.
The Irish government owns 25.1 percent of Aer Lingus -- not enough alone to block Ryanair's offer, while the
European Commission is concerned that a takeover would diminish competition for Irish consumers.
The Commission blocked an earlier Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus in 2006, arguing that it would harm competition. Recent media reports said Ryanair had offered to offload more than a third of Aer Lingus' short-haul operations to
secure the takeover.
The Financial Times had said that Ryanair would dispose of 23 routes where a takeover would create a monopoly
-- to British rival low-cost airline Flybe.
The business daily added that Ryanair had proposed to give British Airways the right to purchase about half of
Aer Lingus' slots at London Heathrow airport that are used to fly services to Ireland.

"For the first time in EU airline history, Ryanair delivered not one, but two, substantial upfront EU airline buyers who have agreed to come to Ireland to compete against a combined Ryanair/Aer Lingus," Ryanair added on Tuesday.

Irish no-frills airline  Ryanair said Tuesday that the  European Commission would block its takeover bid for rival carrier Aer Lingus  on grounds of unfair competition, adding it would appeal against the decision.

"Ryanair...was notified this (Tuesday) morning at a state-of-play meeting with the EU Commission, that the  EU Commission intends to prohibit Ryanair's offer for  Aer Lingus,  despite the fact that Ryanair has met every competition concern raised in the EU's statement of objections and during the review process," it said in a statement.
Aer Lingus added separately that it had not received any official notification but argued that the Ryanair bid
should never have been made. It added that Ryanair's first attempt was also prohibited on competition grounds in
2007.

"Aer Lingus is a much stronger airline today than it was at the time of the previous Ryanair offers and is Ryanair's only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes," it said.
Ryanair had revealed last month that it had submitted "a radical and unprecedented remedies package to the EU
in support of its offer for Aer Lingus."

"It appears clear from this morning's meeting, that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said.

"This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law," he added.
Ryanair owns 30 percent of Aer Lingus and last July offered to buy the Irish government's stake in the airline, but
Dublin has stood firm and last month formally announced that it would not sell.

The Irish government owns 25.1 percent of Aer Lingus -- not enough to single-handedly block Ryanair's offer, while the European Commission fears that a takeover would diminish competition for Irish consumers.

Recent media reports said Ryanair had offered to offload more than a third of Aer Lingus' short-haul operations to secure the takeover.
The Financial Times had said that Ryanair would dispose of 23 routes where a takeover would create a monopoly
-- to British rival low-cost airline Flybe.
The business daily added that Ryanair had proposed to give British Airways the right to purchase about half of
Aer Lingus' slots at London Heathrow airport that are used to fly services to Ireland.

Flybe had agreed to establish a new Irish subsidiary, Flybe Ireland, with 100 million euros of capital provided by Ryanair to allay concerns that a Ryanair takeover would lead to a monopoly of the Irish aviation industry. "For the first time in EU airline history, Ryanair delivered not one, but two, substantial upfront EU airline buyers who have agreed to come to Ireland to compete against a combined Ryanair/Aer Lingus," Ryanair added in Tuesday's statement.
Ireland's transport minister Leo Varadkar reiterated Dublin's opposition to the takeover earlier on Tuesday.

"As I have stated before, the Ryanair remedies package as reported has not satisfied the Government's concerns about connectivity, competition or employment," he added in a statement.
"I do not wish to make further comment until the European Commission has formally made its decision."

In early afternoon deals on the Dublin stock market, Aer Lingus shares fell by 4.33 percent to 1.28 euros. Ryanair shares were relatively unchanged at 5.65 euros.

An EC spokesman said the commission will take its decision at the end of the month or early March. Last month, the EC extended the deadline on its decision until March 6.

REFILE-UPDATE 2-Ryanair says Aer Lingus  bid blocked  by regulator

* Ryanair says European Commission indicates it will block deal
* Ryanair says rejection political, plans legal action
* EU says no final decision has been taken
By Conor Humphries

DUBLIN, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Ryanair's bid to take over smaller Irish rival Aer Lingus is to be blocked by Europe's anti-monopoly watchdog, the low-cost giant said on Tuesday, a "political" decision it said it would challenge in court.
The rejection of what Ryanair has described as its third and final bid for its rival, likely marks the end of a
long-held ambition of Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary to seize control of the country's 75-year-old former
flag carrier.

The European Commission, which acts as the European Union's competition authority, told Ryanair executives at a meeting on Tuesday morning that it intends to block the bid, Ryanair said in a statement.
A Commission spokesman said a final decision had not yet been taken.

"It appears clear from this morning's meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said in a statement following a meeting with Commission representatives.

"This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law," he said.
Aer Lingus said it had not been informed of any decision, but said it had always expected a rejection.
"It was and remains Aer Lingus's position that the offer should never have been made," it said in a statement. LAST CHANCE
Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, was told last month that it had one last chance to submit measures to ensure the proposed 694 million-euro ($928 million) merger did not reduce competition.

Ryanair's latest offer to the Commission included ceding 43 routes to a newly created Irish subsidiary of British airline Flybe and hand to British Airways the routes Aer Lingus operates from London's Gatwick Airport.

The commission's principle objection was over the viability of the envisaged new carrier Flybe Ireland and whether British Airways would continue the routes after an initial three-year period, a source close to the talks said.
Flybe said in a statement it was disappointed by the news and was awaiting the result of Ryanair's appeal.

"The Commission will take a decision in this case at the end of February or the beginning of March," said a spokesman for EU competition chief Joaquin Almunia, who declined to comment further on the Ryanair statement.

Ryanair said the Commission was influenced by the Irish government, which has publicly criticised the merger, saying it could damage access between Ireland and major European airports and undermine competition.

The acquisition of Aer Lingus has long been seen as a personal ambition of O'Leary's, capping his transformation of an airline that started with one plane in 1985 into one of Europe's largest with over 300.
Aer Lingus operates 45 aircraft.

The Commission blocked Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus in 2007 and Ryanair dropped its second in 2009.

Ryanair's offer of concessions went further in its latest bid than it had before, but failed to win over Irish political or public opinion.

"People are happy with the status quo, they have a soft spot for Aer Lingus," said Cathay Daly, a financial services professional walking in central Dublin.
"People were happy Ryanair brought some competition to Ireland but they don't want them to take it out."
Aer Lingus's shares were 4 percent lower at 1.28 euros by 1455 GMT, when Ryanair's shares were unchanged at
5.67 euros. ($1 = 0.7474 euros)

EC to ban Ryanair's  third attempt to buy out Aer Lingus
251 words
12 February 2013

12 February 2013 – The  European Commission (EC) has notified Irish airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (LON:RYA) of its intention to block the latter’s planned buyout of smaller competitor Aer Lingus  Group Plc (LON:AERL), Ryanair announced in a statement today.

The low-cost carrier, which believes that the remedies package it offered in connection with the proposed tie-up is “unprecedented”, said it would appeal any prohibition decision to the  European Courts. According to  Ryanair's Robin Kiely, the  EC’s decision to ban the planned transaction is clearly a political one and is not based on competition law.

Earlier, Ryanair provided the commission with a package of concessions that envisages the purchase of the two companies’ entire London-Gatwick operations by International Airlines Group (LON:IAG) as well as the transfer of
43 Aer Lingus UK and European routes to Flybe Group Plc (LON:FLYB).

Ryanair is offering a price of EUR1.30 (USD1.75) per share to buy the 70% it does not already own in Aer Lingus, thus valuing the company at EUR694m. This is its third attempt to take full control of its rival after European Union (EU) regulators blocked its efforts twice in the previous years.
Status: Bidding Type group: Type: Corporate acquisition Buyer: Ryanair Holdings Plc
Comment: The bid values Aer Lingus at USD933m. Country: Ireland
Sector: Air Transport
Target: Aer Lingus Group Plc

Ryanair To Appeal Any EU Prohibition
603 words
12 February 2013
M2 Presswire
MTPW
English
© 2013, M2 Communications. All rights reserved.
Ryanair, Europes favourite airline, was notified this morning (12 Feb) at a State of Play meeting with the  EU Commission, that the  EU Commission intends to prohibit Ryanairs offer for  Aer Lingus,  despite the fact that Ryanair has met every competition concern raised in the EUs Statement of Objections and during the review process, including providing the  EU at its request with irrevocable commitments from not one, but two, upfront buyers to eliminate all competitive overlaps between Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  IAG has committed that they would take over divestments of Ryanairs and Aer Lingus  entire London-Gatwick operations, and Flybe has committed to take over 43  Aer Lingus  UK and European routes.

Given that the EU Commission recently approved IAGs acquisition of BMI at London-Heathrow on the basis of three year commitments, the EUs claim that it could not be satisfied of IAGs and Flybes commitments to these Irish routes after three years is another example of the EU holding Ryanair to a much higher standard than any other EU airline. Ryanairs remedies package is unprecedented. For the first time in EU airline history, Ryanair delivered not one, but two, substantial upfront EU airline buyers who have agreed to come to Ireland to compete against a combined Ryanair/Aer Lingus.
Ryanair has today instructed its lawyers to appeal any prohibition decision to the European Courts.

Ryanairs Robin Kiely said: It appears clear from this mornings meeting, that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules.

Given Ryanairs remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EUs Statement of Objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules. Ryanair has no alternative but to appeal any prohibition decision and we expect to get a fair hearing at the European Courts, as we havent received one from Commissioner Almunia and his case team. This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish Government and is not based on competition law.

RYANAIR'S bid for  Aer Lingus  is to be blocked by the  European Commission, the airline says.

"Ryanair...was notified this (Tuesday) morning at a state-of-play meeting with the EU Commission, that the  EU Commission intends to prohibit Ryanair's offer for  Aer Lingus,  despite the fact that Ryanair has met every competition concern raised in the EU's statement of objections and during the review process," a statement said.

Ryanair said last month that it had submitted "a radical and unprecedented remedies package to the EU in support of its offer for Aer Lingus."

Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said in a statement: "It appears clear from this morning's meeting, that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited
regardless of competition rules."

He said: "This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law."
Ryanair owns 30 per cent of Aer Lingus and offered last July to buy the Irish government's stake in the airline, but
Dublin has stood firm and last month formally announced that it would not sell.
The Irish government owns 25.1 per cent of Aer Lingus - not enough alone to block Ryanair's offer, while the
European Commission is concerned that a takeover would diminish competition for Irish consumers.
The Commission blocked an earlier Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus in 2006, arguing that it would harm competition. Recent media reports said Ryanair had offered to offload more than a third of Aer Lingus' short-haul operations to
secure the takeover.
The Financial Times had said that Ryanair would dispose of 23 routes where a takeover would create a monopoly
- to British rival low-cost airline Flybe.
The business daily added that Ryanair had proposed to give British Airways the right to purchase about half of
Aer Lingus' slots at London Heathrow airport that are used to fly services to Ireland.

"For the first time in EU airline history, Ryanair delivered not one, but two, substantial upfront EU airline buyers who have agreed to come to Ireland to compete against a combined Ryanair/Aer Lingus," Ryanair added on Tuesday.

Ryanair says EC set to veto its takeover of Aer Lingus

THE European Commission (EC) is set to block  Ryanair's planned takeover of  Aer Lingus,  the Irish budget airline said today.

Ryanair said it was told by the R  EC that it "intends to prohibit" the €694 million (£590 million) merger between the two Irish airlines. If so, it would be the second time Brussels has vetoed the takeover and the third time Ryanair, headed by Michael O'Leary, pictured, will have failed with a move for its rival. The  EC blocked a deal in
2007 while Ryanair dropped its second attempt in 2009 after opposition from the Irish government, whicowns
25% of Aer Lingus.

Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely claimed the move was "clearly a political one", saying it had offered remedies that "clearly addresses every issue raised" by the EC.
Concessions proposed include paying Flybe to take over a number of Aer Lingus' routes.
The EC said that a final decision would not be made until the end of this month or the start of March. Ryanair said that it would appeal to the European courts against a veto.

Ryanair Indicates  Regulators Will Reject Aer Lingus  Deal

Ryanair, the discount  European airline, is preparing for a fight with regulators over its deal to buy  Aer Lingus.

On Tuesday,  Ryanair said the European Commission "intends to prohibit" its offer for  Aer Lingus,  despite the airline's attempts to appease antitrust concerns.  Ryanair added that it planned to appeal the decision.

"It appears clear from this morning's meeting, that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and we're going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Robin Kiely, head of communications for the airline, said in a statement.
The deal has been troubled from the start.

Ryanairmoved to buyAer Lingus last summer, offering 694 million euros ($931 million) in its third attempt to buy the Irish carrier. Management trumpeted the opportunities, saying the deal would create "one strong Irish airline group capable of competing with Europe's other major airline groups."

But the board of Aer Lingusimmediately rejected the hostile takeover bid, saying it undervalued the airline and would raise antitrust concerns. Ryanair's first bid to buy Aer Lingus in 2007 was blocked for antitrust reasons.

Since then, Ryanair has sought to assuage concerns about competition, lining up buyers for various operations and routes.

Even so, regulators notified Ryanair on Tuesday that they would block the deal. Ryanair now says it has instructed its lawyers to "appeal any prohibition decision" to the courts.

"This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law," Ryanair said in a statement.

Aer Lingus supported the regulatory decision, saying it was "a much stronger airline today than it was at the time of the previous Ryanair offers" and that it was the only rival to Ryanair on a large number of routes.

"The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger in this instance than with the previous offers," Aer Lingus said in a statement. "Therefore, it was and remains Aer Lingus' position that the offer should never have been made."

The EU Commission looks set to reject Ryanair's latest bid for Aer Lingus, according to a press release from the low-cost carrier. In a statement Ryanair said that it has been "notified this morning (February 12) at a State of
Play meeting with the EU Commission, that the EU Commission intends to prohibit Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus, despite the fact that Ryanair has met every competition concern raised in the EU's Statement of Objections and during the review process, including providing the EU Ð at its request Ð with irrevocable commitments from not one, but two, upfront buyers to eliminate all competitive overlaps between Ryanair and Aer Lingus" The carrier says that BA's owner IAG has committed to "take over divestments of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus' entire
London-Gatwick operations", while Flybe has committed to take over 43 Aer Lingus UK and European routes (see online news February 6). The European Commission is expected to give its decision on Ryanair's latest bid for
Aer Lingus on March 6, and the carrier says it has "instructed its lawyers to appeal any prohibition decision to the

Concerns  over bid for Aer Lingus

Chambers Ireland has urged the  European Commission to reject  Ryanair’s takeover proposal for  Aer Lingus, saying the €694m deal would be anti-competitive and bad for Irish business.
In a submission to the commission, Chambers raised particular concerns over the future ease of access to
Heathrow for Irish business travellers.

"Heathrow is a vital hub for Irish business, offering connectivity to key destinations across the globe. A Ryanair takeover raises major concerns regarding the future of these vital slots and long term access for Irish business users," Seán Murphy, Chambers Ireland air transport users’ council spokesperson said.
Chambers chief executive Ian Talbot added that choice of service providers was vital in any industry.

In December, the Government rejected Ryanair’s initial plans as not being in the best interest of competition, connectivity and employment for Ireland.

Chambers’ statement coincided with news that Aer Arann has extended its franchise agreement with Aer Lingus for another 10 years.

As part of what it calls "a new beginning", the regional carrier also said that it will be expanding existing routes, while a restructuring has put the airline on "a strong financial footing".

Aer Arann has been operating Aer Lingus’s regional routes to secondary British airports since early 2010 and ceased flying under its own name last year. During 2012, regional passenger numbers increased by 32%, with total passenger levels rising by 16% over the past two years. The agreement to operate the Aer Lingus regional service will now continue to the end of 2022. However, Aer Arann refused to comment on how that may be affected were Ryanair to succeed in its takeover of Aer Lingus next month and enter a deal with British carrier, FlyBe.

Yesterday’s announcement also heralded an expansion of Aer Arann’s existing services to Edinburgh and Glasgow and the creation of two new routes from Ireland to Manchester and Birmingham. The new routes will boost Aer Arann’s passengers by 300,000 and bring to 24 the number of routes on its network. A fleet renewal programme will also see Aer Arann take delivery of eight new ATR 72-600 aircraft.
Management aims to double passenger numbers to more than two million within the next five years. Document IRISEX0020130212e92c00018

Aer Lingus  have released a strong statement which says  Ryanair should never have launched a takeover bid for the airline.
The carrier was commenting after the  EU blocked Ryanair's bid earlier.
The budget airline has described the decision as a "political one", which isn't based on competition law. Ryanair bosses have now instructed company lawyers to appeal the block.
Aer Lingus meanwhile says it is looking forward to continuing to assist the UK Competition Commission in its ongoing investigation into the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair’s minority shareholding.

The group is making a submission to the  European Commission today, highlighting the negative impacts of a possible Ryanair-Aer Lingus  merger on Irish businesses.

Chambers Ireland chief executive Ian Talbot said: “Any merger between Ryanair and Aer Lingus would be anti-competitive and bad for Irish business.”

The chambers’ submission to the European Commission comes as Aer Arann announced yesterday it will extend its franchise agreement with Aer Lingus until 2022, adding two new routes to its network this summer.

The European Commission intends to block  Ryanair's planned purchase of  Aer Lingus,  according to a  Ryanair
statement. Ryanair said it would appeal such a move.

Ryanair claimed to have "met every competition concern raised" during the review process, "including providing the European Union — at its request — with irrevocable commitments from not one, but two upfront buyers to eliminate all competitive overlaps between  Ryanair and Aer Lingus,"  a proposed remedy that it called "unprecedented."

Those buyers, according to Ryanair, are IAG, parent of British Airways and Iberia, which agreed to acquire all of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus' London Gatwick operations, and Flybe, which would assume control over 43 Aer Lingus routes.

"It appears clear ... that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," according to a statement attributed to Ryanair head of communications Robin Kiely. "Ryanair has no alternative but to appeal any prohibition decision."

The discount airline said it had been notified by the European Commission that the regulator intended to block the €694 million ($930.3 million) takeover—Ryanair's third attempt at a merger—during a meeting ahead of a March 6 deadline for a decision.

"It appears clear from this morning's meeting, that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair said, adding that it will appeal the decision in European courts.

Ryanair currently holds 29.8% in Aer Lingus. The Irish government, which has a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, opposed the bid.

The news comes just 10 days after Ryanair submitted the latest in a string of concession packages to secure approval to acquire Aer Lingus, after the commission—the European Union's regulatory arm—signaled that remedies proposed earlier were insufficient.

In the latest package, regional carrier Flybe Group PLC would have taken over 43 Aer Lingus routes, guaranteeing €20 million in annual profit as well as a €100 million upfront payment for Flybe. The aim was to convince the commission that Flybe was a credible competitor to Ryanair despite issuing several profit warnings over the past two years and cuts to its U.K. workforce, announced last month.

Ryanair had also proposed to transfer all of Aer Lingus's routes between London Gatwick and Ireland to British Airways, a unit of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, or IAG. Under the previous package, British Airways would instead have received the routes between London Heathrow and Ireland.

"Given Ryanair's remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU's statement of objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules," said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely. "Ryanair has no alternative but to appeal any prohibition decision."
But others have noted the contrasting business models operated by Flybe and the two Irish airlines.

"How can Flybe compete with Ryanair? It's impossible. It's the classic motivation of the corporate raider," Aer Lingus Chief Executive Christoph Mueller said in an interview last week. "You can manipulate any marketplace with artificial competitors. Ryanair would even write the business plan for Flybe—this is very, very flawed," Mr. Mueller added.

Aer Lingus on Tuesday said it hadn't been notified of any decision from the commission and that it intends to oppose Ryanair's offer for the company.

Ryanair and rival low-cost airline easyJet PLC have ramped up pressure on national carriers already squeezed by high fuel costs and a sluggish economy.
Earlier on Tuesday, IAG said its Spanish unit Iberia had started the formal process of collective redundancy over
3,807 jobs, part of its plans to cut capacity by 15%. And Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Europe's biggest airline by

Euro watchdog set to block Ryanair's  bid for Irish rival

RYANAIR yesterday said that its bid to take over smaller Irish rival  Aer Lingus  is to be blocked by Europe's anti-monopoly watchdog.

If the bid is rejected, it could mark the end of  Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary's long-held ambition to seize control of Ireland's former flag carrier.

The European Commission, which acts as the European Union's competition authority, told Ryanair executives at a meeting yesterday that it intends to block the bid, according to Ryanair's statement.
A Commission spokesman said a final decision had not yet been taken.

"It appears clear from this morning's meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said in a statement following a meeting with Commission representatives.
Aer Lingus said it had not been informed of any decision, but said it had always expected a rejection.
"It was and remains Aer Lingus's position that the offer should never have been made," it said in a statement. Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, was told last month that it had one last chance to submit measures to
ensure the proposed 694 million-euro ($928m) merger did not reduce competition.

Ryanair's latest offer to the Commission included ceding 43 routes to a newly created Irish subsidiary of British airline Flybe and handing to British Airways the routes Aer Lingus operates from London's Gatwick Airport.

The commission's principle objection was over the viability of the envisaged new carrier Flybe Ireland and whether British Airways would continue the routes after an initial three-year period, a source close to the talks said.
Flybe said in a statement it was disappointed by the news and was awaiting the result of Ryanair's appeal. "The Commission will take a decision in this case at the end of February or the beginning of March," said a
spokesman for EU competition chief Joaquin Almunia, who declined to comment further on the Ryanair
statement.

The Commission blocked Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus in 2007 and Ryanair dropped its second in 2009.

Ryanair's offer of concessions went further in its latest bid than it had before, but failed to win over Irish political or public opinion.

"People are happy with the status quo, they have a soft spot for Aer Lingus," said Cathay Daly, a financial services professional from Dublin.
"People were happy Ryanair brought some competition to Ireland but they don't want them to take it out." Ryanair flies to 27 destinations from Leeds Bradford Airport, ranging from city breaks to winter and summer sun
holiday destinations.

RYANAIR'S latest attempt to take over Irish rival  Aer Lingus  has been scuppered by the  European Commission.

The budget airline said it will appeal after the Commission indicated during a "state of play" meeting that it will prohibit the €694m (£597m) takeover.

Ryanair had argued that its offer to give 43 short-haul routes and €100m to regional carrier Flybe as part of the takeover would ease competition concerns. Shares in Aer Lingus fell 4.3 per cent.

RYANAIR demanded a "fair hearing" in court yesterday as it said the  EU was set to block its takeover of  Aer       Lingus.

The budget airline said it had been told at a meeting with officials that the £596.3million deal would be blocked. This is despite attempts by  Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary to meet competition concerns.
"It is clear we were not going to get a fair hearing," said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely.

"We have no alternative but to appeal and we expect to get a fair hearing at the European Courts. This decision is clearly to meet the interests of the Irish Government."

Ryanair ready to appeal EC's Aer Lingus  decision

IRISH airline Ryanair last night vowed to take its battle for control of rival budget carrier  Aer Lingus  to court after being told the European Commission (EC) plans to block its takeover bid.

At a "state of play" meeting with officials yesterday,  Ryanair was told the  EC would "prohibit" the airline's offer for its rival, the third to be tabled since 2006.

News of the decision came despite Ryanair lining up British Airways-owner IAG to take over all of its operations at Gatwick airport and rival carrier Flybe to take on 43 Aer Lingus routes from Ireland to the UK and Europe if the bid was successful.

Spokesman Robin Kiely said: "Ryanair has no alternative but to appeal any prohibition decision and we expect to get a fair hearing at the European courts, as we haven't received one from Commissioner [JoaquÃn] Almunia and his case team.

"This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law."
A spokesman for Aer Lingus responded: "The number of routes into and out of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and
Ryanair compete has sharply increased since 2007.
"The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger in this instance than with the previous offers."

Flybe, which is run by Scots-born executive chairman Jim French, said that it was "disappointed by this news" and added that it will "await the outcome of the appeal process" put in motion by Ryanair.

Ryanair already holds a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus following its previous takeover attempts for the company.

The Irish government is expected to be forced to sell its 25.1 per cent holding in the flag carrier as a result of its international bail-out.

Ryanair brought back down to earth by Brussels rebuff

The European Commission has told Ryanair that it intends to block a proposed hostile takeover of  Aer Lingus on competition grounds, the Irish lowcost airline claimed yesterday. After months of wrangling over the impact of the €694 million (£597 million) bid,  Ryanair said that it had been given an informal red light at a meeting with officials in Brussels. The airline has instructed lawyers to prepare an appeal to the  European courts.

Robin Kiely, a Ryanair spokesman, said: "This decision is clearly a political one ... and is not based on competition law." Ryanair had pledged to offload 43 routes to and from Ireland to a rival, Flybe, to create a viable competitor in the skies over Dublin. The budget carrier also offered to cede some valuable landing slots at Heathrow airport to British Airways.

However, Ryanair indicated that these commitments were insufficient to satisfy Joaquín Almunia, the Spanish member of the European Commission responsible for competition policy. "It appears clear from this morning's meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Mr Kiely said.

Flybe's shares slumped 12 per cent to 50¼p after yesterday's news, while Aer Lingus's stock dropped by 4.3 per cent on the Dublin market.

If the Commission formally prohibits the deal, it will be the second time in six years that Ryanair has been prevented from buying Aer Lingus. A similar proposal ran into opposition from European regulators in 2007.

A Commission spokesman insisted that it was yet to take a decision on the case. Aer Lingus said: "It was and remains Aer Lingus's position that the offer should never have been made."

A quarter of Aer Lingus's shares are held by the Irish Government, which plans to sell them, with a further 30 per cent stake being held by Ryanair.

(AE) COMPETITION: Commission rejects  Ryanair's  plan to buy up Aer Lingus

Brussels, 12/02/2013 (Agence  Europe) - Irish low-cost airline  Ryanair announced on Tuesday 12 February that the European Commission had told it that it would be rejecting its planned buy-up of  Aer Lingus  as uncompetitive, despite the recent concessions made by  Ryanair (see EUROPE 10779) to address the Commission's concerns after an initial bid was rejected in 2007 and a second bid in 2009.  Ryanair said that it had asked lawyers to lodge an appeal in the  European courts against any ban, because the Commission's decision was clearly a political decision to protect the Irish government's rights in  Aer Lingus  (it is an Aer Lingus shareholder) rather than competition law. A Ryanair spokesperson said that Brussels was using much tighter criteria for  Ryanair than for any other airline, given Ryanair's concessions for the  Aer Lingus  deal. The Commission refused to comment, but  Ryanair said its formal decision was expected at the end of the month or beginning of next.

In June 2012, Ryanair offered €694 million for Aer Lingus, in which it already owns a 29.82% stake, with the aim of forming Ireland's biggest airline. Aer Lingus says the offer is too low and has urged shareholders to reject it. (FG/transl.fl)

Flybe disappointed with EC's decision to ban Ryanair-Aer Lingus  deal

13 February 2013 – UK regional airline company Flybe Group Plc (LON:FLYB) said it is disappointed by the news that the  European Commission (EC) will most certainly block Irish low-cost carrier  Ryanair Holdings Plc’s (LON:RYA) planned buyout of Aer Lingus  Group Plc (LON:AERL).

EC’s expected decision would not only prevent Ryanair from taking the 70% it does not already own in its smaller rival, but also hinder Flybe’s deal to acquire 43 Aer Lingus  UK and European routes plus some aircraft for EUR1m (USD1.3m). This latest agreement is part of Ryanair’s “unprecedented” remedies package in connection with the  Aer Lingus  bid. The company had also agreed to sell all of its and  Aer Lingus’  London-Gatwick operations to International Airlines Group (LON:IAG).

Yesterday, Ryanair announced it was notified by the EC of its intention to ban the buyout despite the offered concessions. The company also noted it would appeal any prohibition decision to the European Courts. In its own statement, Flybe said it would wait to see the outcome of that process.

Ryanair is offering a price of EUR1.30 (USD1.75) per share to buy the remaining shares in Aer Lingus, thus valuing the company at EUR694m.
Status: Agreed Type group: Type: Corporate acquisition Buyer: Flybe Group Plc
Country: Ireland
Deal size (USD): 1.3m

Target: Aer Lingus' routes and aircraft

As per the release,  EU Commission seems to reject  Ryanair s latest bid for  Aer Lingus.

Ryanair sated that it has been notified this morning (February 12) at a State of Play meeting with the  EU Commission, that the  EU Commission intends to prohibit Ryanair s offer for  Aer Lingus,  despite the fact that Ryanair has met every competition concern raised in the EU s Statement of Objections and during the review process, including providing the  EU at its request with irrevocable commitments from not one, but two, upfront buyers to eliminate all competitive overlaps between  Ryanair and Aer Lingus

Recently, Ryanair s named the head of communications Robin Kiely stated that, It appears clear from this morning s meeting, that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and we're going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules.

Given Ryanair s remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU s Statement of Objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules.

Ryanair has no alternative but to appeal any prohibition decision and we expect to get a fair hearing at the European Courts, as we haven t received one from Commissioner Almunia and his case team. This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish Government and is not based on competition law.

RYANAIR has admitted defeat in its renewed TAKEOVER bid for riVal  Aer Lingus  but Vowed to fight the decision in the courts.

The budget carrier said it had been notified by the  European Commission that the €694million buyout plan would be rejected and claimed that  European chiefs were holding it to a much higher standard than any other  EU airline.

'It appears clear from this morning's meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules,' Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said last night.
Ryanair said it was told of the decision at a meeting with the EU Commission yesterday.

The TAKEOVER plan - a third bid by Michael o'Leary for Aer Lingus - appeared to HAVE been boosted last week when Flybe agreed a plan to fly 43 of Aer Lingus's short-haul routes, easing competition concerns.

There had also been a commitment from the IAG airline group to run oVerlapping Aer Lingus/Ryanair routes between Dublin and London Gatwick to ensure competition.

'GiVen Ryanair's remedies package clearly addresses eVery issue raised in the EU's Statement of objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in CONTRAVENtion of EU competition rules,' Mr Kiely added.

'This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, Vested interests of the Irish GoVernment and is not based on competition law.' Ryanair has instructed lawyers to appeal the refusal to the European courts.
Aer Lingus said it was in a much stronger position now than at the time of the first TAKEOVER bid in 2007.

'The reasons for prohibition are therefore eVen stronger in this instance than with the PREVIOUs offers. Therefore, it was and remains Aer Lingus' position that the offer should NEVER HAVE been made,' a spokesman for the airline said.

Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said the Ryanair offer did not come up to the required standards to ease concerns oVer competition.

'As I HAVE stated before, the Ryanair remedies package as reported has not satisfied the GoVernment's concerns about CONNECTIVITY, competition or employment,' Mr Varadkar said.
'I do not wish to make further comment until the European Commission has formally made its decision.' Document METRO00020130213e92d0000k

PARIS -- Even the third time may not be the charm for  Ryanair's attempt to take over Ireland's flag carrier  Aer    Lingus.

Ryanair, based in Dublin and  Europe's largest budget airline by number of passenger, said it had been informed at a meeting Tuesday with officials of the European Commission that Brussels ''intends to prohibit'' the airline's nearly €700 million, or $942 million, bid for Aer Lingus.  The company said its proposed concessions and remedies did not go far enough to allay antitrust concerns.
Ryanair threatened to appeal any rejection of the merger to the European Court of Justice.

''It appears clear from this morning's meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules,'' said Robin Kiely, a Ryanair spokesman.
Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the European Union's competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia,
declined to comment Tuesday. He said a formal decision on a Ryanair-Aer Lingus combination would be made in
late February or early March by the European Commission, the Union's administrative arm.

The odds of winning approval for a combination of the two Irish carriers have never been strong, analysts said. Brussels has already rejected two previous attempts by Ryanair over the past six years to win control of Aer Lingus, a full-service airline that is 25 percent owned by the Irish government.

The government has opposed Ryannair's overtures, saying that it would leave Ireland, an island nation, too dependent on one operator for vital air links abroad.

Ryanair already owns nearly 30 percent of Aer Lingus, and is seeking to buy out the government's stake and the rest of the airline's outstanding shares.
Given that history of rejections, investors were stunned when Ryanair announced last June that it was offering
€694 million in cash for the stock of Aer Lingus it did not already own.

The offer of €1.30 a share, represented a 38 percent premium to Aer Lingus's price at the time, but was less than half the €1.48 billion that Ryanair first bid for the stake back in 2006.

Back then, Aer Lingus was decidedly more vulnerable, hemorrhaging so much money on unprofitable routes and financing its debts that banks were refusing to provide fresh loans to finance its operations. Ryanair, which was expanding rapidly, coveted Aer Lingus's valuable take-off and landing slots at key airports like Heathrow in London.

A drastic restructuring plan, implemented in 2009 by a new chief executive, Christoph Mueller, managed to stem the bleeding. By 2010, Aer Lingus was reporting an annual operating profit, its first since 2007.

The European Commission, which opened a detailed investigation into Ryanair's latest bid in August, has echoed the Irish government's concerns that a merged Ryanair-Aer Lingus would leave air travelers to and from Ireland with too little choice. Ryanair's merger proposal envisioned operating the two airlines as separate businesses, although the two would control more than 70 percent of the Irish air travel market between them.

In recent months, Ryanair said it had approached rival European airlines, including British Airways and Flybe, offering to sell dozens of routes between Ireland, Britain and Europe in a bid to preserve competition and secure regulatory approval.

Ryanair described its proposed remedies as ''unprecedented'' and dismissed regulators' objections as politically motivated.

''This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish Government and is not based on competition law,'' said Mr. Kiely, the Ryanair spokesman.

The Irish government has come under pressure in recent years to dispose of its 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus, along with other state assets, as it seeks to pay back the €85 billion it received from a European bailout fund in
2010. But it has been reluctant to put its shares on the market, for fear they would be snapped up by Ryanair.

For its part, Aer Lingus said that its own improved financial performance over the past year argued even more strongly against a combination with Ryanair. The airline last week reported a 41 percent rise in operating profit for
2012, to €69 million, as its annual passenger numbers rose to a record 10.8 million.

''It was and remains Aer Lingus's position that the offer should never have been made,'' the airline said in a statement.

Ryanair contends that the competitive landscape in European air travel has changed significantly since its most recent failed bid for Aer Lingus, in 2008. The budget carrier notes that European regulators have since approved a series of big airline mergers, including that of British Airways and Iberia of Spain to form International Airlines Group in 2010, and that group's subsequent acquisition of British Midland International in late 2011.

Ryanair's bid to take over  Aer Lingus  is to be blocked by EU

Ryanair's bid to take over smaller Irish rival Aer Lingus is to be blocked by Europe's anti-monopoly watchdog, the low-cost carrier said on Tuesday Feb. 12, a "political" decision it said it would challenge in court. The rejection of what Ryanair has described as its third and final bid for its rival, likely marks the end of a long-held ambition of Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary to seize control of the country's 75-year-old former flag carrier. The European Commission, which acts as the European Union's competition authority, told Ryanair executives at a meeting on Tuesday morning that it intends to block the bid, Ryanair said in a statement. A Commission spokesman said a final decision had not yet been taken. "It appears clear from this morning's meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said in a statement following a meeting with Commission representatives. "This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law," he said. Aer Lingus said it had not been informed of any decision, but said it had always expected a rejection. "It was and remains Aer Lingus's position that the offer should never have been made," it said in a statement. Wed, Feb 13, 2013 AirGuideOnline ISSN 1544-3760

AER RAGE; Ryanair to appeal EU blocking of bid

FURIOUS  Ryanair said it will appeal an  EU Commission decision to block its takeover of  Aer Lingus.

The Commission told chiefs at the budget airline yesterday morning their offer for the former national carrier would be prohibited.

Ryanair has now vowed to take its case to the European courts after desperate attempts to get the Commission onside failed.

And it claimed it had done everything in its power to persuade Europe a takeover would not result in Ryanair running an air monopoly in Europe.

This is the third attempt Ryanair, headed up by Michael O'Leary, has made to land Aer Lingus after failing in 2007 and 2009.
It already holds a stake of nearly 30% in Aer Lingus.

Ryanair said it provided the EU Commission with commitments from two buyers to remove any anti-competition fears between Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
In a statement, Ryanair said that IAG and Flybe had both promised to take over parts of both airlines' London
Gatwick operations and other UK and European routes.
The airline said both have agreed to come to Ireland to compete against a combined Ryanair and Aer Lingus. Ryanair complained last night that it was being held to a higher standard than other European airlines. Spokesman Robin Kiely complained the airline was never going to get a fair hearing.
He said: "It appears clear that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules.
"Given that Ryanair's remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU's Statement of
Objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules.
"Ryanair has no alternative but to appeal any prohibition decision and we expect to get a fair hearing at the
European Courts as we haven't received one from Commissioner Almunia and his case team."
He claimed the decision was "political" and not based on competition law.

Earlier, Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said the Ryanair proposal did not do enough to protect passengers and connectivity, but added the Government will sell its stake at the right time, for the right price and in the right conditions.

Ryanair rails at 'unfair' EC block over Aer Lingus  bid

RYANAIR has accused European competition officials of not giving it a "fair hearing" after they signalled they would block the airline's proposed takeover of rival  Aer Lingus.

The low–cost carrier said it was told at a "state of play" meeting with the  European Commission yesterday that officials intended to prohibit  Ryanair's latest €694m (£597m) tilt at its Irish rival.

The decision will mark the third time in seven years Ryanair has failed to secure a takeover of Aer Lingus. While the EC is yet to publish an official ruling, Ryanair said it had instructed its lawyers to build the case for an appeal.

The airline had secured a commitment from Flybe, the loss–making UK carrier, to operate 43 Aer Lingus routes between Ireland and Europe, where the EC was concerned Ryanair would have a monopoly. British Airways–owner International Airlines Group had also agreed to take on Aer Lingus's flights between Ireland and Gatwick in the event of a takeover gaining approval from competition officials.

Ryanair claimed it was being held to a "much higher standard" than other airlines by the EC as its agreements with Flybe and IAG addressed competition concerns. "It appears clear … that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing," said a Ryanair spokesman. "Given Ryanair's remedies package addresses every issue raised in the EU's statement of objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules."

Antoine Colombani, the EC's spokesman for competition, said: "The Commission will take a decision in this case at the end of February or the beginning of March."

On 12 February, Irish airline  Ryanair issued a press release announcing that the  European Commission will be turning down the offer it made to acquire Irish competitor airline  Aer Lingus.  The Commission's decision has in fact been postponed to early March. But  Ryanair says that it was "notified at a state of play meeting with the Commission that the Commission intends to prohibit  Ryanair's offer for  Aer Lingus,  despite the fact that  Ryanair has met every competition concern raised".  Ryanair intends to appeal. The airline is of the view that its "remedies package is unprecedented" and that the  EU executive is "holding  Ryanair to a much higher standard than any other EU airline".  Ryanair's spokesperson Robin Kiely said: "This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government [the Irish government retains a 25% stake in  Aer Lingus]  and is not based on competition law" (see  Europolitics 4575 and 4580).

After Ryanair issued its press release, an Aer Lingus spokesperson said that "the offer should never have been made," and called for Ryanair to divest its 29.82% stake in Aer Lingus. Meanwhile, Irish Transport Minister Leo Varadkar stressed that "the Ryanair remedies package as reported has not satisfied the government's concerns about connectivity, competition or employment".

EC ends Flybe Ireland

Ryanair's bid for  Aer Lingus  looks set to be harpooned by the  European Commission, ending hopes of
Exeter-based carrier Flybe's 100 million euro launch of Flybe Ireland.

Ryanair has been notified by the  European Commission that its 694 million euro  Aer Lingus  buyout will be rejected.
Describing the decision as "political" the low-cost carrier said it would appeal.

Last week, Flybe confirmed it had agreed with Ryanair to fly 43 short-haul Aer Lingus routes, in a move to satisfy competition rules if Ryanair's takeover bid was successful.

Under the deal, a new company, Flybe Ireland, would be established and receive a minimum of nine Airbus A320 aircraft and £89.5 million cash. Yesterday, Ryanair claimed European chiefs were holding it to higher standards than any other EU airline.

A statement issued by Flybe last night said it was "disappointed" but would await the outcome of an appeal. It stressed: "The proposed transaction with Ryanair to transfer a number of aircraft and operating routes to Flybe is contingent upon the EC's approval of Ryanair's proposed remedies and a successful bid by Ryanair for Aer Lingus."

THE European Commission has told Ryanair it will reject the low-cost carrier’s attempt to take over smaller Irish rival Aer Lingus,  Ryanair has revealed.
It said a final decision had not yet been taken.

Ryanair, which has indicated that this third bid for Aer Lingus would be its last, said it would launch an appeal in European courts against the decision by the commission, which acts as the European Union’s competition authority.

“It appears clear from this morning’s meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules,” a Ryanair spokesman said.

“This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law,” he added.

Ryanair, Europe’s biggest budget airline, was told last month that it had one last chance to submit measures to ensure the proposed €694 million (£596m) merger did not reduce competition.

Ryanair’s latest bid included ceding 43 routes to Flybe and hand to British Airways the routes Aer Lingus operates from London’s Gatwick Airport.

Ryanair expects its euros 694m (pounds 597m) takeover of the Irish airline  Aer Lingus  to be blocked by EU
officials, it said yesterday.

The budget airline said the  European commission had indicated it would prohibit the takeover at a "state of play" meeting with commission officials in Brussels.  Ryanair said the commission's decision was "clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law".

The airline, which is making its third attempt to buy Aer Lingus in six years, said it had no alternative but to appeal against the decision through the courts. "We expect to get a fair hearing at the European courts, as we haven't received one from EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia and his case team," Ryanair said. The airline, which owns 29.82% of Aer Lingus, added: "It appears clear . . . that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules.

"The EU commission intends to prohibit Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus, despite the fact Ryanair has met every competition concern raised in the EU's statement of objections and during the review process, including providing the EU - at its request - with irrevocable commitments from not one, but two, upfront buyers to eliminate all competitive overlaps between Ryanair and Aer Lingus."
Ryanair said BA's owner IAG had committed to "take over divestments of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus's entire
London-Gatwick operations", while Flybe had agreed to take over 43 Aer Lingus UK and European routes.

Ryanair had "instructed its lawyers to appeal against any prohibition decision to the European courts". The commission is expected to pronounce its formal decision on the takeover on 6 March. It declined to comment.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, has said the takeover would create "one strong Irish airline group" capable of competing with IAG, Air France and Lufthansa.

He said Aer Lingus had "failed to deliver value for shareholders" in the six years since Ryanair made its first takeover bid. He said Ryanair's offer was the "best way for Aer Lingus to continue to be owned, controlled and managed from Ireland for the benefit of Irish citizens and visitors".

Ryanair said the decision to block its takeover of Aer Lingus was 'clearly political, to meet the interests of the Irish government'

Budget airline  Ryanair says it will go to court after  European commission indicates it will reject  Aer Lingus
takeover bid

Ryanair expects its €694m (£560m) takeover of the Irish flag carrier  Aer Lingus  to be blocked by EU officials.

The budget airline said the European commission had indicated it would prohibit the takeover at a "state of play" meeting with commission officials in Brussels on Tuesday.

He said Ryanair's offer was the "best way for Aer Lingus to continue to be owned, controlled and managed from Ireland for the benefit of Irish citizens and visitors".

Ryanair's €1.30 a share offer for the 70.18% of Aer Lingus it doesn't already own represented a 38.3% premium over Aer Lingus' closing price when it made the offer last June.

EC 'ready to block'  Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus

The European Commission (EC) is set to block  Ryanair's planned takeover of  Aer Lingus,  the Irish budget airline said yesterday, in what would be its third failed attempt to take control of its smaller rival.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said it was told in a meeting with the EC that the competition watchdog "intends to prohibit" the €694m bid for the Irish flag carrier.

If so, it would be the second time Brussels has vetoed a takeover by Ryanair for Aer Lingus, having blocked a move in 2007. In 2009 Ryanair dropped another attempt after running up against opposition from the Irish government, which owns 25 per cent of Aer Lingus.

Leo Varadkar, the Irish Transport minister, has also said he does not support the latest bid, which was launched last year.

Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said that after yesterday's meeting it "appears clear... that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules".
He claimed the move was "clearly a political one", saying Ryanair - which already holds a 30 per cent stake in Aer
Lingus - had offered a remedies package that "clearly addresses every issue raised" by Brussels.

Concessions proposed including paying regional airline Flybe to take over a number of Aer Lingus' routes and an agreement for British Airways owner IAG to fly both Ryanair and Aer Lingus' routes from Gatwick.

Ryanair said it would appeal a veto in the European Courts. Antoine Colombani, an EC spokesman, said a final decision would not be made until the end of this month or the start of March. Aer Lingus, whose board has rejected the takeover offer, said in a statement its position "was and remains ... that the offer should never have been made".

The average age of the Ryanair fleet is just 4.2 years, making it one of the youngest fleets in the European airline business.

Ryanair's  pursuit of Aer Lingus  has no clear winners

The champagne may well have been flowing at  Aer Lingus  headquarters yesterday. But news that the  EU
intends to block  Ryanair''s third effort to buy its rival is far from the end of this long-running soap opera.
It''s difficult to see who emerges as the clear winner in all this.

While Aer Lingus may be celebrating, there are serious questions about its long-term future that remain unanswered. It''s profitable now, but growth in Ireland is anaemic, and any major external shock - natural or economic - could quickly make things very difficult.

European airlines have been consolidating and Aer Lingus probably needs to find a suitor before it becomes an old maid.

For Ryanair, the rebuff also signals decision time for Michael O''Leary. He has delivered strong growth for the airline over the past 20 years, but how long will his board allow him to keep pursuing Aer Lingus? He insists he wants to grow Aer Lingus, but in the same breath dismisses it as a small airline on the edge of Europe. So why bother with it? Aer Lingus is a political hot potato, but consumers also have an affection for it that goes back decades. Ryanair had offered UK airline Flybe 43 Aer Lingus routes in order to appease Brussels, and Flybe said it would be committed to the Irish market and would grow services here.

Consumers are entitled to wonder, though, whether a UK airline - and even Ryanair - would retain the same level of commitment to Ireland as Aer Lingus would.

For now, the end game is still some way off. The only winners so far have been the lawyers and advisers. Since last summer, Aer Lingus has spent €10m on legal and other fees battling the latest Ryanair bid. That brings to
€40m the amount it has spent defending three bids. Ryanair has undoubtedly spent a stack of money too.
For the lawyers, this is a tussle that just keeps on giving. Document IINM000020130213e92d00037

New blow in O'Leary bid to gain control of Aer Lingus; Third rejection for Ryanair boss in takeover
attempt New blow in O'Leary bid to grab control of Aer Lingus

MICHAEL O'Leary has suffered a fresh blow in his efforts to take control of  Aer Lingus  after EU watchdogs shot down his third attempt to buy the airline.

The European Commission said it intends to block the airline's €694m bid for the former flag carrier because it would reduce competition for Irish travellers.

While consumers and the Government breathed a sigh of relief at the news, Ryanair said it "won't just walk away" from its investment in Aer Lingus and would appeal the decision in the European courts.
That raises the prospect of legal proceedings in Europe that could drag on for years.
The airline lashed out at the EU move to block its bid, describing it as "clearly a political one" that is designed to
"meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish Government and is not based on competition law".
"We haven't spent €400m investing in Aer Lingus to just walk away from it," Ryanair deputy chief executive
Howard Millar told the Irish Independent.

"We won't be shy and retiring about this. We gave it our best shot but they've told us no twice now in no uncertain terms. We thought we had a fair chance," he said. "There will never be the likes again of the remedies we've proposed."
The ruling comes as a massive blow to Ryanair and chief executive Michael O'Leary.

Over the past number of months Ryanair has been pulling out all the stops to try to ease competition concerns and persuade the European Commission that it should be allowed to pursue a takeover of Aer Lingus.

Continued on Page 10 Comment JOHN MULLIGAN Saga still has a long way to run A package of remedies designed to allay EU concerns included the offer to hand over 43 Aer Lingus routes to rival airline. Flybe and to give landing slots at Gatwick Airport to British Airways. But at a meeting yesterday morning, the Commission's competition watchdogs told Ryanair that they intend to block the latest attempt to buy Aer Lingus. A formal announcement will be made by the Commission by March 6.

The ruling will also reignite a UK competition probe that could ultimately force Ryanair to sell its near 30pc stake in Aer Lingus. Despite preparing to battle the refusal from Brussels in court, Mr Millar said that Ryanair wouldn't rule out selling its Aer Lingus stake if the right kind of offer was made. "If somebody puts an offer down, if Etihad made an offer we couldn't refuse for example, well clearly we'd have to consider it," he said.

Abu Dhabi-based Etihad already owns almost 3pc of Aer Lingus. "We don't want the bottomfishers or carpet baggers," he added. Trade unions representing Aer Lingus staff, including IMPACT and SIPTU, remained
tight-lipped yesterday, declining to Comment on the European Commission 's position. Transport Minister Leo Varadkar, who had indicated before Christmas that the Government would not be selling its 25.1pc stake in Aer Lingus to Ryanair, yesterday said that the remedies package proposed by Ryanair "has not satisfied the Government's concerns about connectivity, competition or employment". Competition He said the offer, which involved breaking up the airline. and giving parts of it to British Airways and Flybe, was "a strange way of achieving competition".

"If I were a Ryanair shareholder I would be very concerned about what they have spent on this takeover offer. Why are Ryanair burning the money of shareholders?" Aer Lingus insisted that the reasons for blocking the latestRyanair bid are "even stronger" now than when previous offers were made. "Therefore, it was and remains Aer Lingus's position that the offer should never have been made," it said. Mr O'Leary has claimed that Aer Lingus faces being split up if Ryanair is blocked from acquiring it. Last year he said Ryanair had received
approaches from a number of financial institutions interested in acquiring its Aer Lingus stake and breaking up the airline. "If the Commission turns down this remedies package, then I think we would have to seriously consider exiting our investment in Aer Lingus , which will without question result in Aer Lingus being broken up," Mr
O'Leary said, following Ryanair's annual general meeting last year.

The European Commission is set to block  Ryanair's proposed takeover of  Aer Lingus,  according to the Irish budget airline, in what would be its third failed attempt to take control of its smaller rival.
Michael O'Leary's Ryanair said it was told during a meeting with the commission that the competition watchdog
"intends to prohibit" the €694m (£598m) bid for the Irish flag carrier.

If so, it would be the second time Brussels has vetoed a takeover of Air Lingus by Ryanair, having blocked a move in 2007. In 2009 Ryanair dropped another attempt after running up against opposition from the Irish government, which owns 25 per cent of Aer Lingus.

Leo Varadkar, the Irish transport minister, has also said he does not support the latest bid, which was launched last year.

Robin Kiely, a Ryanair spokesman, said after yesterday's meeting that it "appears clear … that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules".
A final decision is not expected until the end of this month. Document IND0000020130213e92d0001w

Ryanair's  Aer Lingus  case to go to EU court

RYANAIR is heading to the  European courts to challenge the rejection of its latest takeover bid for  Aer Lingus.

But Transport Minister Leo Varadkar last night called on  Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary to give up his crusade and stop 'burning tens of millions of euro' more of his shareholders' money on legal fees in pursuing a lost cause.

Ryanair, which has already bought a 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, held meetings with the European Commission yesterday to discuss its third attempt to take over its rival. The Commission, which acts as the EU's competition watchdog, told Ryanair executives at the meeting it intends to block the bid - according to a Ryanair statement - dealing what appears to be a final crushing defeat to Mr O'Leary's long-held ambitions to merge Aer Lingus and Ryanair under one umbrella operation.

Speaking about the latest bid being blocked, Mr Varadkar told last night's RTÉ Six One News: 'If that is the case then it's something that I welcome. It does vindicate the Government's view that allowing Ryanair to take over Aer Lingus and break it up would damage connectivity, would damage competition and would cost us jobs.' Ryanair said the decision that had been indicated to it was a 'political' one and it immediately announced it was going to challenge the diktat in the European Courts of Justice. Mr O'Leary's team had made a number of changes to their initial bid to try and assuage Commission concerns that Ryanair would have a monopoly if the deal went ahead.

The new merged entity would control up to 90 per cent of all the flights out of Ireland if permission was granted. Ryanair's latest offer included ceding 43 routes to a newly-created Irish subsidiary of British airline Flybe.

Following the Commission meeting, a Ryanair spokesman said: 'This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish Government and is not based on competition law.' Philip Nolan - Page 14

Ryanair to appeal blocking of takeover
497 words

The Irish Examiner

English

Ryanair has instructed lawyers to appeal against the  European Commission’s decision to block its takeover of
Aer Lingus  before the commission has even ruled.

Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said the airline had not received fair hearing from the  European Competition
Commissioner, Joaquín Almunia.

"Given Ryanair’s remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU’s statement of objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules," Ryanair said.
"Ryanair has no alternative but to appeal any prohibition decision and we expect to get a fair hearing at the
European courts, as we haven’t received one from Commissioner Almunia and his case team.

"This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish Government and is not based on competition law."

A spokesperson for the commission’s competition department said: "There will be a decision on this issue at the end of February or the beginning of March."

Ryanair said it had been notified at a ‘state of play’ meeting with the commission that its third Aer Lingus takeover attempt would be blocked.
Ryanair claims it had been held to a higher standard than other airlines, in particular IAG.

Mr Kiely said: "Given that the EU Commission recently approved IAG’s acquisition of BMI at London-Heathrow on the basis of three year commitments, the EU’s claim that it could not be satisfied of IAG’s and FlyBe’s commitments to these Irish routes after three years is another example of the EU holding Ryanair to a much higher standard than any other EU airline."

Ryanair claims it had gone beyond what the EU requires in delivering two airlines, FlyBe and British Airways, who have agreed to take over routes for at least three years to satisfy EU competition concerns.

Aer Lingus said that although it was unaware of any decision by the European Competition Commission, the takeover attempt should never have been made.

"Ryanair’s first attempt to take over Aer Lingus was prohibited in 2007 on competition grounds. Aer Lingus is a much stronger airline today than it was at the time of the previous Ryanair offers and is Ryanair’s only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes," a spokesperson for the airline said.

"The number of routes into and out of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete has sharply increased since 2007. The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger in this instance than with the previous offers. Therefore, it was and remains Aer Lingus’s position that the offer should never have been made."

Transport Minister Leo Varadkar has repeatedly stated the Government’s opposition to the takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair.

"I note the Ryanair statement. As I have stated before, the Ryanair remedies package as reported, has not satisfied the Government’s concerns about connectivity, competition or employment," he said.

Business - Ryanair admits defeat on Aer Lingus  takeover

Ryanair has admitted defeat in its renewed takeover bid for rival  Aer Lingus  but vowed to fight the decision in court.
The low-cost carrier said it had been notified by the  European Commission that the EUR694 million (£596.7m)
buyout plan would be rejected.
Ryanair said European chiefs were holding it to much higher standards than any other EU airline.

"It appears clear from this morning's meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said.

The takeover plan - a third bid by chief executive Michael O'Leary for Aer Lingus - appeared to have been boosted last week when Flybe agreed a plan to fly 43 of Aer Lingus's short-haul routes, easing competition concerns.

There had also been a commitment from the IAG airline group to run overlapping Aer Lingus/Ryanair routes between Dublin and London Gatwick to ensure competition.

"Given Ryanair's remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU's Statement of Objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules," Mr Kiely said.

"This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law."
Ryanair has instructed lawyers to appeal the refusal to the European courts.
Aer Lingus said it was in a much stronger position now than at the time of the first takeover bid in 2007.

"The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger in this instance than with the previous offers. Therefore, it was and remains Aer Lingus' position that the offer should never have been made," a spokesman said.
Aer Lingus said it has not received notification from the Commission of the decision.
The Irish government retained a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus after its privatisation in 2006.

The former flag carrier was hit by Ryanair's first takeover challenge a year after the floatation but Aer Lingus now maintains its rival is its only significant competitor on most routes in and out of Ireland.
Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus was prohibited in 2007 on competition grounds.

Aer Lingus, which last week posted strong 2012 results with operating profit up 41 per cent to EUR69.1m (£59m), said it would continue to assist a UK Competition Commission investigation into Ryanair's shareholding.

Ryanair to appeal if Aer Lingus  takeover blocked.

Ryanair will appeal any decision by the European Commission to prohibit its takeover of  Aer Lingus,  the airline said yesterday, as it confirmed that European regulators had indicated they plan to block the deal.

Discussions between  Ryanair and the European Commission had been intensifying in recent weeks, with a final decision due before March 6th.
However, Ryanair said yesterday that it had been told by the Commission of its intention to prohibit the deal.

“It appears clear from this morning’s meeting, that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules,” a Ryanair spokesman said yesterday.
Final decision
A European Commission spokesman said a final decision would be made at the end of February or beginning of
March.

While Ryanair’s share price stayed relatively steady yesterday, Aer Lingus shares fell as much as 7.3 per cent yesterday, the biggest intra-day drop in almost a year. About 1.8 million shares were traded, more than 3.5 times the daily average during the last three months.

Ryanair declined to comment yesterday on whether it now intends to sell its 30 per cent shareholding in Aer Lingus. Ryanair has already spent €407.2 million on acquiring a 29.8 per cent stake in the airline. It also declined to comment on whether it plans to submit additional concessions to the European Commission before March 6th.
Ryanair’s latest takeover bid for Aer Lingus, represented its third takeover attempt of the company.

The airline’s first attempt was prohibited in 2007 on competition grounds, while it withdrew its second bid in 2009 following Government opposition. The airline was believed to have offered a much more comprehensive remedies package this time around to allay EU anti-trust concerns. This included a deal with Flybe whereby Ryanair would give the British airline €100 million in cash to help acquire half of Aer Lingus’s short-haul business, as well as a commitment from IAG to operate its London-Gatwick routes.

Noting previous aviation merger decisions, Ryanair accused the EU of “holding Ryanair to a much higher standard than any other EU airline”.
In a statement yesterday, Aer Lingus said it was in a much stronger than it was at the time of the previous
Ryanair offers and was Ryanair’s only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes. Last week, the
former State airline posted a strong set of full-year 2012 results that saw its operating profit rise 40.7 per cent to
€69.1 million.

“The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger in this instance than with the previous offers,” Aer Lingus said in a statement yesterday.

Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar said the Ryanair offer did not meet required standards to ease competition concerns. “The Ryanair remedies package as reported has not satisfied the Government’s concerns about connectivity, competition or employment.”



Page 84 of 121 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Government, which owns 25 per cent of the former state airline, had previously voiced its concerns about the merger. It is expected to sell its stake as part of the conditions of the IMF-EU bailout.
Anti-competitive
Cork Chamber yesterday said a Ryanair-Aer Lingus merger would be anti-competitive and bad for Irish business. Cork Chamber president John Mullins said a favourable decision for Ryanair would effectively leave a single
operator in control of the vast majority of commercial flights into and out of Ireland.

The rejection of Ryanair’s bid for Aer Lingus, if confirmed, will be the first time the Commission has blocked a proposed merger twice.

Third bid for Aer Lingus  fails to fly with commission.
Suzanne Lynch

13 February 2013
The Irish Times

(c) 2013, The Irish Times.
It will not be a case of third time lucky for Michael O’Leary, following what appears to be the  European
Commission’s decision to reject  Ryanair’s third takeover bid for  Aer Lingus.

Ryanair’s decision to publicise the findings ahead of the official announcement raised some eyebrows. The airline is, after all, permitted to submit further concessions before March 6th.

However, Ryanair’s pre-emptive strike is not unusual in this regard. UPS similarly alerted the market to the commission’s decision on its rejected takeover bid for TNT last month ahead of the official announcement.
Ryanair said yesterday it would appeal, pointing out that it had met “every competition concern raised in the EU’s
Statement of Objections and during the review process”.
The airline certainly put forward a remedies package that far outweighed anything proposed in previous bids. Details of a complex remedy package involving the offloading of routes and cash payments to two other airlines,
FlyBE and British Airways, started emerging from Brussels last week.

Whatever the official response of the European Commission, which has declined to comment, those proposed remedies certainly were not enough to satisfy the Government’s concerns about “connectivity, competition or employment”, according to an official statement by Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar yesterday.
But perhaps the irony is that the rejection of the €694 million bid throws up more questions about Aer Lingus than
Ryanair. Attention will now focus on Ryanair’s intentions regarding its 30 per cent shareholding in the airline.
Selling its stake
O’Leary said last September the airline would consider selling its stake if its third takeover bid was rejected. The
Government is also obliged to sell its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus under commitments to the troika.
From a European perspective, the decision has also focused a spotlight on Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s
competition commissioner. While the commission clears the overwhelming majority of mergers, Almunia has been
responsible for blocking three major deals since taking office in 2010 – the merger of NYSE Euronext and
Deutsche Börse, of Greek airlines Aegen and Olympic Air, and the UPS –TNT deal last month.

O’Leary will undoubtedly feel aggrieved at the failure of his bid to get over the line, particularly in light of transactions that have been sanctioned in the aviation industry in recent years. Sources in Brussels have said the deal was being looked at very seriously by the commission.

The airline may also feel that public and Government sentiment towards the deal was muddying what was in fact a matter for competition law.
Public relations

In this regard Ryanair only has itself to blame. Ryanair’s unique public relations strategy based on a dubious customer relations policy meant the dominance of “Europe’s favourite airline” was never going to garner public support despite the enormous benefits the airline has brought to consumers in terms of access and price.
For Ryanair that, in itself, is a disappointing irony.

BUDGET airline  Ryanair demanded a "fair hearing" in court yesterday as it said the  EU was set to block its longplanned takeover of Irish flag carrier  Aer Lingus.

Ryanair, which has described its bid as its third and final chance to take control of its Irish rival, said it had been told at a "state of play" meeting with  EU competition officials that the  EU would not allow the £596.3million deal to go through.

This is despite attempts by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary to meet competition concerns including lining up a deal with regional airline Flybe to establish an Irish operation to take over some of Aer Lingus's short–haul business between the UK and Ireland.

"It is clear that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered we were not going to get a fair hearing. Any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules," said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely. "We have no alternative but to appeal and we expect to get a fair hearing in the European courts. This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government." Flybe said it was disappointed by the news.
The EU said no final decision had been taken. Document THEEXP0020130213e92d0004j

The European Commission has told Ryanair that it intends to block a proposed hostile takeover of  Aer Lingus
on competition grounds, the Irish low-cost airline claimed yesterday.

After months of wrangling over the impact of the €694 million (£597 million) bid,  Ryanair said that it had been given an informal red light at a meeting with officials in Brussels. The airline has instructed lawyers to prepare an appeal to the  European courts.

Robin Kiely, a Ryanair spokesman, said: “This decision is clearly a political one ... and is not based on competition law." Ryanair had pledged to offload 43 routes to and from Ireland to a rival, Flybe, to create a viable competitor in the skies over Dublin. The budget carrier also offered to cede some valuable landing slots at Heathrow airport to British Airways.

However, Ryanair indicated that these commitments were insufficient to satisfy Joaquín Almunia, the Spanish member of the European Commission responsible for competition policy. “It appears clear from this morning’s meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Mr Kiely said.

Flybe’s shares slumped 12 per cent to 50¼p after yesterday’s news, while Aer Lingus’s stock dropped by 4.3 per cent on the Dublin market.

If the Commission formally prohibits the deal, it will be the second time in six years that Ryanair has been prevented from buying Aer Lingus. A similar proposal ran into opposition from European regulators in 2007.

A Commission spokesman insisted that it was yet to take a decision on the case. Aer Lingus said: “It was and remains Aer Lingus’s position that the offer should never have been made."

A quarter of Aer Lingus’s shares are held by the Irish Government, which plans to sell them, with a further 30 per cent stake being held by Ryanair.

• The Spanish Government implored Iberia and the airline’s workers yesterday to reach a compromise over thousands of job cuts after union officials pushed the button on strike action (Graham Keeley writes). The company, part of the International Airlines Group, which also owns British Airways, announced plans to cut 3,807 jobs, or nearly 20 per cent of its workforce. IAG had planned to shed 4,500 staff.

Despite the redundancy target being reduced, unions said that they would go ahead with strikes that Ana Pastor, the Spanish Development Minister, said could cost the airline €10 million a day.

RYANAIR has admitted defeat in its renewed takeover bid for rival  Aer Lingus,  but vowed to fight the decision in the courts.

The low-cost carrier said it had been told by the  European Commission that the €694m (£600m) buyout plan would be rejected.
Ryanair claimed European chiefs were holding it to much higher standards than any other EU airline.

"It appears clear from this morning''s meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said.
Ryanair said it was told of the decision at a state of play meeting with the Commission.

The takeover plan — a third bid by Michael O''Leary for Aer Lingus — appeared to have been boosted last week when Flybe agreed to fly 43 of Aer Lingus' ' short-haul routes, easing competition concerns. Mr Kiely said: "Given Ryanair''s remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU''s Statement of Objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules.

EC block on Ryanair bid a blow for 'Flybe Ireland' deal

The European Commission is set to veto  Ryanair's Aer Lingus  takeover bid, damping hopes of the 100 million euro launch of Flybe Ireland.

Ryanair said it has been notified by the  European Commission that its proposed 694 million euro  Aer Lingus buyout plan will be rejected. Describing the decision as "political" the low-cost carrier said it would launch an appeal in the European courts.

Last week, Exeter-based Flybe confirmed it had reached agreement with Ryanair to fly 43 short-haul Aer Lingus routes, in a move to satisfy competition rules if Ryanair's takeover bid was successful.

Under the deal agreed in principle, a new company, Flybe Ireland, would be estab-lished and receive a minimum of nine Airbus A320 aircraft and a cash injection of worth around £85.9 million from Ryanair. Yesterday, Ryanair claimed European chiefs were holding it to higher standards than any other EU airline.

"It appears clear from [the] meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said.

Ryanair's takeover plan - a third bid by Michael O'Leary for Aer Lingus - appeared to have been boosted last week when Flybe agreed a plan to fly 43 of Aer Lingus' short-haul routes, easing competition concer ns.

There had also been a commitment from the IAG airline group to run overlapping Aer Lingus/Ryanair routes between Dublin and London Gatwick to ensure competition.
Mr Kiely said: "Given Ryanair's remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU's Statement of
Objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules.

"This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish Government and is not based on competition law."
Ryanair has instructed lawyers to appeal the refusal to the European courts.

In a statement issued by Flybe Group last night, the Exeter-based airline said that it was "disappointed" by the news, but it would await the outcome of Ryanair's appeal process. It stressed: "The proposed transaction with Ryanair to transfer a number of aircraft and operating routes to Flybe is contingent upon the EC's approval of Ryanair's proposed remedies and a successful bid by Ryanair for Aer Lingus." Flybe added that it will continue to focus on its delivery of a £35 million cost-savings exercise to get out of the red, announced last month.

Meanwhile, Aer Lingus said it was in a much stronger position now than at the time of Ryanair's first takeover bid in 2007.

A spokesman said: "The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger in this instance than with the previous offers. Therefore, it was and remains Aer Lingus' po-sition that the offer should never have been made."

Europe's low cost airline,  Ryanair Holdings has announced its intentions to appeal against the decision by
European regulator that seeks to block the takeover of Irish carrier  Aer Lingus  by the low-cost airline.

The European Commission had issued formal objections to a new deal by  Ryanair to takeover  Aer Lingus alleging that the combining of the two Dublin based carriers would impact competition climate. Ryanairalso said that it has been informed by the  European Commission that the _694 million takeover proposal is not likely to be approved.

Aer Lingus and Ryanair, both believe that the deal is unlikely to be approved by the European regulators. Ryanair has assured European regulators that there are radical remedies to address the concerns relating to lower competition. On the other hand, Aer Lingus indicated that the deal is headed for a failure. Ryanair already owns
30 percent of Aer Lingus.

Even if Ryanair gets an approval from the EU authorities, it will still have to get an approval from Lingus shareholders and staff before the takeover can be finalized. Reports said that Aer Lingus will have to transfer all but four landing slots at Heathrow airport if it is to merge with its Dublin based partner.

MERGERS : RYANAIR SAYS READY TO APPEAL COMMISSION'S AER LINGUS DECISION

Ryanair is bracing for an arm wrestle with the European Commission, to be judged by the  EU Court of Justice (ECJ). The low-cost airline is fuming after the EU executive announced, on 12 February, that it plans to reject Ryanair's third merger attempt with its Irish competitor,  Aer Lingus  (see Europolitics 4585), which it has a
29.82% stake in.  Ryanair's hopes to create one big Irish airline have once again gone up in smoke and now the airline is contesting what it sees as a biased approach from the  EU executive, which it believes to be "holding Ryanair to a much higher standard than any other  EU airline". Although the  EU's official decision will only be published on 6 March,  Ryanair's spokesperson, Robin Kiely, has already announced that as soon as this happens, the airline's lawyers will contest the decision at the ECJ. "We expect to get a fair hearing at the European courts, as we haven't received one from Commissioner Almunia and his case team," Kiely said.
"UNFAIR" AND "POLITICAL"

"It appears clear from this morning's meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules. Given Ryanair's remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU's statement of objections, any decision to prohibit [Ryanair's offer] would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules. [...] This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on
competition law," said Kiely.

The Commission had concerns that since there is some overlap between Ryanair and Aer Lingus' routes, actual and potential competition on these routes would disappear. It therefore opened an in-depth investigation (phase
2) on 29 August 2012 (4475). To address the Commission's concerns, Ryanair announced, on 5 November, that it had submitted a new "unprecedented" remedies package. Ryanair explained that these concessions would allow other airlines to acquire the routes shared by the two Irish airlines, in exchange for which it would divest some of Aer Lingus' landing slots at Gatwick Airport in the UK (4521). This is of particular interest to British Airways. Ryanair also had "irrevocable commitments" from regional airline Flybe that it would take over 43 of Aer Lingus' routes to the UK and the rest of Europe. Moreover, it had offered Flybe €100 million in funding, nine
Airbus A320, staff and equipment. Flybe is struggling at the moment and saw the transaction as an opportunity to build itself back up. Flybe announced in a statement that it was disappointed and awaited the outcome of the appeal.

Conversely, Aer Lingus, which had several times called on other shareholders to turn down Ryanair's offer, is rather smug. Its spokesperson reaffirmed that "the offer should never have been made". Aer Lingus has announced that it would continue to take part in an investigation carried out by the UK's Competition Commission to bring to light the "anti-competitive effects" of Ryanair's minority participation. The Irish government is also happy: in its view, Ryanair's concessions were not sufficient to address competition problems and problems
linked to the connectivity on flights from the island. Already in June 2007, Ryanair was turned down by the Commission when it applied to acquire Aer Lingus. Ryanair unsuccessfully contested this decision at the EU General Court, with the court finding the Commission's ban on the merger to be valid. The judges also rejected Aer Lingus' request to force Ryanair to divest its minority participation. In 2010, Ryanair itself had decided to give up on its second attempt.

Ryanair bid for rival stymied  again; Budget airline is told E.U. won’t approve its latest offer for Aer Lingus

Even the third time may not be the charm in  Ryanair’s efforts to take over the Irish flag carrier,  Aer Lingus.

Ryanair, which is based in Dublin and is  Europe’s largest budget airline by number of passengers, said it had been informed at a meeting Tuesday with officials of the  European Commission, which oversees competition matters in the European Union, that Brussels ‘‘intends to prohibit’’ the airline’s bid of nearly €700 million, or $941 million, for Aer Lingus.  The company said its proposed concessions and remedies had not gone far enough to allay antitrust concerns.
Ryanair threatened to appeal any rejection of the merger to the European Court of Justice.

‘‘It appears clear from this morning’s meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited, regardless of competition rules,’’ said Robin Kiely, a Ryanair spokesman.
Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the European Union’s competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia,
declined to comment Tuesday. He said a formal decision on a Ryanair-Aer Lingus combination would be made in
late February or early March by the European Commission.

The odds that a combination of the two Irish carriers would win approval have never been strong, analysts said. Brussels has already rejected two previous attempts by Ryanair over the past six years to win control of Aer Lingus, a full-service airline that is 25 percent owned by the Irish government.

The government has opposed Ryanair’s overtures, saying that it would leave Ireland, an island nation, too dependent on one operator for vital air links abroad.

Ryanair already owns nearly 30 percent of Aer Lingus and is seeking to buy out the government’s stake and the rest of the airline’s outstanding shares.
Given the history of rejections, investors were stunned when Ryanair announced last June that it was offering
€694 million in cash for the stock of Aer Lingus it did not already own.

The offer of €1.30 a share represented a 38 percent premium to Aer Lingus’s price at the time, but it was less than half the €1.48 billion that Ryanair first bid for the stake back in 2006.

Then, Aer Lingus was decidedly more vulnerable, hemorrhaging so much money on unprofitable routes and repayment of its debts that banks were refusing to provide fresh loans to finance its operations. Ryanair, which was expanding rapidly, coveted Aer Lingus’s valuable takeoff and landing slots at major airports like Heathrow, serving London.

A drastic restructuring plan, implemented in 2009 by a new chief executive, Christoph Mueller, managed to stem the bleeding. By 2010, Aer Lingus was reporting an annual operating profit, its first since 2007.

The European Commission, which opened a detailed investigation into Ryanair’s latest bid in August, has echoed the Irish government’s concerns that a merged Ryanair-Aer Lingus would leave air travelers to and from Ireland with too little choice. Ryanair’s merger proposal envisioned operating the two airlines as separate businesses, although the two would control more than 70 percent of the Irish air travel market between them.

In recent months, Ryanair said it had approached rival European airlines, including British Airways and Flybe, a low-cost airline based in Britain, offering to sell dozens of routes linking Ireland with Britain and Europe in a bid to preserve competition and secure regulatory approval.

Ryanair described its proposed remedies as ‘‘unprecedented’’ and dismissed regulators’ objections as politically motivated.

‘‘This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish Government and is not based on competition law,’’ said Mr. Kiely, the Ryanair spokesman.

The Irish government has come under pressure in recent years to dispose of its 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus, along with other state assets, as it seeks to pay back the €85 billion it received from a European bailout fund in
2010. But it has been reluctant to put its shares on the market, for fear they would be snapped up by Ryanair.

For its part, Aer Lingus said that its own improved financial performance over the past year argued even more strongly against a combination with Ryanair. Last week, the airline reported a 41 percent increase in operating profit for 2012, to €69 million, from the previous year as its annual passenger numbers rose to a record 10.8 million, including some franchised and code-sharing flights.

‘‘It was and remains Aer Lingus’s position that the offer should never have been made,’’ the airline said in a statement.

Ryanair contends that the competitive landscape in European air travel has changed significantly since its most recent failed bid for Aer Lingus, in 2008. The budget carrier said that European regulators had since approved a series of big airline mergers, including that of British Airways and Iberia of Spain to form International Airlines Group in 2010, and that group’s subsequent acquisition of British Midland International in late 2011.

ISEQ lower: Where to Aer Lingus  now?
354 words
15 February 2013

BNFD

The ISEQ is lower this morning at 3667, down 13 points as  European markets mark time ahead of the G20 meeting.
Where to Aer Lingus  following the failed  Ryanair bid, NCB discusses:

Aer Lingus has informed staff that it will halt all pay increases, including the payment of increments, until the pension dispute is resolved.

Analysis: The payment of increments and other pay increases has been on hold at the company for the past three years under a cost containment programme. Such increases were expected to resume in April this year. Aer Lingus has now proposed that for the next four years normal pay progression would be replaced by a stabilisation programme worth E16m. Aer Lingus argues that such a savings programme would enable it to invest in the pension scheme. Currently, the deficit of the IASS scheme stands at E789m. Changes to actuarial assumptions (discount rate, pensionable pay increases etc) could reduce the deficit signifcantly. This scheme includes both employees of Aer Lingus (two thirds) and the DAA (one third). Any final settlement is likey to see the burden shared some way between the company and the members of the scheme. It is reported that trade unions are seeking an investment of E130m by Aer Lingus into the scheme. Aer Lingus insists that it has no legal obligation
to increase its contributions to the scheme, but to ensure better industrial relations some type of payment, most likely into a new scheme, is likely in our view. Conclusion & Action: Aer Lingus management has indicated that the pension deficit is a key issue that it is looking to resolve this year. While this latest move (halting pay increases) may prove provocative it is likely to concentrate minds, especially if it is followed up by direct discussions. We believe a reasonable settlement over the pension issue would be positive for the share price. The Irish Pensions Board requires also schemes in deficit to put in place a funding plan by this summer, so we would expect to see progress on this issue by then according to NCB Stockbrokers.

Eversheds  and Cleary secure top roles on €150m Flybe-Ryanair deal

Eversheds and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton have advised on a €150m (£128m) deal that could see airline
Flybe acquire 43 short-haul routes operated by  Aer Lingus.

The Irish carrier is currently subject to a €694m (£592m) takeover offer from budget airline  Ryanair. However, the deal is under scrutiny by the  European Commission due to concern a deal could create a monopoly on 46 routes out of Ireland.

But ahead of any decision by the commission, Ryanair has struck a provisional agreement with Exeter-based Flybe that would see the latter set up a new business called Flybe Ireland in the event of a successful takeover bid.
Eversheds advised Flybe on the deal with a team led by corporate partner and Flybe client partner Simon
Masters.

A team from Cleary, consisting of corporate partners Sam Bagot and James Modrall, along with competition partner Nicholas Levy, is advising Ryanair.
As part of the deal, Ryanair will transfer to Flybe Ireland 43 of Aer Lingus' European routes, a minimum of nine
Airbus A320 aircraft and sufficient flight crew and support staff to maintain the routes.

In addition, Ryanair will capitalise the new business with a €100m (£85m) cash injection as well as all forward sales and cash liabilities estimated at a further €50m (£43m) to assist Flybe Ireland in establishing itself as a competitor in Ireland.

Masters said: "Flybe is one of Eversheds' most valued clients, which we have advised for many years. This is the latest in a series of recent deals we have done with Flybe and, if this proposal is implemented, it will greatly assist Flybe in expanding its European presence."

In recent years, Eversheds has advised Flybe on its joint venture with Finnair to acquire Finnish Commuter Airlines, its listing on the London Stock Exchange and its acquisition of low-cost regional service BA Connect from British Airways.

EU decision on Al Ryanair bid next week

EU regulators will decide next week on  Ryanair's third attempt to take over  Aer Lingus  , the EU's antitrust chief said today, a decision that  Europe's top no-frills airline has already said will be negative.

Ryanair said last week the European Commission, which oversees competition in the 27  EU member states, would block its latest takeover bid for Aer Lingus,  criticising such a move as political and one it would challenge in court.
The Commission will announce its decision next week, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told
Reuters.

"The decision is on Feb. 27," he told Reuters, without giving details of the outcome. A veto would be Almunia's fourth rejection of a proposed merger in three years. Last month he blocked plans by world leading package delivery company UPS to acquire Dutch rival TNT Express. Ryanair had offered to pay 100 million euros, transfer nine planes and cede 43 routes to strengthen British rival Flybe in a bid to secure EU regulatory approval. The proposal included Flybe setting up an Irish airline, with Ryanair providing forward sales cash and liabilities worth around 50 million euros. A source close to the deal said Ryanair was also willing to give up Aer Lingus' routes at London's Gatwick Airport to British Airways. The EU competition authority blocked Ryanair's first takeover bid in
2007. The airline abandoned a second attempt in 2009. The Irish government, which holds a 25 percent stake in
Aer Lingus, opposes Ryanair's bid.

On 12 February, Irish airline  Ryanair issued a press release announcing that the  European Commission will be turning down the offer it made to acquire Irish competitor airline  Aer Lingus.  The Commission's decision has in fact been postponed to early March. But  Ryanair says that it was "notified at a state of play meeting with the Commission that the Commission intends to prohibit  Ryanair's offer for  Aer Lingus,  despite the fact that  Ryanair has met every competition concern raised".  Ryanair intends to appeal. The airline is of the view that its "remedies package is unprecedented" and that the  EU executive is "holding  Ryanair to a much higher standard than any other EU airline".  Ryanair's spokesperson Robin Kiely said: "This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government [the Irish government retains a 25% stake in  Aer Lingus]  and is not based on competition law".

After Ryanair issued its press release, an Aer Lingus spokesperson said that "the offer should never have been made," and called for Ryanair to divest its 29.82% stake in Aer Lingus. Meanwhile, Irish Transport Minister Leo Varadkar stressed that "the Ryanair remedies package as reported has not satisfied the government's concerns about connectivity, competition or employment".

MERGERS : RYANAIR SAYS READY TO APPEAL COMMISSION'S AER LINGUS DECISION

Ryanair is bracing for an arm wrestle with the European Commission, to be judged by the  EU Court of Justice (ECJ). The low-cost airline is fuming after the EU executive announced, on 12 February, that it plans to reject Ryanair's third merger attempt with its Irish competitor,  Aer Lingus,  which it has a 29.82% stake in.  Ryanair's hopes to create one big Irish airline have once again gone up in smoke and now the airline is contesting what it sees as a biased approach from the  EU executive, which it believes to be "holding  Ryanair to a much higher standard than any other  EU airline". Although the  EU's official decision will only be published on 6 March, Ryanair's spokesperson, Robin Kiely, has already announced that as soon as this happens, the airline's lawyers will contest the decision at the ECJ. "We expect to get a fair hearing at the  European courts, as we haven't received one from Commissioner Almunia and his case team," Kiely said.
"UNFAIR" AND "POLITICAL"

"It appears clear from this morning's meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules. Given Ryanair's remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU's statement of objections, any decision to prohibit [Ryanair's offer] would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules. [...] This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on
competition law," said Kiely.

The Commission had concerns that since there is some overlap between Ryanair and Aer Lingus' routes, actual and potential competition on these routes would disappear. It therefore opened an in-depth investigation (phase
2) on 29 August 2012. To address the Commission's concerns, Ryanair announced, on 5 November, that it had submitted a new "unprecedented" remedies package. Ryanair explained that these concessions would allow other airlines to acquire the routes shared by the two Irish airlines, in exchange for which it would divest some of
Aer Lingus' landing slots at Gatwick Airport in the UK. This is of particular interest to British Airways. Ryanair also had "irrevocable commitments" from regional airline Flybe that it would take over 43 of Aer Lingus' routes to the UK and the rest of Europe. Moreover, it had offered Flybe €100 million in funding, nine Airbus A320, staff and equipment. Flybe is struggling at the moment and saw the transaction as an opportunity to build itself back up. Flybe announced in a statement that it was disappointed and awaited the outcome of the appeal.

Conversely, Aer Lingus, which had several times called on other shareholders to turn down Ryanair's offer, is rather smug. Its spokesperson reaffirmed that "the offer should never have been made". Aer Lingus has announced that it would continue to take part in an investigation carried out by the UK's Competition Commission to bring to light the "anti-competitive effects" of Ryanair's minority participation. The Irish government is also happy: in its view, Ryanair's concessions were not sufficient to address competition problems and problems
linked to the connectivity on flights from the island. Already in June 2007, Ryanair was turned down by the Commission when it applied to acquire Aer Lingus. Ryanair unsuccessfully contested this decision at the EU General Court, with the court finding the Commission's ban on the merger to be valid. The judges also rejected Aer Lingus' request to force Ryanair to divest its minority participation. In 2010, Ryanair itself had decided to give up on its second attempt.

BRUSSELS, Feb 21 (Reuters) -  EU regulators will decide next week on Ryanair's third attempt to take over  Aer Lingus  , the EU's antitrust chief said on Thursday, a decision that Europe's top no-frills airline has already said will be negative.

Ryanair said last week the European Commission, which oversees competition in the 27  EU member states, would block its latest takeover bid for Aer Lingus,  criticising such a move as political and one it would challenge in court.
The Commission will announce its decision next week, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told
Reuters.
"The decision is on Feb. 27," he told Reuters, without giving details of the outcome.

A veto would be Almunia's fourth rejection of a proposed merger in three years. Last month he blocked plans by world leading package delivery company UPS to acquire Dutch rival TNT Express.

FLYBE'S plans to expand into Ireland suffered a setback when  Ryanair revealed its proposed takeover of  Aer    Lingus  is set to be blocked by the  European Commission.

A package of concessions submitted by the Irish budget airline in an effort to overcome competition concerns includes breaking up Aer Lingus,  with 43 routes and at least nine aircraft and crew transferring to a new Flybe Ireland division of the Exeter-based group.

The deal was conditional on Ryanair's acquisition of Aer Lingus going ahead, and will now depend on the outcome of an appeal against the Commission's decision to block the takeover. Flybe expressed disappointment at the news but said it would await the outcome of Ryanair's appeal.

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary said he isn't preoccupied with pursuing  Aer Lingus,  even though he's planning to appeal an impending  European Union ruling blocking a takeover.

"I'm not obsessed with Aer Lingus,"  Mr O'Leary said yesterday in an interview in Cologne, Germany. "Aer Lingus  is small change." Ryanair heard from the  EU Commission this month that its latest bid for Aer Lingus would be rejected on antitrust grounds.

22 February 2013 - The  European Commission (EC) will announce its decision on the planned buyout of Irish airline Aer Lingus  Group Plc (LON:AERL) by rival Ryanair Holdings Plc’s (LON:RYA) on 27 February, the  EU's competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia told Reuters.

The statement was made after last week  Ryanair said that the antitrust watchdog would ban the deal despite the offered concessions, adding it would appeal any such move in court. Almunia did not specify details about the expected EC’s decision.

Ryanair is offering a price of EUR1.30 (USD1.72) per share to buy the remaining 70% stake it does not already have in Aer Lingus, thus valuing the company at EUR694m. In order to secure approval for the deal, it has offered to contribute EUR100m in cash and transfer planes and routes to UK sector player Flybe Group Plc (LON:FLYB). Ryanair also agreed to sell Aer Lingus’ London-Gatwick operations to British Airways plc.
This offer represents is Ryanair's third attempt to buy the remaining part of Aer Lingus, after in 2007 the EC
blocked its first bid and in 2009 the company walked away from a second attempt.

Airlines in Europe reporting results for the quarter include the Irish pair  Aer Lingus  and Ryanair. The former marked its most profitable year, at an underlying profit level, since 2007. Restructuring costs, however, dragged down its operating and net profits by half compared with 2011.

Ryanair too enjoyed a bright quarter. It was able to raise its full-year outlook after marginally improving its third quarter result. It was the second consecutive quarter it had increased its full-year guidance, Both point to a picture of improved yields.  Aer Lingus  was able to lift revenue, particularly on long-haul flights, by 8%, despite only fractionally increasing its capacity over the year.

"Revenue growth was delivered through volume and price, and points to the sustainability of the business model," says Aer Lingus chief commercial officer Stephen Kavanagh. "The growth over recent years was sustained and in
2012, we carried more [passengers] than in any year of the business."

Ryanair says its overall outlook improved on a better-than-expected 8% rise in yields in the third quarter. "We didn't expect that price increase of 8%," says Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley, attributing the performance to two key factors.

"Number one, capacity across the whole network, including ourselves, has grown modestly," he says, pointing to capacity reductions from a number of restructuring carriers. Coupled with that, I think there is a growing realisation of the merit of Ryanair's proposition. So many are people coming back to us who have travelled with us before. We are having to compete less and less on price."

While softness in January demand has prompted it to estimate yield growth will return to around 6% during the last quarter of its financial year, that still places a full year profit target of €540 million ($724 million) within its reach. This would be 7% up on its adjusted net profit of €503 million last year and a record for the carrier.

Elsewhere in Europe, Finnair and Icelandair both achieved small full-year profits, the former turning round losses in 2011.

Briefing
Aer Lingus  in for the long-haul

Improved underlying profit and transatlantic growth fuels stand-alone model as Irish rival  Ryanair is blocked again

Aer Lingus's  ability to highlight another year of profit, return to the front foot on growth and increase its dividend for shareholders was aptly timed. After all it underlined its belief in its stand-alone model just as circling rival Ryanair's arguments for a joint future were again failing to convince  European competition regulators.

The Irish airline has been operating against the backdrop of a third acquisition attempt by its feisty rival - and its biggest single shareholder.

Ryanair's latest takeover bid has once again been at the mercy of European competition regulators, after it opened a probe into the proposed takeover.

While a final ruling is still to come, the budget airline has already heard enough from the European Commission to know Brussels once again intends to block it attempts to takeover Aer Lingus on competition grounds.

Unsurprisingly, for an airline that has been on a mission to takeover Aer Lingus since first buying into it in 2006, Ryanair shows very little sign yet of being willing to take no for an answer. It has instructed its lawyers to appeal any prohibition of the deal in the European courts. The story is set to run.
Ryanair argues the decision is "clearly a political one" designed to protect the "narrow, vested interests" of the
Irish government, which holds a 25% stake in Aer Lingus and has publicly opposed Ryanair's attempted takeover.

[The Commission] were very specific about the objections they had, right down to the route," said Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley in January before the Commission decision. "We believe we have addressed every one of these routes. What we are proposing is incredibly radical and unprecedented."

Ryanair's plan centred on commitments by Interntional Airlines Group and Flybe, to take over a large number of Aer Lingus's routes. The former committed to take over divestments of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus's entire London Gatwick operations, and Flybe committed to take over 43 Aer Lingus UK and European routes.

For its part Aer Lingus reiterates its belief that competition concerns would scupper the deal, noting the number of routes out of Ireland which the two carriers compete on has sharply increased since the Commission first blocked a takeover in 2007.

It also points to the UK Competition Commission's ongoing investigations into the possible anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding.

"Ryanair has on a number of occasions attempted to halt this separate investigation, including by means of its third hostile takeover offer," the airline says, adding its position remains that as its largest competitor, Ryanair should be required to divest its shareholding in Aer Lingus.

All of which brings the Aer Lingus model back into focus.Throughout the battle for control of the airline, much of the jockeying from the two carriers has been based on sustainability of the Aer Lingus business model. Ryanair has consistently argued that the deal is the only way to secure Aer Lingus as an Irish carrier focused on Ireland.

Aer Lingus has turned round heavy losses incurred in 2008 and 2009, while keeping Ryanair at bay. Small wonder, then, that it was keen to highlight further progress in unveiling its latest underlying profits increase, even if restructuring costs dented its overall performance at a pre-tax and net level.

Page 112 of 121 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Last year was "stellar" for Aer Lingus, says airline chief executive Christoph Mueller. "Not only have we improved our profitability to almost €70 million ($94 million)," he says, "our operating cash flow has reached 5.4% of our turnover.

"The margin compares very well to the overall competitive landscape in Europe. Our balance sheet is improving and our cash is up, we have gained market share in both long-haul and short-haul. Our business model works, even in the strong recession we experienced in the Irish market."

Mueller took the helm at Aer Lingus in mid-2009, when the carrier was battling for survival. He swiftly aborted some of the carrier's strategic measures - such as its dalliance with a base at London Gatwick - and embarked on its "Greenfield" cost-cutting programme. Three years on, the carrier says that programme has delivered annual savings of more than €100 million, exceeding its €97 million target.
Revenues grew by 8% to €1.3 billion in 2012, despite only a fractional rise in capacity.

"Revenue growth was delivered through volume and price and that points to the sustainability of the business model," says the carrier's chief commercial officer Stephen Kavanagh.

Long-haul in 2012 was "particularly strong", he adds. Revenues were up a fifth to €343 million. "We had a small increase in [capacity], the number of passengers increased significantly and a combination of volume and price delivered an exceptional 17% increase in yield per seat," Kavanagh says.

On the long-haul front the carrier is returning to growth, boosting capacity by 15% this summer through the addition of frequencies on its Boston and Chicago routes. "After three years of cautious capacity development we are returning to growth mode," says Mueller. "The overall capacity increase on the North Atlantic is a huge opportunity."

One of the remaining hurdles for Aer Lingus is the unresolved issues relating to pension deficits, which the carrier estimated at €779 million by the end of December. "We are disappointed that the attempts to find a solution to the pension problem facing us have not yet been successful," Mueller says.

"We strongly believe that the current funding position of the [pension scheme] is unsustainable and that it must be addressed now," he adds.
The carrier's proposals continue to be discussed with its unions in Ireland's Labour Relations Court. "After three years of cautious capacity, we are returning to growth mode"

REFILE-ANALYSIS-EU rebuff won't free Aer Lingus  from Ryanair grip

* EU set to end  Ryanair's seven-year Aer Lingus  pursuit
* Ryanair 30 pct stake gives it grip of rival
* Irish govt may struggle to offload its 25 pct stake
By Conor Humphries
DUBLIN, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The European Commission looks certain to end Ryanair's seven-year pursuit of Aer
Lingus, but Brussels can't stop the low-cost carrier from using its stake to keep its rival in limbo for years.

The Commission, which acts as Europe's anti-monopoly watchdog, has told Ryanair it will reject its 694 million euro ($917 million) bid in an announcement expected on Wednesday.
A veto, which would be the first time it has twice rejected a proposed takeover, could force Ryanair chief Michael
O'Leary to decide whether to finally set its smaller rival free by selling its 30 percent stake.
But if O'Leary follows through on a threat to attempt to become the first company in a decade to overturn an EU
anti-monopoly decision, the process could tie up the stake for years.
It would also likely scare off other strategic investors and stymie the Irish government's efforts to offload its own
25 percent stake - part of a package of privatisations required by its 85 billion euro EU-IMF bailout.

"The government and Aer Lingus will simply have to wait and see what Ryanair chooses to do," said analyst David Holohan at brokerage Merrion Capital. "Until the Ryanair process is completed, I think the government will struggle to find a buyer."

Aer Lingus, long since eclipsed in terms of the number of passengers carried by its budget rival, has made no secret of its wish to remove Ryanair from its share registry, arguing Ryanair uses its 30 percent shareholding to disrupt and distract its one significant competitor on the Irish market.

Dropping Ryanair would also clear the way for an investment by a large industry investor with deep pockets, like minority shareholder Etihad, or boost the company's "free float" of readily tradeable shares, which Aer Lingus believes would help lift its share price.

Yet if O'Leary decides to appeal, Aer Lingus' best hope may be a probe by Britain's Competition Commission into whether the Ryanair holding distorts competition in the UK market.

The investigation has been delayed by the European probe and even if it is restarted, Ryanair could likely use appeal processes to delay a final decision for more than a year.

The threat of being forced to sell could put pressure on Ryanair to sell its stake sooner. But having already written down the 407 million euros it paid for the stake in 2007-2009 to 80 million, it may feel it has some leeway given current prices valuing it at around 200 million euros.
IRELAND WAITS

The Irish government has maintained a wait-and-see approach to its stake as the probe proceeds, hiring consultants to provide market intelligence ahead of a possible sale, but has not yet launched a public tender for financial and legal advisors.
"We will sell the stake at the right time at the right price and under the right conditions," Transport Minister Leo
Varadkar told Reuters last week. "I don't feel any pressure."

Equally, a decision forcing Ryanair to sell its stake would "open up all kinds of opportunities" for the government's stake, Varadkar said.

The two carriers linked to the stake are British Airways parent ICAG - whose chief Willie Walsh used to run Aer Lingus and which offered to take over some Aer Lingus routes as part of Ryanair's bid - and Abu Dhabi carrier Etihad.

Etihad has said it may be interested in increasing its 3 percent stake, while ICAG's Walsh has said he would not be interested. Both companies declined comment when asked if the EU commission decision might change their mind.

Ryanair's other option would be to target institutional investors keen to get exposure to one of Europe's few profitable airlines, with operating profit of 69.1 million euros in 2012, up 40 percent from last year.
Even if Ryanair decides to offload Aer Lingus, the latter's management still needs to address a deficit of around
500 million euros in a shared pension scheme associated with current and former Aer Lingus staff.

Aer Lingus, whose market capitalisation is 668 million euros, says it has no legal obligation to make good the deficit, but the threat of legal and industrial action has kept it at the negotiating table.
The airline and unions have said they hope for a deal within months.

"Until the pension issue is resolved, we suspect that prospective suitors will be cautious," said Gerard Moore, an analyst at brokerage NCB. ($1 = 0.7567 euros)

MERGERS : RYANAIR-AER LINGUS DECISION ON 27 FEBRUARY

The European Commission will announce its decision on Ryanair's friendly takeover bid on  Aer Lingus,  the other Irish airline in which it holds a 29.82% stake (see Europolitics 4585), on 27 February. The low-cost company's third bid may well end with the same outcome as its earlier tries.

Due to concerns that duplicate routes between  Ryanair and Aer Lingus  may shut out real and potential competition on these routes, the Commission opened an in-depth investigation (second phase) on 29 August
2012 (4475). To address its concerns,  Ryanair announced, on 5 November 2012, that it had submitted "unprecedented remedies" to the executive. It revealed that these concessions would enable other airlines to acquire the Irish airlines' crossover routes, in return for which it would give up  Aer Lingus  landing slots at London's Gatwick Airport (4521).

On 12 February, after a meeting with the EU executive, Ryanair announced in the media that the transaction would be rejected in spite of the concessions it had proposed. It maintained that the Commission was taking a biased approach and that holds it to a higher standard than other airlines (4585 and 4586).

In June 2007, the Commission rejected Ryanair's first bid on Aer Lingus. The low-cost airline appealed the decision, but the EU General Court sided with the executive, ruling that the decision banning the deal was valid. The court also rejected the Aer Lingus application for a court order to force Ryanair to divest itself of its minority share. In 2010, Ryanair decided on its own to abandon its second takeover attempt.

The European Commission said Wednesday it had barred, for a third time, low-cost airline pioneer  Ryanair from taking over its Irish rival  Aer Lingus  due to concerns passengers would lose out.

The "merger would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 46 routes ... this would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers," the Commission said in a statement.

EU bars Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus

The European Commission said Wednesday it had barred a third attempt by low-cost airline pioneer  Ryanair to take over its Irish rival  Aer Lingus  due to concerns passengers would lose out.

The "merger would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 46 routes ... this would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers," the Commission said in a statement.

It said Ryanair offered several remedies to meet these competition concerns but they "fell short" of what was needed.

Ryanair's proposals "were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in the statement.

Industry consolidation was welcome "so long as it is not at the expense of consumers," Almunia told a press conference, citing a series of recent Commission airline merger approvals.
Ryanair tried in 2007 to take control of Aer Lingus, in which the Irish government holds some 25 percent, but the
Commission prohibited that deal on competition grounds.
The company tried again in 2009 but decided to withdraw when it became clear Brussels remained opposed. During the attempted takeovers Ryanair built up a 30 percent stake in Aer Lingus and offered to buy out the Irish
government which has consistently refused to sell.

Changes since 2007 have only reinforced the two airlines' position in the Irish market, the Commission said, adding that the proposed deal would "have removed the currently vibrant competition between" them.

"In short, customers' travelling options would have been substantially reduced and it is unlikely that competitors would have been able to sufficiently constrain the merged entity in its market behaviour. Higher prices for passengers would have been the likely outcome."

Ryanair said earlier this month that it expected to be turned down again in Brussels, and reaffirmed Wednesday it would appeal while lambasting the Commission's reasoning as politically motivated.
"Ryanair today confirmed that it will appeal the EU Commission's announced decision to prohibit its latest offer for
Aer Lingus," it said.
The company insisted that its remedies addressed EU concerns.
"Ryanair's latest remedies package conclusively addressed all of the objections raised by the Commission" in
2007 and in its latest 2012 application for clearance, it added.

Aer Lingus, which has repeatedly snubbed Ryanair and argues that it is a strong standalone airline, welcomed the ruling and said it was the first time the EU had rejected a takeover deal twice.

Ryanair says will appeal against EU takeover decision

Irish low-cost airline  Ryanair on Wednesday said it would appeal against the  European Commission's decision to block its third attempt to take over rival carrier  Aer Lingus,  which welcomed the rejection.

"Ryanair today confirmed that it will appeal the  EU Commission's announced decision to prohibit its latest offer for Aer Lingus,"  it said in a statement that also slammed what it called a "political" decision.

The EC formally blocked the takeover on Wednesday, arguing that it would have harmed consumers by reducing choice and creating a monopoly or dominant position on 46 routes.
Ryanair insisted that it had submitted a remedies package that addressed the EU's concerns.

"Ryanair delivered a structural divestment remedy including, not one, but two upfront buyers, irrevocable and binding commitments from those two upfront buyers, divestiture of Aer Lingus' flights in each of the 46 crossover routes, together with offers of slot divestitures for an unlimited period of time on all other potential competition routes," it added in the statement.
"Ryanair's latest remedies package conclusively addressed all of the objections raised by the Commission in its
2007 prohibition decision, and comprehensively resolved all of the competition issues raised by the Commission
in its November 2012 statement of objections."

Aer Lingus, which has repeatedly snubbed Ryanair and argues that it is a strong standalone airline, applauded the latest EC ruling.
"Aer Lingus Group plc welcomes the decision announced today by the European Commission (EC) prohibiting
Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus," it said.

"This is the first occasion on which the EC has needed to block the same deal twice. It is also Ryanair's third failed offer for Aer Lingus."

Ryanair owns 30 percent of Aer Lingus and last July offered to buy the Irish government's 25.1-percent stake in the airline, but Dublin has stood firm and had already announced that it would not sell.

EU turns down Ryanair again on Aer Lingus  takeover

The European Commission on Wednesday barred a third attempt by low-cost airline pioneer  Ryanair to take over its Irish rival  Aer Lingus,  citing concerns passengers would lose out badly.

Ryanair immediately said it would appeal, lambasting the decision as politically motivated and insisting its proposed remedies to competition problems were not given due weight.

The "merger would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 46 routes ... this would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers," the Commission said in a statement.

Ryanair's remedies "were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in the statement.
The Commission said Ryanair offered to divest Aer Lingus operations on 43 overlap routes to Flybe, the
UK-based no-frills carrier. It would also cede slots at London airports to British Airways on three key routes -- to
Dublin, Shannon and Cork, with other London-Ireland slots also on offer.

However, the Commission said a review showed that Flybe "was not a suitable purchaser capable of competing sufficiently with the Ryanair/Aer Lingus merged entity."

At the same time, it appeared British Airways would not impact competition enough and would have "little incentive to stay on the routes beyond a three year period."

Industry consolidation was welcome "so long as it is not at the expense of consumers," Almunia told a press conference, citing a series of recent Commission airline merger approvals.
Ryanair tried in 2007 to take control of Aer Lingus, in which the Irish government holds some 25 percent, but the
Commission prohibited that deal on competition grounds.

The company tried again in 2009 but decided to withdraw when it became clear Brussels and Dublin remained opposed.

During the attempted takeovers, Ryanair built up a 30 percent stake in Aer Lingus and offered to buy out the Irish government which has consistently refused to sell.

Changes to the airline business since 2007 have only reinforced the two airlines' position in the Irish market, the Commission said, adding that the proposed deal would "have removed the currently vibrant competition between" them.

Ryanair said earlier this month that it expected to be turned down again by Brussels and reaffirmed Wednesday it plans to appeal the decision.
"Ryanair today confirmed that it will appeal the EU Commission's announced decision to prohibit its latest offer for
Aer Lingus," it said in a statement, insisting that its remedies did address EU concerns.

"It is untenable for the Commission to argue on competition grounds why they have rejected what is an unprecedented and revolutionary remedies package," it said, noting the EU's recent approval for British Airways parent company IAG to takeover BMI.

"It is clear that Ryanair, as Europe’s only ultra-low cost airline, is being held to a different and considerably higher standard by the European Commission than any other EU flag carrier airline," it charged.

The rejection of the remedies package amounted to "pandering to the narrow (and misguided) political interests of the Irish government," it said.

A travel sector analyst in Ireland said he believed that Ryanair probably felt it stood a better chance going to court with its appeal but there was "absolutely" no support for the deal in the country.

"The politicians are against it. The consumers are against it. The workforce is against it. Business groups have voiced opinion against it. There really isn’t a level of support for it," the analyst said.

Irish Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said the Commission's decision supported "the government’s view that a merger would be bad for competition."

Aer Lingus, which has repeatedly snubbed Ryanair and argues that it is a strong standalone airline, welcomed the ruling and said it was the first time the EU had rejected a takeover deal twice.
