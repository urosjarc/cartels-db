No additional concessions for Deutsche Boerse merger:  NYSE

NEW YORK: A senior executive of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) said it would not make further concessions to secure approval by  European Union regulators of its planned  merger with German stock market operator Deutsche Boerse.

"We won t go any further because that threatens the business logic of the deal,"  NYSE Euronext deputy chief executive Dominique Cerutti told the French business daily La Tribune.
NYSE chief executive Duncan Niederauer acknowledged on Thursday that it appeared the European
Commission was set to reject the plans to create the world s biggest stock exchange group, although he said they
had received no formal notification.
A person familiar with the EU review said on Tuesday that the proposed merger as it stands was unacceptable. EU competition authorities opened a probe into the deal in August over concerns that the merged company would
control 90 per cent of the European derivatives market.
Competitors

In November the companies proposed to separate some of their derivatives operations to allay EU concerns, but sources said the commission was unsatisfied.

Niederauer insisted that the commission s call for NYSE and Deutsche Boerse to sell off some of their derivatives businesses to allay competition concerns was unfounded and based on flawed analyses.

Cerutti was quoted as saying in yesterday's edition of La Tribune that commission experts had made their analyses 'based on erroneous data'. He also noted that the Commission had consulted their direct competitors about the planned merger.

"They also questioned numerous banks which are at the same time our clients and competitors, and they obviously oppose our project," he said.

Deutsche Boerse, Nyse make last push to save deal

Have so many ever done so much to accomplish so little?

That might be the sentiment of major shareholders of  NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Boerse if European regulators squash the mega-merger of the two exchanges. The exchanges announced the roughly $17 billion deal last February. If approved, it would create the world's largest stock and derivatives exchange.

Indeed, the proposal dominated industry headlines even amid the ongoing roll out of Dodd-Frank financial reform in the United States and the rippling effects of financial crises. It even survived a heated campaign that saw rival exchange IntercontinentalExchange offer a financially superior bid for NYSE Euronext that would have swept it out from under the German rival.

However, the regulatory winds have decidedly shifted in recent weeks, and it now appears the would-be deal is doomed to become an industry historical footnote.

Reportedly, the antitrust arm of the European Commission has recommended that the full body block the merger, partially on the presumption that the OTC markets don't provide a competitive offset to the exchange-traded derivatives business.
The full commission is expected to vote on the merger by Feb. 9.

That leaves just a few weeks for representatives of both exchanges to make one final push for the nearly year-long effort to make the two massive financial institutions one. If European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso were not already intimately familiar with the pleas of NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer and Deutsche Boerse CEO Reto Francioni that the deal makes sense for a Europe struggling with broader financial volatility, he will be soon.
A year's worth of effort -- and countless billable hours -- hang in the balance.

Giant Deutsche Boerse-NYSE merger heads for rocks

The merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which would create the world's largest market operator worth over $17 billion (14 billion euros), looks seriously compromised just weeks from an  EU competition decision.

With European anti-trust services setting conditions deemed unacceptable by executives, there is a growing chance that the tie-up putting the New York Stock Exchange under the same roof as the German market operator will fall apart.

A senior executive of NYSE Euronext -- which also operates markets in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon -- said it would not make additional concessions to secure approval by the European Commission.

"We won't go any further because that threatens the business logic of the deal," NYSE Euronext deputy chief executive Dominique Cerutti told the French business daily La Tribune on Friday.

NYSE chief executive Duncan Niederauer had already acknowledged that it appeared the European Commission was set to reject the plans come a February 9 deadline for its decision, almost one year after the deal was first announced.
But he said they had received no formal notification.

In a video message to employees, Niederauer said of the anticipated rejection: "If that's true, I would have to say that's a pretty disappointing conclusion."

A person familiar with the EU review told AFP earlier in the week that the proposed merger as it stands was unacceptable.

EU competition authorities opened a probe into the deal in August over concerns that the merged company would control 90 percent of the European derivatives market.

In November the companies proposed to separate some of their derivatives operations to allay EU concerns, but sources said the Commission was unsatisfied.
"It is not certain the Commission could accept" the merger in its current state, added the source.

The Commission wanted NYSE and Deutsche Boerse to sell off some of their derivatives businesses to allay competition concerns, which Cerutti said was a position "based on erroneous data."
The proposed merger has also sparked controversy in the United States because it would hand over the New
York Stock Exchange to foreign owners.

The merger would see Deutsche Boerse shareholders own 60 percent of the new combined, Netherlands-incorporated firm.
The US Justice Department said in December that Deutsche Boerse would have to sell its 31.5 percent stake in
Direct Edge Holdings, the fourth-largest exchange operator in the United States.

Deutsche Boerse-NYSE Merger Looks Unlikely

Brussels. The  merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which would create the world’s largest market operator, worth more than $17 billion, looks seriously compromised just weeks from an  EU competition decision.

EU sets out case against NYSE-DB
1,187 words
15 January 2012
FOI
FOW
English
(c) 2012. Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC.
Here is the EU statement on the rejection of the  Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronextmerger:

The European Commission has prohibited, on the basis of the  EU Merger Regulation, the proposed  merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, as it would have resulted in a quasi-monopoly in the area of European financial derivatives traded globally on exchanges. Together, the two exchanges control more than
90% of global trade in these products.

The Commission's investigation showed that new competitors would be unlikely to enter the market successfully enough to pose a credible competitive threat to the merged company. The companies offered, in particular, to sell certain assets and to provide access to their clearinghouse for some categories of new contracts, but overall, the commitments were inadequate to solve the identified competition concerns.

Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "The merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide. These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive. We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns."

Eurex, operated by Deutsche Börse, and Liffe, operated by NYSE Euronext, are the two largest exchanges in the world for financial derivatives based on European underlyings. They compete head-to-head and are each other's closest competitors.

The proposed merger would have eliminated this global competition and created a quasi-monopoly in a number of asset classes, leading to significant harm to derivatives users and the European economy as a whole. With no effective competitive constraint left in the market, the benefits of price competition would be taken away from customers. There would also be less innovation in an area where a competitive market is vital for both SMEs and larger firms.
Summary of the Commission's conclusions
1. Relevant market

The Commission's analysis focused on the effects of the proposed merger on the markets for European financial derivatives (European interest rate, single stock equity and equity index derivatives) traded on exchanges. It did not identify any significant competition issues in other areas, such as cash listing, trading and post-trading activities.

Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset (e.g. interest rate, equity). They are used by companies and financial institutions to manage financial risk. They are also used as an investment vehicle by retail and institutional investors – including mutual and pension funds investing on behalf of final consumers. See MEMO/12/60

Derivatives can be traded on exchanges or "over-the-counter" (OTC). Exchange-traded derivatives (ETDs) are highly liquid, relatively small size (around €100 000 per trade) and fully standardised contracts in all their legal
and economic terms and conditions. In contrast, OTC derivatives typically concern much bigger contracts (around
€200 000 000 per trade) that allow customisation of their legal and economic terms and conditions. The
investigation showed that ETDs and OTCs are generally not considered as substitutes by customers, since they
use them for different purposes and in different circumstances. Some users of exchanges are also not authorised
by their mandates to operate in the OTC market due to risk management considerations.
2. Near monopoly on European financial derivatives traded on exchanges


Page 10 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Eurex, operated by Deutsche Börse, and Liffe, operated by NYSE Euronext, are the two largest exchanges in the world for financial derivatives based on European underlyings. They compete head-to-head and are each other's closest competitors.

The proposed merger would have eliminated this global competition and created a quasi-monopoly in a number of asset classes, leading to significant harm to derivatives users and the European economy as a whole. With no effective competitive constraint left in the market, the benefits of price competition would be taken away from customers. There would also be less innovation in an area where a competitive market is vital for both SMEs and larger firms.

Although other companies, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), provide similar services worldwide, they only do so marginally in the asset classes concerned. The investigation showed that due to the high barriers to entry, no other player would be able to develop trading in European financial derivatives on a sufficient scale to keep the market competitive.

Both Eurex and Liffe operate closed vertical silos linking their exchange to their own clearing house. The merger would have resulted in a single vertical silo, trading and clearing more than 90% of the global market of European financial ETDs. It would have been difficult for a new player to enter the market because given the advantages of clearing similar contracts in a single clearing house, customers would have been reluctant to trade similar derivatives at another exchange. Therefore, the dynamics of the market would have reinforced the monopolistic position of the merger thus resulting in higher prices and lower incentives to innovate.

The two companies claimed that the merger would benefit customers through greater liquidity. However, it is unlikely that the merger would directly yield such benefits. Historically, competition - rather than exchange consolidation - has generated liquidity gains.
The companies also argued that customers would benefit from having to post less collateral for security.
However, these benefits would be significantly less than argued by the merging companies and they could in part
be achieved without the merger.

In any case, any efficiencies would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the merger. Because of the creation of a near monopoly, any benefits would also be unlikely to be fully passed on to customers.
3. Remedies proposed by the two companies

The two companies offered in particular to sell Liffe's European single stock equity derivatives products where these compete with Eurex. However, the divested assets would be too small and not diversified enough to be viable on a stand-alone basis.

In the commercially more significant area of European interest rate derivatives, the companies did not offer to sell overlapping derivatives products, but only offered to provide access to the merged company's clearing for some categories of "new" contracts. This was considered as insufficient, in particular because it did not extend to existing competing products. There were also fundamental concerns about the workability and the effectiveness
of such an access remedy.

The Commission, therefore, had no alternative but to conclude that the concentration "would significantly impede effective competition in the internal market or a substantial part of it" (Art 2.3 of the Merger Regulation) and prohibited the transaction.

Wide support for NYSE-DB verdict
463 words
15 January 2012
FOI
FOW

(c) 2012. Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC.
There has been widespread support for the  EU's decision to block the  NYSE Euronextmerger with Deutsche
Börse.

Reaction from investors was equally swift with a lift in share price for both exchanges.  NYSE Euronext was upgraded by research analysts at RBC Capital and Credit Agricole.

The Association for Financial Markets in Europe said the failure by the exchanges to offer significant concessions had been critical for other exchanges.

Christian Krohn, a managing director at the Association for Financial Market in Europe, said: "AFME has previously stated that the test of any exchange merger will be whether or not it brings benefits to the exchanges' customers. In the case of the DB1-NYX transaction, those potential benefits were undermined by serious competition concerns.

"Unfortunately, the remedies offered by the parties did not go far enough to address those concerns, so, after a comprehensive inquiry, we believe that the Commission has reached the correct decision in rejecting the merger proposal which would otherwise have led to the creation of a quasi-monopoly in the European exchange-traded derivatives market."

The chief executive of ICAP, Michael Spencer, said the deal was not in Europe's interests: "That deal was very appropriately rejected by the Competition Commission because it would have created a monopoly in Europe in financial futures similar to the monopoly that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has in the US And I don't believe we should be in the business of providing monopolies or allowing monopolies to be created."
The view was echoed across the sector as both exchanges reviewed their next moves.

Seth Merrin, chief executive of Liquidnet, the global institutional trading network said: "As well as competition issues there's a feeling from investors that the merger is an answer to a question which they aren’t asking. It looks good for the exchanges but brings nothing to institutional investors.

"They want greater liquidity and the ability to execute their investment decisions. For that, exchanges need to give their clients access to additional sources of liquidity. They won't be able to achieve that by merging amongst themselves."

Attention has now focused on the negotiations between the London Stock Exchange and LCH.Clearnet which could be the subject of a late alternative bid from NYSE Euronext.

Re-shaping  the post-merger derivatives landscape
773 words

New mergers will be on the cards for  Europe’s derivatives markets this year, but they are likely to be of a smaller scale than the mega-mergers proposed over the last 12 months.

A key driver for derivatives exchange consolidation was removed on 1 February when transatlantic market operator NYSE Euronext, and Germany’s trading infrastructure firm Deutsche Börse, announced that the European Commission (EC) was prohibiting their  merger.

“Anything else big is likely to draw the same ruling from the European Commission,” says Fred Ponzo, founder and managing partner, at consultancy GreySpark Partners.
“Effectively they have put a stop to large mergers in Europe.”

The deal’s failure has created something of a power vacuum. Other venues will now try to expand through partnership deals, making themselves too big to be a target for either protagonist and to expand their own mix of revenues.

The biggest in a spate of proposed cross-border exchange mergers, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse had threatened to create derivatives giant.

The move coincided with regulatory moves to legislate for over-the-counter trading to be centrally cleared, with much pushed on exchange.

Deutsche Börse’s derivatives trading venue and clearing house Eurex, together with NYSE Liffe, would have combined the dominant European trading venues into a central clearer.
The result would effectively offer a one-stop shop for the majority of trading in the region.

In August 2011, as part of its investigation into the proposed merger, the EC said that the deal would in essence “remove a strong competitor from the market and would give the merged company by far the leading position in derivatives trading in Europe.”

It said it was also concerned that the tie-up would create an inability for other firms to access the post-trade infrastructure.

In preventing it, the EC has left two giants walking away empty handed. NYSE Euronext has been left in the worse position of the two, according to Peter Lenardos, analyst at broker RBC Europe.

In a note published on 31 January, he asserted that Deutsche Börse has a more diversified business, with less reliance on cash trading.

“In 2011, NYSE Euronext should generate 64% of its revenue from cash markets, and 89% of its revenue from cash markets and derivatives,” he said.

“Deutsche Börse should generate just 13% of its revenue from cash markets, and 55% of its revenue from cash markets and derivatives.”

Rival venues have also had a worrying 12 months. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) has been frantically developing its own derivatives franchise to fight the combined threat, and although it has passed, the firm still need to broaden its income stream.

New targets may quickly be acquired by Deutsche Börse and NYSE. According to Ponzo, the German firm is likely to focus on expanding Eastern Europe while NYSE will need to make up its operational shortcomings.

The London Metal Exchange has confirmed it will be reviewing bids from over 10 interested parties at a meeting of its board on 23 February.

The firms that have made expressions of interest include the LSE and NYSE Euronext, according to industry sources; neither exchange offered comment on these rumours.
Firm bids from all interested parties will be received a week before the meeting.

The Anglo-French clearing house LCH.Clearnet is also a takeover target, having confirmed that it entered exclusive talks with the LSE on 27 September 2011.

LCH.CLearnet has previously rejected a bid from derivative evaluation firm Markit, in a move which was supported by NYSE Euronext.

Clearing infrastructure will be imperative for any exchange wishing to maximise its revenues from the soon-to-be expanding derivatives business, as will the ability to create new products.
NYSE Euronext had announced it would build its own clearing house prior to the merger announcement with
Deutsche Börse; if LCH.Clearnet is off the table that project may be rekindled.
Takeovers that support this level of organic growth are seen as the most credible option.

Goldman Sachs analysts issued a note on 1 February which said, “We expect exchanges to pursue acquisitions that are more modest, and less transformative, in scale.
“The recent acquisition of 50% of the FTSE index business by LSE is a good example of this.” Dan Barnes

Deutsche Boerse, NYSE make last push to save deal

Have so many ever done so much to accomplish so little?

That might be the sentiment of major shareholders of  NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Boerse if European regulators squash the mega-merger of the two exchanges. The exchanges announced the roughly $17 billion deal last February. If approved, it would create the world's largest stock and derivatives exchange.

Indeed, the proposal dominated industry headlines even amid the ongoing roll out of Dodd-Frank financial reform in the United States and the rippling effects of financial crises. It even survived a heated campaign that saw rival exchange IntercontinentalExchange offer a financially superior bid for NYSE Euronext that would have swept it out from under the German rival.

However, the regulatory winds have decidedly shifted in recent weeks, and it now appears the would-be deal is doomed to become an industry historical footnote.

Reportedly, the antitrust arm of the European Commission has recommended that the full body block the merger, partially on the presumption that the OTC markets don't provide a competitive offset to the exchange-traded derivatives business.
The full commission is expected to vote on the merger by Feb. 9.

That leaves just a few weeks for representatives of both exchanges to make one final push for the nearly year-long effort to make the two massive financial institutions one. If European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso were not already intimately familiar with the pleas of NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer and Deutsche Boerse CEO Reto Francioni that the deal makes sense for a Europe struggling with broader financial volatility, he will be soon.
A year's worth of effort -- and countless billable hours -- hang in the balance.

NYSE-Deutsche tie-up deal looks set to unravel

THE merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which would create the world’s largest market operator worth over US$17 billion (S$22 billion), looks seriously compromised just weeks from a  European Union competition decision.

With European anti-trust services setting conditions deemed unacceptable by executives, there is a growing chance that the tie-up putting the New York Stock Exchange under the same roof as the German market operator will fall apart.
A senior executive of NYSE Euronext – which also operates markets in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon –
said it would not make additional concessions to secure approval by the European Commission.

“We won’t go any further because that threatens the business logic of the deal,” NYSE Euronext deputy chief executive Dominique Cerutti told the French business daily La Tribune last Friday.

NYSE chief executive Duncan Niederauer had already acknowledged that it appeared the European Commission was set to reject the plans come a Feb 9 deadline for its decision, almost one year after the deal was first announced.
But he said they had received no formal notification.

In a video message to employees, Mr Niederauer said of the anticipated rejection: “If that’s true, I would have to say that’s a pretty disappointing conclusion.”

A person familiar with the EU review told AFP earlier last week that the proposed merger as it stands was unacceptable.

The EU competition authorities opened a probe into the deal in August over concerns that the merged company would control 90 per cent of the European derivatives market.

In November, the companies proposed to separate some of their derivatives operations to allay EU concerns, but sources said the commission was unsatisfied.
“It is not certain the commission could accept” the merger in its current state, added the source. AFP

Deutsche Boerse, Nyse seek EU commissioners support for merger - report

(SeeNews) - Jan 17, 2012 - Reto Francioni, CEO of Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) and Duncan Niederauer, CEO of Nyse Euronext (NYSE:NYX) have sent a letter to EU commissioners stressing the "European" nature of a merger in a bid to secure regulatory approval for the deal.

The two executives wrote in the letter, cited by Reuters, that the company which will emerge from the deal will generate 70% of its revenues in the  EU.
The merger will make it easier for the EU to effectively introduce its financial market regulations, they wrote. Francioni and Niederauer called on the EU to take into consideration not only the European derivatives market in
a drive to calm down concerns that the merger will stifle competition there. There will be enough competition after
the deal because of the over-the-counter derivatives trading and big sector players such as CME, Francioni and
Niederauer said.
Earlier, insiders had said that EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia planned to block the deal. A
decision of the EU regulator is expected by February 9.

EU anti-trust chief insists trading  exchanges  stay 'fair'

EU competition chief Joaquin Almunia said Tuesday that financial markets must remain "fair, efficient and therefore competitive," as he spoke of a looming decision on the endangered  merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext.

"Exchanges are a crucial instrument for modern and efficient capital markets," Almunia was to tell a Brussels audience according to the text of a speech released in advance. "And for this reason, competition between exchanges is needed."

Making reference to the planned merger, which company leaders and EU sources have hinted is unlikely to get a green light, he said simply "our decision will be adopted soon."

The European Commission is counting down towards a February 9 deadline on what would create, if passed, the world's largest market operator worth over $17 billion (14 billion euros).

Almunia said the Commission "will seek to ensure that European markets remain fair, efficient and therefore competitive to the advantage of their users," adding that "competitive markets are the best way to incubate globally successful firms."

A senior NYSE Euronext executive said last week said they would not make additional concessions to secure approval by the Commission of the tie-up that would put the New York Stock Exchange under the same roof as the German market operator.
A person familiar with the EU review told AFP last week that the proposed merger as it stands was unacceptable. EU competition authorities opened a probe into the deal in August over concerns that the merged company would

E.U. competition chief Joaquin Almunia noted the E.U. had raised concerns around the planned  merger of NYSE

"By now all of you are aware that the European Commission has raised preliminary concerns in the announced merger between two large exchanges in the E.U., and it has launched an in-depth investigation that is still ongoing," said Almunia.

Almunia added "in this case as in others, the Commission will seek to ensure that European markets remain fair, efficient and therefore competitive to the advantage of their users."

The E.U. case team examining the $17 billion combination last week recommended the E.U. block the deal, on the grounds it would create a monopoly in exchange-traded futures and options contracts. Together NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse are estimated to control approximately 93% of such business, though their total has been noted to be smaller than the much-larger market in derivatives traded off exchanges.

EU Competition Chief Shares His View on Exchange Tie-Up

The head of the  European Union's competition watchdog said Tuesday that competition among financial exchanges is necessary as the  EU prepares to deliver a decision on the proposed  merger of Europe's two biggest market operators.

European Union competition chief Joaquin Almunia noted the  EU had raised concerns around the planned
merger of NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Börse AG and would make a decision on the case soon.

"By now all of you are aware that the European Commission has raised preliminary concerns in the announced merger between two large exchanges in the EU, and it has launched an in-depth investigation that is still ongoing," Mr. Almunia said.

"Exchanges are a crucial instrument for modern and efficient capital markets," Mr. Almunia said, speaking at an event in Brussels. "And for this reason, competition between exchanges is needed."

The EU case team examining the $17 billion combination last week recommended that the European Commission block the deal, on the grounds it would create a monopoly in exchange-traded futures and options contracts. Together, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are estimated to control 93% of such business.

The companies had argued that their two derivatives markets mostly don't compete, as they offer differing slates of contracts, and both companies' products compete with the larger market in derivatives traded off exchanges, such as swaps.

Executives of the exchange groups haven't given up hope for salvaging their deal and now are speaking directly to EU commissioners, who are expected to debate the matter on Feb. 1.

NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer on Tuesday met with commissioners including Viviane Reding, describing ways that the combination would benefit market superivision and ease collateral costs for European banks.
Overturning a recommendation by the EU competition watchdog is uncommon, however, occurring in only about
10% of mergers that prompted an in-depth review. Investors and analysts believe that the deal ultimately is likely
to be blocked by the European Union.

Separately, a committee of antitrust regulators representing EU member nations on Tuesday backed the findings of the EU team that examined the Deutsche Börse-NYSE deal, according to a Reuters report. That panel's opinion is nonbinding for the broader EU decision on whether to approve the deal.

National regulators in the European Union backed plans by the region's top antitrust official to block the  merger of Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext, according to a person with knowledge of Tuesday's vote. Representatives of national competition agencies supported the  European Commission's proposed  merger ban, the person said.

The commission isn't obliged to follow the advice of the officials from the 27-nation bloc.  EU regulators have told the two companies they plan to veto the deal to create the world's largest exchange because it would monopolize derivatives trading in the region. The  EU's Competition Commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, left, said the
Brussels-based authority will decide on the deal on Feb. 1. Companies can appeal a  merger ban at the  EU
courts.

A has told Reuters that EU competition regulators have endorsed a recommendation that the  EU block the Deutsche Boerse/NYSE merger.

10:09 (Dow Jones) Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF) CEO Reto Francioni says the company's planned merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX), which hangs by a thread as  EU antitrust officials have recommended blocking the deal, would improve regulators' ability to police markets by consolidating more operations under  EU jurisdiction and funneling more trading into a single clearing and settlement facility.

10:09 (Dow Jones) They aren't partying in the streets, but homebuilders are feeling cheerier lately than during recession. Trade group NAHB's builder sentiment index rises for fourth straight month, to 25 in January, better than 21 in December and 22 expected. But keep in mind, index has to be above 50 to signal more builders view conditions as good rather than poor. They're only halfway there. (kathleen.madigan@dowjones.com)

10:02 (Dow Jones) JPMorgan muses Target (TGT) likely suspended the sale of its credit-card receivables because of price, and the move could increase the desire for certain investors to "throw in the towel." There had been patience in 2H as TGT lost several executives and holiday sales were lackluster. But the patience of value investors, in particular, could be wearing thin, says JPMorgan. TGT is off 1.8% at $49.01, putting the month's drop at 4.3%. (karen.talley@dowjones.com)

10:02 (Dow Jones) JC Penney (JCP) faces "significant risk to near-term sales and margins" if its new pricing approach isn't executed well, BMO Capital Markets says. The firm's referring to JCP's plan to move from a "complex/costly high-low" promotional approach to a less complex everyday low value direction. The
much-anticipated unveiling of the plan will come Jan 25 and, according to employees, be deployed in February under the hand of new CEO Ron Johnson. BMO says "a material number" of loyal customers prefer promotional pricing, so the new strategy needs to be implemented gradually so it won't "alienate and confuse" the core customer. JCP up 1.2% at $33.68. (karen.talley@dowjones.com)

9:58 (Dow Jones) RBC Dominion notes while BankUnited (BKU) would catapult Toronto-Dominion's (TD) TD Bank to the No. 6 spot in Florida by deposits from its current No. 10 if it buys BKU, there likely won't be a notable impact on TD's EPS. BKU has $11B in assets versus TD's $686B, while expected 2012 profit is $145M compared to TD's C$6.7B. TD declined to comment. TD is down fractionally while BKU is off 1.7% as the bank has apparently gotten fewer takeover bids than it expected. (caroline.vanhasselt@dowjones.com)

9:50 (Dow Jones) Linear Tech's (LLTC) upbeat F2Q EPS and strong guidance isn't boosting just its shares, one of the strongest in the S&P 500. That as analysts say LLTC's news may well be an anomaly. Canaccord continues to expect estimate cuts for the analog-chip group, but it believes investors are now more confident that the inventory correction may end soon. Meanwhile, Susquehanna doesn't "expect other analog companies to guide to similar strength for 1Q, but even for those semi companies for which 4Q is not the bottom, LLTC's commentary provides encouragement that the bottom is close for the analog group as a whole." LLTC is up 7% while Fairchild (FCS) jumps 9% as Analog Devices (ADI), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Maxim (MXIM) all gain
5%. (shara.tibken@dowjones.com)

9:49 (Dow Jones) JPMorgan's weekly client survey showed Treasury investors shifting into neutral mode, and away from shorts. Neutral positioning increased by two percentage points to 68% while bets against the market fell by two to 13%. This highlights the current struggle of the Treasury market, with yields unable to break decisively in either direction. Europe's debt crisis is preventing investors for fully discarding Treasurys, while improving US data leaves buyers at risk of a sudden snap-up in yields. (cynthia.lin@dowjones.com)

9:44 (Dow Jones) Moody's slaps a one-notch downgrade on California tax-allocation bonds rated Baa2 and above, affecting $11.6B of debt. Firm says its action reflects "near-term cash flow risks" arising from recently upheld state legislation that dissolves all redevelopment agencies that issue this type of debt. Starting Feb. 1, each redevelopment agency will be replaced by a "successor agency" charged with winding down affairs, including payment of existing debt, Moody's says. But firm warns, "the implementation and potential for varying interpretations of the new legislation incrementally raises the risk that some debt service payments will not be made on a timely basis." (kelly.nolan@dowjones.com)

9:43 (Dow Jones) Hasbro (HAS) and Walt Disney's (DIS) Marvel are expanding their line of superhero products this year as the toy maker aims to benefit from the launch of two high-profile studio releases this year--"The Avengers," due to hit theaters in May and July's "The Amazing Spider-Man." Some toys will debut next month at the American International Toy Fair. The move comes at an good time for HAS, which has seen weakened demand in North America but strong growth abroad. HAS gave a 4Q revenue warning Tuesday. (john.kell@dowjones.com)

9:40 (Dow Jones) It's still early, but this earnings season is on track to be sub-par, even considering that the Street lowered the bar with a slew of forecast cuts. Of 35 S&P 500 4Q reports, just under half have beat earnings expectations, vs the full-quarter average of 70% in last four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters. Caveat is that banks tend to report early, which may be suppressing the figure, not to mention most investors want bigger sample size before drawing their conclusions. But weak performance is in keeping with last few months' spate of profit warnings. Current low rate of earnings beats is "the lowest I recall," writes S&P Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt. (brendan.conway@dowjones.com)

9:32 (Dow Jones) Barclays Capital sees signs of stabilization in the office-products category, saying while players in the highly competitive sector will remain challenged, ongoing initiatives launched by Office Depot (ODP) and OfficeMax (OMX) are helping support their core business. The investment bank says stable liquidity provides some downside support to their shares and it sees support from vendors as both ODP and OMX are current in their payments. Barclays upgrades them to equalweight; both stocks have tumbled nearly 2/3 the past year. OMX jumps 5% while ODP rises a more-modest 1.3%. (john.kell@dowjones.com)

9:27 (Dow Jones) Capacity utilization among industries comes in at 78.1% in December. While the operating rate is well above the recession's low of 67.3%, it's nowhere near the rates that would suggest production bottlenecks might trigger price hikes. Low capacity use is one reason why wholesale inflation is so low, as shown in today's PPI report. (kathleen.madigan@dowjones.com)

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved the proposed merger of NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE, DBOEF), while leaving room for the European Union to have final say on the deal.

SEC officials approved a raft of rule filings by the NYSE Euronext-owned exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Amex, as well as the Deutsche Boerse-owned International Securities Exchange, relating to a change in ownership that would see the markets move under a new parent.

The approvals are contingent upon the $17 billion combination closing. Investors and analysts now see slim odds of that happening after E.U. antitrust examiners last week recommended that EU commissioners block the deal, on grounds that it would create a monopoly in European futures and options trade. The EU is slated to take up
the matter Feb. 1, with a Feb. 9 deadline to turn in a verdict.

Minister  urges hard line on stock exchange merger

The Financial Services Minister has warned the  European Commission not to give in to interference from “vested interests" when it comes to rule on the $9 billion mega-exchange  merger between the  Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext.

The deal would leave the London Stock Exchange trailing in the wake of the combined giant, which would dominate world financial markets.

Joaquin Almunia, the EU’s Competition Commissioner, last week said that he would block the merger because it would create a business with more than 90 per cent of listed derivatives trading and a large share of clearing.

Brussels is due to rule on the deal on February 1, and there have been fears that considerations of competition might be overruled by pressure from the Franco-German axis.

The merged business would own not only the New York Stock Exchange and those in Paris, Germany and other smaller countries but also two derivatives platforms, the Börse’s Eurex and NYSE Euronext’s Liffe, based in London.
Yesterday Mark Hoban urged commissioners to avoid being swayed by political arguments in favour of the deal. “In a post-crisis market where we have seen extensive consolidation across the board, we cannot afford to sit
back and sacrifice competition and customer welfare," he said.

Speaking at the LSE’s headquarters at Paternoster Square, he said that the EU competition authorities had a reputation for objective and rigorous analysis and a record of promoting the EU’s single market objectives.

“It is vital that DG Competition lives up to those duties in the weeks and months to come, without political interference," the minister said.

“I fully understand nonetheless that the Commission faces a huge challenge to resist pressure to delay, obfuscate and pander to vested interests in the EU."

NYSE Euronext has said that it would fight the attempt to block the deal, calling arguments over competition “fundamentally flawed". Mr Almunia has suggested that either Eurex or Liffe should be sold if the deal were to be allowed through, so opening up the market to more competition. But this is seen as unacceptable to the two parties as it undermines one of the key reasons for the merger.

Mr Almunia on Tuesday reiterated his view that competition between exchanges and in clearing was needed to ensure efficient markets for users.

New hurdle to exchanges’ merger;  E.U. advisory panel backs decision to block NYSE’s deal with
Deutsche Börse
By JAMES KANTER
659 words
19 January 2012
International Herald Tribune

The European Union’s competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, has won support from European government representatives on an advisory panel in his effort to block a  merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse in one of the last stages before a formal decision on the deal is made early next month.

For months, the  European Commission, the Union’s executive body in Brussels, has raised concerns about the deal, which would create the world’s biggest stock exchange company, operating the New York Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and other markets.

The recommendation Tuesday by the antitrust advisory panel, which is not binding, is the latest sign that the regulatory obstacles in the way of the deal may be insurmountable. The deal would put the vast majority of the exchange-traded derivatives market in Europe, and a sizable proportion of the region’s stock trading, in the hands of one company.

A main sticking point has been the refusal by NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse to sell parts of their derivatives exchange businesses, which Mr. Almunia has concluded would give the combined company too much power over derivatives trading.

That issue was the focus at a meeting in Brussels on Jan. 9, when Mr. Almunia asked Duncan L. Niederauer, the chief executive of NYSE Euronext, to sell a derivatives exchange known as Liffe, based in London, or withdraw from the deal.

‘‘Of course not,’’ Mr. Niederauer told Mr. Almunia, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were continuing. ‘‘There’s no way we’ll withdraw,’’ Mr. Niederauer told Mr. Almunia.

Mr. Niederauer told Mr. Almunia that the analysis carried out by European investigators had been ‘‘deeply flawed’’ because it had considered the market for derivatives to be solely European, rather than global and had made it appear that the merger would reduce competition far more than would be the case in practice.

NYSE Euronext executives have repeatedly argued that they face considerable competition from the CME Group, a derivatives exchange based in Chicago, saying that it has more employees in Europe than Liffe and a larger portfolio of interest-rate derivatives than the combined NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse businesses.

The firm stance taken by Mr. Niederauer and his apparent willingness to see the deal blocked formally in Europe may be a sign that the exchanges are preparing to sue the European Commission, accusing it of wrongfully stopping the deal.

That would be a serious problem for the commission, where officials still harbor painful memories of losing a string of appeals against blocked mergers early in the past decade. The European Court of Justice ruled that those decisions had been defective.

Since the meeting between Mr. Almunia and Mr. Niederauer, the exchanges have stepped up a lobbying campaign aimed at turning members of the European Commission in their favor.
Last Friday, Mr. Niederauer and the Deutsche Börse chief executive, Reto Francioni, wrote a letter to José
Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission and Mr. Almunia’s superior, expressing ‘‘profound
Page 39 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
concern’’ that blocking the takeover ‘‘would represent a serious missed opportunity at a critical juncture for
Europe.’’

Mr. Niederauer and Mr. Francioni also sought to assure Mr. Barroso of ‘‘the European character of the new company,’’ which would generate 70 percent of its revenues in Europe and be incorporated in the Netherlands.

They also suggested that allowing the merger would further European goals of bringing changes in the financial services sector because NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse had ‘‘shown themselves to be a bridgehead of integrity and transparency against a tidal wave of opacity and greed that permeates the less-regulated segments of financial markets.’’

Mr. Niederauer met Tuesday with Viviane Reding, the European Union commissioner for justice, apparently to reinforce that message.

The committee of national cartel offices agreed with the plan of the European Commission (EC) to block the
merger between German stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse and US NYSE Euronext.
The Commission was content with the result from the consultations with the national regulators, media reported. The vote of the national authorities does not have any binding effect on the decision of the EC, but it strengthens
the position of Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

NYSE May Appeal If Deutsche Boerse Deal Blocked

The head of NYSE Euronext (NYX) said the exchange may appeal if  European regulators block its planned
merger with Deutsche Boerse AG (DBOEF, DB1.XE).

The exchanges are lobbying fiercely to preserve the planned pact after  European Union antitrust examiners last week recommended that  EU commissioners block the deal, on grounds that it would create a monopoly in European listed futures and options trade.
"If the deal is blocked we will consider all options, including an appeal," NYSE Chief Executive Duncan
Niederauer said in an interview with Cinco Dias, the Spanish newspaper.
His remarks were disclosed in a regulatory filing.

Niederauer told the paper he had "misjudged" the potential for the merger to be blocked on the grounds it created an industry concentration in Europe, with the exchanges arguing that regulators should consider the global
market for derivatives trading.

He said antitrust examiners had "made a very clear mistake" in using Europe as the market, though the exchanges had received support for its position from some EU commissioners. It is rare for the Commission to go against the recommendation of antitrust officials.

"We are trying to convince the other commissioners," said Niederauer in a transcript of the interview. "We have met some of them and there is a lot of sympathy with our position."
The EU is slated to take up the matter Feb. 1, with a Feb. 9 deadline to turn in a verdict. Niederauer told Cinco Dias the exchanges would "fight till the end" if the deal is blocked.

U.S. regulators have cleared the proposed  merger of Deutsche Börse AG and NYSE Euronext Inc., which would create the world's biggest stock exchange operator, but the deal still needs European regulatory approval.
The Securities and Exchange Commission formally approved the $10 billion acquisition by Germany's  Deutsche
Börse of NYSE Euronext on Tuesday and made the decision public Wednesday.

The SEC said it reviewed the proposal carefully and found the merger would comply with securities laws and promote fair trading.

Minister  urges hard line on stock exchange merger

The Financial Services Minister has warned the  European Commission not to give in to interference from "vested interests" when it comes to rule on the $9 billion mega-exchange  merger between the  Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext.

The deal would leave the London Stock Exchange trailing in the wake of the combined giant, which would dominate world financial markets.

Joaquin Almunia, the EU's Competition Commissioner, last week said that he would block the merger because it would create a business with more than 90 per cent of listed derivatives trading and a large share of clearing.

Brussels is due to rule on the deal on February 1, and there have been fears that considerations of competition might be overruled by pressure from the Franco-German axis.

The merged business would own not only the New York Stock Exchange and those in Paris, Germany and other smaller countries but also two derivatives platforms, the Börse's Eurex and NYSE Euronext's Liffe, based in London.
Yesterday Mark Hoban urged commissioners to avoid being swayed by political arguments in favour of the deal. "In a post-crisis market where we have seen extensive consolidation across the board, we cannot afford to sit
back and sacrifice competition and customer welfare," he said.

Speaking at the LSE's headquarters at Paternoster Square, he said that the EU competition authorities had a reputation for objective and rigorous analysis and a record of promoting the EU's single market objectives.

"It is vital that DG Competition lives up to those duties in the weeks and months to come, without political interference," the minister said.

"I fully understand nonetheless that the Commission faces a huge challenge to resist pressure to delay, obfuscate and pander to vested interests in the EU."

NYSE Euronext has said that it would fight the attempt to block the deal, calling arguments over competition "fundamentally flawed". Mr Almunia has suggested that either Eurex or Liffe should be sold if the deal were to be allowed through, so opening up the market to more competition. But this is seen as unacceptable to the two parties as it undermines one of the key reasons for the merger.

Mr Almunia on Tuesday reiterated his view that competition between exchanges and in clearing was needed to ensure efficient markets for users.

SEC Approves NYSE Deal; But a Looming Block by Europe Could Still Scuttle  Merger

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved the proposed  merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse AG, adding to U.S. authorizations of a deal seen likely to be nixed by European Union regulators.

SEC officials approved a raft of rule filings by the NYSE Euronext-owned exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange and  NYSE Amex, as well as the Deutsche Börse-owned International Securities Exchange, relating to a change in ownership that would see the markets move under a new parent.

The approvals are contingent upon the planned $17 billion combination closing. Investors and analysts now see slim odds of that happening after EU antitrust examiners last week recommended that the body's commissioners block the deal on grounds that it would establish a monopoly in European listed futures and options trade. The EU is slated to take up the matter Feb. 1, with a Feb. 9 deadline to turn in a verdict.
A spokesman for NYSE Euronext said that the company welcomed the SEC decisions.

In mid-October, exchange rule filings related to changes of ownership were filed by the New York Stock Exchange and its sister markets Amex and Arca, all owned by NYSE Euronext. Options-exchange operator ISE submitted a similar rule change, as did the two stock markets run by Direct Edge Holdings LLC. New York-based ISE is wholly owned by Deutsche Börse's derivatives unit Eurex; ISE in turn owns a 31.5% stake in Direct Edge.

All of those exchanges needed the SEC's approval to become subsidiaries of a new parent that would be formed by the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext merger. Wednesday was the deadline for SEC officials to rule on the matter.

A greenlight from the SEC follows approvals from other major U.S. regulatory agencies. In August, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States allowed the deal to proceed, and in late December, the U.S. Department of Justice approved it on the condition that the ISE divest itself of its ownership in Direct Edge, which competes directly with the NYSE's stock-trading platforms.

Those blessings will be moot, however, if EU commissioners deem the deal anticompetitive. Such hurdles to the deal have been seen as higher in Europe, where together the companies account for an estimated 93% of business in exchange-traded derivatives. Trading U.S. futures is a small business for NYSE Euronext, and Deutsche Börse has no U.S.-based platform.

Executives of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are now mounting a lobbying effort to convince EU policy makers that the deal will improve regulators' view into trading activity and strengthen the region's voice in global market matters.

NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer met with two commissioners Tuesday, and efforts are seen ramping up at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month.

The European Commission (EC) will most likely not allow the  merger between Deutsche Boerse and Nyse
Euronext, the commissioner Joaquin Almunia warned.
The EC has preliminary objections against the combination of two large stock exchange operators in  Europe. Almunia said that stock exchanges are an important instrument in modern capital markets and competition
between them has to exist.

Thus, the commissioner gave a signal of what the the result of the authority's examinations into the deal will be some two weeks ahead of the deadline.

D.Boerse open to guaranteeing German ops in NYSE deal

FRANKFURT, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse has offered discussing a legally binding agreement to protect its Frankfurt operations in order to gain German support for a planned  merger with NYSE Euronext .

"The main aspects are the commitment to make investments of 300 million euros over a course of three years, no forced layoffs for a minimum of two years and the offer to enlarge the location (Frankfurt) to be the operations hub for the whole of  Europe," a spokesman for Boerse said on Sunday.
He said these guarantees would come in addition to an agreement to locate the Derivatives, Market Data and
Custody & Settlement business units in Frankfurt and Eschborn.

Boerse and NYSE launched a lobbying effort in Europe to save their $9 billion merger, as European antitrust regulators made it clear they would recommend the deal be blocked, Reuters reported earlier this month.

US antitrust agencies stay on high alert; Competition watchdogs keen to build on successes of 2011

The European Commission’s review of the proposed  merger between rival exchange operators  Deutsche         Börse and NYSE Euronext may be hogging the antitrust limelight but US counterparts remain very much on the prowl as they look to maintain momentum after a largely successful 2011.
Responsibility for antitrust enforcement in the US is divided between the Federal Trade Commission and the
Department of Justice.

Their recent track record has won praise from law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, which said in a note to clients this month that both had acted firmly on president Obama’s call for “vigorous antitrust enforcement” last year.

According to the note, the FTC acted in 10 cases last year, nine of which related to healthcare. The Department of Justice challenged 14 transactions last year, up from eight in 2010, and it also caused two others to be abandoned according to the note.

Bert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, an independent research and advocacy group, said: “One can feel a sense of momentum after the agencies won a couple of important cases last year but it remains to be seen if that will continue.”

One scalp won by the Department of Justice without recourse to trial was forcing telecoms firm AT&T to abandon its high-profile $39bn proposed acquisition of rival T-Mobile USA – the largest deal announced last year.

Peter Guryan, partner in the antitrust group at Fried Frank, also pointed to a court win for the agency last year when it blocked online tax preparation company H&R Block’s proposed acquisition of rival TaxAct as having been particularly significant.

Guryan said: “The H&R Block case was the Department of Justice’s first merger trial since 2004 and its first victory since 2003, and so was very important in highlighting the agency as a credible litigation threat.”

He expects more of the same from the US agencies in terms of aggressive enforcement this year, increasing the regulatory risk for deals, particularly in technology and healthcare. These sectors are traditional areas of focus for the agencies and are also expected to generate more transactions. Guryan also anticipates both agencies will continue to apply behavioural remedies to deals, setting limitations on how a merged firm acts after completion, rather than structural remedies, such as forcing the sale of assets.

Foer, however, is concerned agencies may be putting too much faith in behavioural solutions. He said: “In three very large cases the agencies consented to deals which maybe should have not been allowed. There are limitations to behavioural remedies and a structural approach may be better.”

In a paper last year, the American Antitrust Institute said: “Behavioural remedies require ongoing oversight, monitoring, and compliance enforcement on the part of the government and a parallel compliance organisation within the merged company. Both may involve non-trivial costs.”

Whether this trend continues will become evident from the outcome of closely watched deals from last year that are still going through the antitrust process: the $34bn merger between Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions, which would create the largest US pharmacy benefits manager; and Google’s $12.9bn acquisition of telecoms firm Motorola Mobility.

There is no way back after NYSE-Börse talks; Public and industry opinion may be turning against the
German model but this saga will have an impact on all
Michelle Price

As the European Commission inches ever closer to what many believe will be the rejection of the  merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, it is becoming clear that the entire  merger saga has had an irrevocable impact on the exchanges themselves, and the industry at large.

The process isn’t over until the fat lady – played here by the  European Commission’s top brass – sings, but let’s imagine that the exchanges withdraw the deal at the 11th hour. Who would be left with the worst bruises?

The industry’s best analysts are divided on the answer to this question. Some have argued that NYSE Euronext may be worth more as an independent company, since it would be less exposed to Europe – the sovereign debt basket case.

On the other hand, the bourse is more exposed to the cash equities business at a time when trading volumes are low and margins are thinning. Deutsche Börse, meanwhile, is exposed to Europe’s ongoing fiscal saga.

At the same time, however, it is less leveraged than NYSE Euronext and is very nicely diversified with a formidable post-trade franchise.

Both bourses will have to work hard to globalise their franchises and would suffer should a Brussels-born financial transaction tax come to pass.

So, let’s call that a draw. It is arguable, however, that Deutsche Börse has been damaged by the affair in one way that NYSE Euronext has not: the legitimacy of a key part of the German exchange’s business model has been publicly called into doubt.
Turning the tide

Unlike NYSE Euronext, the German exchange operates what is known as a closed vertical silo. Once a trade is executed on its cash or derivatives platform, it is funnelled into its clearing house, Eurex Clearing. It cannot be sent to clear elsewhere and, moreover, other trading platforms cannot access its clearing pool.

The commercial logic of owning your own clearer, and forcing customers to use it, is simple: the exchange takes an additional fee and picks up juicy collateral assets – which are pledged as security against positions – that can be lent on at a nice rate.

The deal with NYSE Euronext, which does not own a major derivatives clearing house, ramped up this industrial logic to a mouth-watering scale by proposing to push derivatives traded on NYSE’s platform Liffe – which were historically cleared through Anglo-French clearer LCH.Clearnet – through Eurex too.
As such, the merger was almost entirely predicated on dramatically enhancing a commercial model that Deutsche
Börse had successfully operated for decades – thrusting that very model into an unflattering spotlight.

Almost overnight, the clearing silo was brought to the attention of just about every regulator in the European Union. For competitors of the German exchange, the deal gave them an opportunity to opine to those very regulators on just how anti-competitive the silo can be.

Even if the exchanges pull the deal – and the Commission does not publish its final analysis – this process has left its mark. For one thing, the Commission’s objections to the deal specifically highlighted clearing as an area of competitive concern.
Page 58 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The subsequent remedies proposed by the exchanges, inasmuch as they offered to partially open up Eurex Clearing to third parties, offered tacit acknowledgement by the exchanges that the clearing silo is a competitive problem.
In this respect, the remedy proposal did for Deutsche Börse what open talk of Greece leaving the eurozone did
for the European sovereign debt crisis: it transported the debate beyond a once unassailable boundary by stating
for everyone to hear that the unthinkable was not only thinkable, it was possible too.
Coup de grâce

This intellectual shift is also evident in broader regulatory developments that may ultimately prove the coup de grâce for Deutsche Börse’s closed silo.

The exchanges announced their tie-up at a crucial time for the European rule-making process just as key reforms, such as the European market infrastructure regulation and the markets in financial instruments directive, are
being penned.

Both pieces contain provisions that attempt to break open clearing houses to increased competition. In the case of Emir, these were already in the text as the exchanges announced their deal.

It is no secret, however, that Emir became a battleground shortly after as the German exchange pressurised key negotiators to water down the text and as those negotiators, growing increasingly conscious of the implications, attempted – less successfully – to hold out.

This, say Brussels insiders, made Mifid, which was some months behind Emir, a super-high stakes piece of reform.

Although the consultation text contained a detail-light reference to clearing reform, the final legislative proposal published in October last year surprised many in the market by including stringent stipulations regarding
non-discriminatory access to clearing.
In other words, the Commission had Deutsche Börse – and its potential deal – in its sights.

True, the wording of legislative proposals are writ in water, but it is now evident that the broader tide of public, industry and regulatory opinion is turning against the Deutsche Börse model.

EU's Barnier:  Need Time To Review Deutsche Boerse/NYSE Merger
By Jacob Bunge and Matthew Dalton

A key member of the  European Commission signaled Tuesday that he wanted more time to review the proposed merger of NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE, DBOEF), casting new uncertainty around a deal that many investors and analysts already have given up for dead.
Michel Barnier, the  European Union's commissioner for internal market and services, on Tuesday placed a
so-called "waiting reserve" on the matter, giving him leeway to potentially challenge a recommendation from  EU
antitrust regulators that the $17 billion combination be blocked.

"The decision that must be taken by the college is important, and the commissioner Michel Barnier who has been on a long, official trip to China, Japan and then London, hopes to take the personal time necessary before pronouncing on the issue," said a spokeswoman for Barnier in a statement Tuesday.

Competition authorities for the EU earlier this month determined that the merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which run Europe's two biggest derivatives exchanges, would represent a monopoly.

A key member of the European Commission signaled Tuesday that he wanted more time to review the proposed merger of NYSE Euronext (NYX) and Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE, DBOEF), casting new uncertainty around a deal that many investors and analysts already have given up for dead.
Michel Barnier, the European Union's commissioner for internal market and services, on Tuesday placed a
so-called "waiting reserve" on the matter, giving him leeway to potentially challenge a recommendation from EU
antitrust regulators that the $17 billion combination be blocked.

"The decision that must be taken by the college is important, and the commissioner Michel Barnier who has been on a long, official trip to China, Japan and then London, hopes to take the personal time necessary before pronouncing on the issue," said a spokeswoman for Barnier in a statement Tuesday.

Competition authorities for the EU earlier this month determined that the merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which run Europe's two biggest derivatives exchanges among many other markets, would represent a monopoly. The two companies together account for an estimated 93% of trading in listed futures and options.

While commissioners for the EU are widely expected to follow the antitrust division's recommendation, executives for NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse have sought to press their case with commissioners directly in hopes of convincing them that competition authorities' analysis was flawed, and that their deal be allowed to proceed.
The European Commission is slated to formally discuss the matter at a meeting on Feb. 1.

Officials in Barnier's internal markets and financial services directorate have for years sought to boost competition against incumbent exchanges and clearing houses, so officials in that part of the commission bureaucracy may
be unsympathetic to the arguments being made by Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext.

Barnier has separately backed an expansion of the EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MIFID, which is seen upping competition among derivatives markets and tightening oversight of private share-trading platforms and financial advisors.

The commissioner already is familiar with both Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext because his department deals with the exchanges.

The exchanges have pitched their deal, which would create the world's largest platform for share listings and a dominant player in European stocks and derivatives trade, as the chance for Europe to create a regional champion that could represent the EU in globalizing financial markets.

Reto Francioni, chief executive and chairman of Deutsche Boerse, called the merger a "great chance for Europe" in remarks Tuesday at an event hosted by the company. Manfred Gentz, the company's supervisory board chairman, warned that Europe could not hope to compete on the world stage with its current "scattered exchange landscape."

"Today, markets must be viewed globally, not on a national, local or regional level," Gentz said, adding that the EU appears to ignore the global dimension. Exchange executives have also argued that the EU antitrust review overlooked competition from over-the-counter derivatives markets, which are larger than those supervised by exchanges.

NYSE Euronext shares closed 0.7% lower Tuesday at $27.24, while Deutsche Boerse shares were 0.9% higher at EUR42.85 in electronic trading.

The European Commission next week will block the  merger of Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX), agreeing with  EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia's recommendation, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

Almunia presented a 459-page document laying out his case to the other 26 commissioners last Friday, the person told Reuters.

Boerse Chmn: Europe's  Scattered Exchanges  Can't Compete Globally

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Europe cannot compete in global financial markets due to its "scattered exchange landscape," Manfred Gentz, supervisory board chairman of Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE), said Tuesday, in a strong move to advocate the  merger plans with U.S. peer NYSE Euronext (NYX).

"It is neither megalomania nor the aim to dominate while disregarding competition, if we fight for the merger of this company [Deutsche Boerse] and NYSE Euronext," Gentz told an audience at Deutsche Boerse's new year's reception. "Today, markets must be viewed globally, not on a national, local or regional level," Gentz said.

He added that the planned merger will create a strong European exchange that together with a strong U.S. partner will be able to compete in other regions of the world.

Both exchange operators are currently awaiting the verdict of the European Union on the merger plans. The EU, the main hurdle for the $17 billion deal, announced last February, will make a decision in early February. If antitrust concerns dominate the decision, it will likely block the merger.

Among others, EU Competition Chief Joaquin Almunia has criticized the would-be merged company's market dominance in the Europe-listed derivatives business, in which it would have a combined market share of about
93%.

Deutsche Boerse CEO: Tie-Up With NYSE Great Chance For Europe

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Deutsche Boerse AG's (DB1.XE) planned  merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX) is a
"great chance for  Europe," Reto Francioni, chief executive of the German exchange operator, said Tuesday.

The merger aims to create a company that is able to set global standards and contribute to boost Europe's influence in the future set-up of global financial systems, Francioni said.

While public attention last year focused on the financial crisis and the companies' merger plans, a number of exchanges, notably in Asia, Brazil and Russia, fostered cooperations and showed strong growth. Deutsche Boerse managed to remain among the top-three listed exchanges by market capitalization.

"All other European exchanges, which had been strong in the past, don't play a major role any more," Francioni said, adding that this development will continue, possibly at a faster pace.

As both companies await the decision of the European Union's Competition Commission, Francioni added that the merger plans received a lot of approval from shareholders, regulators, companies and politicians.

The EU, the main hurdle for the $17 billion combination disclosed in February 2011, is expected to disclose its decision in early February. If antitrust grounds dominate the decision, it will likely block the merger.

According to a media report by Reuters Tuesday that cited a person familiar with the matter, the Commission will block the merger, agreeing with EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia's recommendation.

Is NYSE-Börse deal dead? WAITING FOR THE FAT LADY

After getting clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division for their  merger in late December, NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Börse AG were hoping for similar clearance from competition authorities in Europe. But that hope now appears to be fading.

Official word from the  European Commission is due by Feb. 9, but industry sources say that the  European Union’s competition office will recommend against the combination and that the $17 billion deal is all but dead. Some negotiations on possible divestitures of operations are expected to continue as the commission nears its decision, but observers say there is little hope.

“It’s time to get the obituaries rolling,” says exchange consultant Patrick L. Young. “This thing is toast — either that or the parties will have to sever a profit artery to do a deal the market doesn’t want anymore.” He adds that the EU probably did the parties a favor in light of continuing uncertainty about the future of the euro.

As part of its clearance the DOJ has entered a consent decree with NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse requiring the sale of the International Securities Exchange’s minority stake in Direct Edge Holdings LLC. ISE is wholly owned by Eurex, the derivatives exchange of Deutsche Börse. The parties would have at least two years from the closing of their combination to sell the 31.54% stake.

Glimmer of Hope Emerges for NYSE-Deutsche Börse Deal

A key member of the European Commission signaled Tuesday that he wanted more time to review the proposed merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse AG, casting new uncertainty around a deal that many investors and analysts already have given up for dead.
Michel Barnier, the  European Union's commissioner for internal market and services, on Tuesday placed a
so-called waiting reserve on the matter, giving him leeway to potentially challenge a recommendation from  EU
antitrust regulators that the $17 billion combination be blocked.

"The decision that must be taken by the college is important, and the commissioner Michel Barnier who has been on a long, official trip to China, Japan and then London, hopes to take the personal time necessary before pronouncing on the issue," a spokeswoman for Mr. Barnier said.

Competition authorities for the EU earlier this month determined that the merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, which run Europe's two biggest derivatives exchanges among many other markets, would represent a monopoly. The two companies together account for an estimated 93% of trading in listed futures and options.

While commissioners for the EU are widely expected to follow the antitrust division's recommendation, executives for NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have sought to press their case with commissioners directly in hopes of convincing them that competition authorities' analysis was flawed, and that their deal be allowed to proceed.
The European Commission is slated to formally discuss the matter at a meeting on Feb. 1.

Officials in Mr. Barnier's internal markets and financial services directorate have for years sought to boost competition against incumbent exchanges and clearinghouses, so officials in that part of the commission bureaucracy may be unsympathetic to the arguments being made by Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext.

Mr. Barnier has separately backed an expansion of the EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MIFID, which is seen increasing competition among derivatives markets and tightening oversight of private share-trading platforms and financial advisors.

The commissioner already is familiar with both Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext because his department deals with the exchanges.

EU's Barnier:  Need Time To Review Deutsche Boerse/NYSE Merger

A key member of the  European Commission signaled Tuesday that he wanted more time to review the proposed merger of NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE, DBOEF), casting new uncertainty around a deal that many investors and analysts already have given up for dead.
Michel Barnier, the  European Union's commissioner for internal market and services, on Tuesday placed a
so-called "waiting reserve" on the matter, giving him leeway to potentially challenge a recommendation from  EU
antitrust regulators that the $17 billion combination be blocked.

"The decision that must be taken by the college is important, and the commissioner Michel Barnier who has been on a long, official trip to China, Japan and then London, hopes to take the personal time necessary before pronouncing on the issue," said a spokeswoman for Barnier in a statement Tuesday.

Competition authorities for the EU earlier this month determined that the merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which run Europe's two biggest derivatives exchanges, would represent a monopoly. The two companies together account for an estimated 93% of trading in listed futures and options.

While commissioners for the EU are widely expected to follow the antitrust division's recommendation, executives for NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse have sought to press their case with commissioners directly in hopes of convincing them that competition authorities' analysis was flawed, and that their deal be allowed to proceed.
The European Commission is slated to discuss the matter at a meeting on Feb. 1.

EU Almunia: Deutsche Bourse/NYSE Decision  To Be Adopted  Feb 1 Without  Doubt

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, will rule on the planned merger of exchange operators Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) on Feb. 1,
as planned, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Wednesday.

A so-called "waiting reserve" that Michel Barnier, the  EU's commissioner for internal market and services, Tuesday placed on the matter hasn't pushed that announcement back, Almunia said.

"I can confirm that a decision will be adopted Feb. 1 indeed, without any doubt," Almunia said at the commission's press conference.

A spokeswoman said in a statement Tuesday that Barnier, who has been on a long official travel, wanted more time to review the proposed merger, raising new hopes of garnering support for the proposed $17 billion combination that many investors and analysts have given up upon.

The commission will likely block the deal on antitrust grounds, though executives from both exchanges have been fiercely lobbying for their case and also hope to win political support at the Davos World Economic Forum.

Among others, Almunia has criticized the would-be merged company's market dominance in the Europe-listed derivatives business, in which it would have a combined market share of about 93%. He is also excluding the over-the-counter, non-listed European derivatives market when looking at the competition situation.

FINANCIAL MARKETS : NYSE-DEUTSCHE BÖRSE MERGER: COMMISSION VETO LIKELY

Efforts by  NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Börse to rally the support of  European Commission President José Manuel Barroso to their cause seem to have come to nothing. According to informed sources, the  EU executive is preparing to veto the  merger of the German stock exchange and  NYSE Euronext, which groups the New York, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon exchanges. The merged entity would be the world's largest stock market operator in all market activities (cash, derivatives, delivery versus payment, custodial services and market data).

The Commission, which is set to issue its verdict in early February, is mainly concerned about overlaps in the stock options sector in  Europe and in stock-index futures and interest rates.

The parties to the merger have tried to convince Barroso that derivatives negotiated on over the counter markets would continue to represent serious competition to their merged platform. They also claim that a veto would not only be harmful to European exchanges but would also have a negative spill-over effect in other parts of the world. To encourage Germany to support them, the parties have also promised to make investments of €300 million in this country, to freeze layoffs for at least two years and to develop the Frankfurt financial centre into an operations centre for the entire EU.

National competition authorities in the EU expressed a negative opinion on the proposed merger in mid-January and the majority of commissioners will in all likelihood do the same. NYSE and Deutsche Börse do not rule out bringing a legal action before the EU Court of Justice.

If the  NYSE Euronext (NYX), Deutsche Boerse (DBOEY)  merger were to fail, it could mark the end of an era in which the biggest exchange companies could expand through mergers, reports Bloomberg Businessweek. In Europe, antitrust regulators are recommending against the deal.

BRUSSELS, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said Wednesday it would rule on the  merger of exchange operators Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext on Feb. 1 as planned, denying rumours that the decision might be put back.

"I can confirm to you that the decision will be adopted on Feb. 1 indeed, without any doubt,"  European Union (EU) Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told a press conference.

Doubts about the timetable for ruling on the proposed merger came when a spokesman for Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for internal market and services, said Tuesday that Barnier "hopes to take the personal time necessary before pronouncing on the issue."

When asked whether the prohibition of the deal could possibly hamper consolidation in the exchanges sector, Almunia said he would address the matter when the decision is announced next week.

Almunia criticized the planned merger valued at 17 billion U.S. dollars, saying it would give the new exchange operator a combined market share of 93 percent in the Europe-listed derivatives business.

BRUSSELS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The  European Commission will decide on the  merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext on Feb. 1 and there will be no change in the timetable, the  EU's antitrust chief said on Wednesday.

"I can confirm to you that the decision will be adopted Feb. 1 indeed, without any doubt,"  EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told a news briefing when asked if it was possible that the decision could be put back.

Almunia declined to comment on the possibility that prohibition of the deal might hamper consolidation in the sector, saying only that he would address the matter when the decision is announced next week.

A person familiar with the matter has told Reuters that Almunia's 26 fellow commissioners will follow his advice to block the deal. He presented a 459-page document laying out his case to the other 26 last Friday, the person said.

Most EU commissioners against Deutsche Boerse, Nyse merger - report

(SeeNews) - Jan 25, 2012 - The  merger between Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) and  Nyse Euronext (NYSE:NYX) is likely to fall through as the majority of the EU commissioners plan to block the deal, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing an insider.
As many as 25 of 27  EU commissioners have signalled that they will support  EU Competition Commissioner
Joaquin Almunia and will vote against the USD 9 billion (EUR 6.92bn) deal on February 1, Reuters said.

Another commissioner said that he first wants to review the 459-page document on the deal and then make a decision. However, he will probably vote against the deal too, Reuters said.

A spokesman for Deutsche Boerse told Reuters, that the German company has not been informed about a decision. Chief supervisor Manfred Gentz also hopes for a positive decision.

The European Commission (EC) opposes the deal as it fears that the company that will emerge from the deal as the world's largest stock market operator will hurt competition because of its domination position in derivative markets in Europe. Deutsche Boerse's Eurex and Nyse's Liffe control more than 90% of derivative stock market trading.

(SeeNews) - Jan 25, 2012 - The  European Commission (EC) will decide whether to approve the planned  merger between Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) and  NYSE Euronext (NYSE:NYX) on February 1, 2012,  EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia confirmed today.
According to a report of news agency Reuters, the planned  merger is likely to fall through as the majority of the

As many as 25 of 27 EU commissioners have signalled that they will support Almunia and will vote against the

The EC has concerns that the company that will emerge from the deal as the world's largest stock market operator will hurt competition because of its domination position in derivative markets in Europe.

According to the initial plans of the stock exchange operators, the merger was supposed to be completed by the end of 2011. The deal has already got approval in the United States, but it also needs EC's clearance.

EUROPEAN commissioner Michel Barnier offered some hope that  Deutsche Boerse's merger with NYSE
Euronext will be given the go-ahead by competition regulators.

Barnier placed a "waiting reserve" on the issue at a Commission meeting yesterday, meaning he could alter any recommendation by the  EU antitrust authorities on the $17bn tiein.
However, sources familiar with the matter said Barnier would not object if the EU does block the deal. The college of commissioners will vote on the merger on 1 February.

Ad urges  EU commissioners, set to formally decide on the deal next Wednesday, to "do what's best for  Europe" and take a global view of financial markets, where a combined NYSE-Deutsche Boerse would represent only 16% of all trade in derivatives contracts linked to key interest rates -- a key sticking point for  EU authorities.

4:52 (Dow Jones) While the Fed gave bulls a chance to bolt today, it probably won't be long before their stamina gets tested. Troubles in Europe temporarily fell off the radar this afternoon, but haven't disappeared, especially as time runs thin for Greece to hammer out a deal with bondholders. US financial stocks gained today, but notably lagged most sectors, perhaps suggesting some lingering Europe-related anxiety. Tomorrow also brings earnings reports from DJIA components AT&T (T), 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT), all before the opening bell. Both CAT and MMM have had pretty strong runs heading into their reports, with MMM up almost 6% this month, and CAT soaring 20%. (john.shipman@dowjones.com)

4:40 (Dow Jones) Cross selling storage and security software and services to customers is delivering a revenue and earnings boost to Symantec (SYMC) said CFO James Beer in an interview. Of the 135 deals worth $1 million or more the company signed during its fiscal third quarter, 41% included both storage and security, compared to
38% a year ago. SYMC is "continuing to increase that cross selling percentage," which is one reason the company delivered 32 cents a share in earnings, a full nickel ahead of expectations. SYMC was up 0.5% to
$17.15 in after-hours trading. (steve-d.jones@dowjones.com)

4:39 (Dow Jones) The spectrum AT&T (T) is transferring to T-Mobile USA is worth more than the $1B AT&T has estimated, JPMorgan says. Based on the price of recent deals for wireless airwaves, the spectrum is actually worth around $1.45B, the bank says. T isn't giving up spectrum in areas where it will jeopardize its planned 4G LTE network buildout, such as Miami and Chicago where it needs additional airwaves, JPM says. T and T-Mobile applied with the FCC on Jan 20 for approval of the spectrum license transfer and could face some additional scrutiny or conditions if the deal is to go through. (greg.bensinger@dowjones.com)

4:35 (Dow Jones) Lower-for-longer is giving bond buyers the courage to pick up Treasurys dating out five to seven years in maturity with less worry about interest-rate risk. This is ironing out the Treasury yield curve as middle-dated yields drop. The same cannot be said at the far-end of the curve, though. The Fed's easy policy is also revving up concerns about future inflation. There may be "some weakening at the back end of the curve due to increased concern about a policy error that fans the flames of inflation expectations," said Credit Suisse's Scott Sherman. Indeed, 30-year bonds lagged other maturities today, and the gap between 10- and 30-year yields blew out six basis points to 1.15%. (cynthia.lin@dowjones.com)

4:35 (Dow Jones) Netflix (NFLX) said its DVD rental members declined sharply over the last two quarters -- some, no doubt, because of the company's own PR blunders. The weekly cancellation rate of DVD subscribers has subsided, NFLX said, though the company expects attrition to continue. In 1Q, the company expects to lose
1.5M DVD subscribers. Losing those DVD customers will actually be a mixed blessing, as analysts say streaming videos over the Internet costs significantly less than shipping a DVD to customers. NFLX routinely says its future is in streaming. (ian.sherr@dowjones.com)

4:34 (Dow Jones) Issuance of CMBS conduits may reach $45B in 2012, said David Nass, head of capital markets for US real estate finance at UBS Securities. Speaking at the American Securitization Forum's annual conference, Nass said he's more optimistic than many forecasters calling for $35B -- slightly above 2011 levels -- as the
Page 89 of 126 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CMBS market was "fully functioning" with plenty of liquidity for debt across the ratings spectrum. Nass' prediction comes as CMBS yield risk premiums have declined since November, easing concern that volatile and higher rates would crunch profits and discourage new lending. (albert.yoon@dowjones.com)

4:33 (Dow Jones) Netflix (NFLX) publicly acknowledges what has been speculated -- including a story in today's New York Post -- that Amazon (AMZN) is preparing to carve out its video-streaming service as a standalone, subscription-based operation. Such a move would make the Amazon service a more direct competitor to NFLX. In its letter to shareholders, NFLX said it expects AMZN to keep the service as part of Prime but also offer it separately "at a price less than ours." NFLX isn't worried, though. "Both Amazon and Hulu Plus's content is a fraction of our content, and we believe their respective total viewing hours are each less than 10% of ours." NFLX shares jump on better-than-expected results, up 9.8% to $104.31. (george.stahl@dowjones.com)

4:29 (Dow Jones) The 30-yr bond is the worst performer in the Treasury market with an earlier rally basically petering out into the close. Some traders tie the underperformance to the Fed's extension of ultra-low policy rates, which spurs demand for hedges against longer-term inflation risks. Concerns about the Fed's mismanagement on inflation -- even though price pressure is historically tame at the moment -- have been persistent from the Fed's QE1, QE2 to the latest Operation Twist. Now with Fed strengthening its commitment to low rates for longer, gold
is up more than 2%, TIPS post strong rally, while 30-yr Tsy -- typically the punch bag for inflation fears -- falters. The 30-yr bond is recently 1/32 higher to yield 3.155%, surging from a session low of 3.032%. (min.zeng@dowjones.com)

4:28 (Dow Jones) Netflix (NFLX) said it expects to end 1Q with a net of 1.7M additional US customers to end the quarter with between 22.8M and 22.3M paid subscribers. That signals a return to growth that seemed to have halted following the unpopular decision to raise the cost of its cheapest DVD and movie streaming plans, and then to split the two services into two separate websites. Customer outrage was so dramatic that NFLX backed down and agreed to keep the streaming and DVD websites the same. NFLX also said that though it was holding to the price increase, it would not institute any more. Shares up 10% after hours at $104.94. (ian.sherr@dowjones.com)

4:19 (Dow Jones) Bureau of Labor Statistics said December's grocery prices were up 6% from year ago due to commodity inflation, which indicates 4Q earnings from grocery stores should show same-store sales boosts from the higher prices. But the stat caused USDA to lower its projection of food-at-home inflation for 2012, now expecting 2.5%-3.5%, down 50bps from previous projection and signaling significant moderation from 2011's
4.25%-4.75%. The news bodes well for grocery store margins, as they've been struggling to raise prices enough to offset higher costs, but it will make sales comparisons more difficult as the year goes on. (annie.gasparro@dowjones.com)
4:19 (Dow Jones) Netflix (NFLX) said it reversed losses of subscribers, ending 4Q with 24.4M subscribers, up
610,000 from 3Q. That result helps push NFLX shares up 9% after hours to $104.00. But NFLX isn't out of the
woods yet -- it's still below the 24.59M subscribers it had at the end of 2Q, and its growth rate is far slower than it
had been in the past. The same time last year, for example, NFLX added 2.7M subscribers. Still, it's a positive
sign, and one that weary investors who've endured some steep declines must appreciate.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, will rule on the planned merger of exchange operators  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) on Feb.
1, as planned, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Wednesday.

A so-called "waiting reserve" that Michel Barnier, the  EU's commissioner for internal market and services, Tuesday placed on the matter hasn't pushed that announcement back, Almunia said.

"I can confirm that a decision will be adopted Feb. 1 indeed, without any doubt," Almunia said at the commission's press conference.

A spokeswoman said in a statement Tuesday that Barnier, who has been on a long official travel, wanted more time to review the proposed merger, raising new hopes of garnering support for the proposed $17 billion combination that many investors and analysts have given up upon.

The commission will likely block the deal on antitrust grounds, though executives from both exchanges have been fiercely lobbying for their case and also hope to win political support at the Davos World Economic Forum.

Among others, Almunia has criticized the would-be merged company's market dominance in the Europe-listed derivatives business, in which it would have a combined market share of about 93%. He is also excluding the over-the-counter, non-listed European derivatives market when looking at the competition situation.

Little hope for NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Boerse tie-up: report

The proposed merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which would create the world's largest market operator worth over $17 billion (13 billion euros) is in trouble, a senior executive was reported as saying on Thursday.

NYSE Euronext chief executive Duncan Niederauer told the Financial Times there was only a "glimmer of hope" the deal would be approved by  European competition authorities.
The newspaper's website quoted Niederauer as acknowledging he had "misjudged" the approach taken by
European Union antitrust authorities to the deal.

With the EU authorities setting out conditions that executives negotiating a deal could not accept, a tie-up looked almost certain to fall apart.
A decision by the EU's executive commission is due on February 1.

EU competition authorities opened a probe into the deal in August over concerns that the merged company would control 90 percent of the European derivatives market.

In November the companies proposed to separate some of their derivatives operations to allay EU concerns, but sources said the EU Commission was unsatisfied.
The proposed merger has also sparked controversy in the United States because it would hand over the New
York Stock Exchange to foreign owners.

A deal would see Deutsche Boerse shareholders own 60 percent of the new combined, Netherlands-incorporated firm.

Manfred Gentz, supervisory board chairman at German stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse, has severely criticised the  EU competition commissioners for opposing its planned merger with Nyse Euronext, a week before the release of  EU's official decision.

According to Gentz, it is hard to understand that the  European Commission seems to deny the global dimension of the already existing and growing competition in the stock exchange sector.

There is only a "glimmer of hope" for the proposed  merger of NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) to succeed, Duncan Niederauer,  NYSE chief executive said in an interview with the Financial Times on Thursday.
Niederauer said he "misjudged" European regulator's approach to the attempted deal. European competition staff blocked the deal earlier this month.
"There is a lot of nationalism, a lot of protectionism. Globalization is being put on hold," he said. "There will be no more mega M&A in this space."

The NYSE chief said his firm would continue to pursue smaller-scale acquisitions, especially in areas of technology and post-trade services.

AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--Exchange operator  NYSE Euronext (NYX) believes there is only a small chance that the planned merger with Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) will materialize, its chief executive said in an interview with Dutch daily Het Financieele Dagblad published Thursday.

"You have to be realistic. That chance is very small. Not zero, but small. Only a few mergers or acquisitions in Europe got the green light from the  European Commission after negative advice from the Competition Commissioner," Duncan Niederauer told the newspaper.

Media reports earlier this week said the Commission is set to block the merger, following a negative recommendation from antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia.

The E.U.'s competition authorities earlier this month determined that the merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE, which run Europe's two biggest derivatives exchanges among other markets, would represent a monopoly.
The E.U. decision is expected in early February.

0723 GMT [Dow Jones] Warburg cuts its target price for Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE) to EUR55 from EUR61 but maintains a buy rating on the stock. "We account for the possible introduction of a financial transaction tax with a price discount of EUR6 per share," the brokerage says. Warburg sees a very small chance of a successful approval of the  merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext (NYX) by the  EU antitrust commission, saying there are no indications that the commission will approve the  merger. The brokerage doesn't expect that further concessions will be made on the part of the companies. "In our opinion, investors should refocus on Deutsche Boerse's operating earnings development, which we believe to be promising," Warburg adds. Shares closed Wednesday at EUR43.64.(neetha.mahadevan@dowjones.com)

0839 GMT [Dow Jones] Euro Stoxx 50 up 0.4% at 2431.94, pushing up Thursday, aided by dovish comments by the Fed Wednesday, as the central bank pledges to maintain low interest rates until at least late 2014. Resource sectors gain amid firmer commodity prices due to the better sentiment surrounding the world's largest economy. Stoxx 600 basic resource index is up 2%. Elsewhere, Deutsche Boerse up 2.1%, after the CEO of  NYSE Euronext says there is a small chance that the planned merger with the group will materialize. On the downside, Hennes & Mauritz down 1%, as its earnings fail to please the market. With a lack of euro-zone data, eyes are on an Italian bond auction later in the day.

Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
FZ
English
(c) 2012 AII Data Processing Ltd. All Rights Reserved.
The merger between stock exchange operators  Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext is likely to fail since the majority of the  European Union's (EU) commissioners have agreed on banning the deal.
According to a media report, 25 out of the 27 commissioners have decided against the  merger.

The attempts of both companies to change the foreseeable decision of the European Commission (EC) have been in vain.
The German government had also said it was against the merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext. Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia explained on Wednesday that the merged entity would have a
monopoly on the derivatives market and so the EC undoubtedly will ban the deal on February 1.

The planned merger was announced almost a year ago. Deutsche Boerse has already paid more than EUR 100 million to external lawyers and merger advisers.

LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) -  NYSE Euronext's attempted  merger with Deutsche Boerse was "misjudged," its chief executive Duncan Niederauer told the Financial Times on Friday.

Niederauer said he "misjudged the process" in reference to the analysis taken this week by EU competition authorities to block the deal between the two dominant players in derivatives markets in Europe.

He said there was now only a "glimmer of hope" the proposal to merge the German and U.S. exchange groups would be approved by the 27 EU commissioners who must make a final call on the proposed deal by Feb. 1.

"You don't give up until the end. It certainly looks like a low probability of success. But it's not hopeless," Niederauer is quoted as saying in the article.

27 January 2012 - Duncan Niederauer, the chief executive of NYSE Euronext (NYSE:NYX) sees only a slim chance for the company’s planned USD9bn (EUR6.9bn) merger with Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) to secure the approval of the  European Commission (EC), he told the Financial Times in an interview on Friday.

Niederauer was cited by the paper as saying that he had “misjudged” the approach taken by the  EC in its analysis of the deal leading to worries that the combination would create a dominant player in  Europe’s derivatives markets.
The 27 European commissioners, set to block the transaction, are due to give their final vote by 1 February. Although no hopeless, there is a “low probability” that planned merger would win the approval of EC, Niederauer
added.
