Global economy,  US-EU trade to top agenda at G7 Rome meeting
Simon Morgan

FRANKFURT, July 6 (AFP) - G7 finance ministers meeting in Rome on Saturday are likely to discuss ways of steering the global economy back to a path of growth, especially after the decision by the  European Central Bank Thursday not to cut its key rates to help revive the ailing  euro-zone economy.

Also high on the agenda will be the growing risk of a new trade war between the United States and Europe following an EU Commission decision this week to block the planned mega-merger of US giants General Electric  and Honeywell,  and ongoing tensions between the two regions over steel, analysts here said.

The ECB said that none of its top officials were scheduled to attend the one-day meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven most industrialised nations.

But the pow-wow in Rome comes just two days after the regular fortnightly of the ECB in Frankfurt, at which the bank once again resisted pressure to cut its key interest rates as a means of kick- starting the euro-zone economy and consequently stabilising the slumping global economy.

The appropriateness or not of ECB's monetary policy is therefore likely to be very much on the minds of participants at the Rome meeting, even if they refrain from making their feelings known in public, economists said.

The US Federal Reserve has slashed its key rates six times this year to prevent the world's powerhouse economy from slipping into recession. By contrast, the ECB has trimmed a mere quarter of a percentage point off its own
key rates.
The European bank argues that inflation is currently too high to allow for a reduction in the cost of borrowing.
Its overriding task is to keep inflation in check rather than take any active measures to kick-start the economy, the
ECB argues.

And the current level of interest rates was "appropriate" for curbing inflation and was likely to remain so "for some time to come," ECB chief Wim Duisenberg said on Thursday.
In fact, had the ECB cut rates, area-wide inflation would not fall back below 2.0 percent, he suggested.

However, despite the ECB's latest decision to hold rates steady, finance ministers are likely to hold their tongues, at least in public, because they will not want to be seen to interfere with the bank's fiercely-guarded independence.
"The politicians are clever enough to realise that putting pressure on the ECB won't achieve anything, even if the
US have made it clear they'd prefer lower rates in Europe," said Commerzbank economist Christoph Weil.
Industrial Bank of Japan economist Ulla Kochwasser agreed.

"The ministers will only discuss ECB policy internally and not state publicly what they believe the bank should be doing," she said.
ECB chief Duisenberg insisted Thursday that he did not listen to "outside advice" on monetary policy decisions. Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders, a vocal supporter of rate cuts, had attended the meeting this week in
his capacity as head of Ecofin, which comprises the 15 European Union finance ministers.

Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein economist Eckhard Schulte said that exchange rates were not likely to figure highly at the meeting, since the euro appears to have stabilised at present.
"It's no big issue at the moment and the different positions are already well known," Schulte said.

Ray Attrill, director of analysis at 4Cast in London, said that Japan's economic and financial reforms could be touched on. But coming so soon after a US-Japan summit at the weekend, the G7 meeting in Rome will probably not come up with "anything fresh here, just further praise for Japan's reform agenda and encouragement for them to press ahead post haste".
Attrill did suggest, however, that trade could feature prominently, especially after the EU blocked the proposed
GE- Honeywell merger earlier this week.

The action in Brussels was the first time that a US corporate merger has been blocked solely by EU authorities and risks opening new sores in relations between Europe and the US.

Those relations have recently become strained following the US threat of possible protectionist measures to help its steel industry.
"There is a quite serious risk of a new trade war between the United States and Europe," Attrill argued. spm/bm

EU's blessing denied
Americans got a glimpse of a downside of economic globalization this week, when European regulators
condemned the proposed $45 billion  merger of General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International.

Call us suspicious, but is there any chance the EU's desire to preserve competition in the aerospace industry might have been motivated by the desire to protect Europe's public investment in Airbus, at the expense of its American rival Boeing?

The EU's prohibition was its second involving the planned merger of two American companies, though it was the first time the EU solely blocked a merger. Here's hoping it won't launch a regulatory arms race.
Children at stake

Nearly half the staffs at the two branches of the Boys & Girls Clubs of South Central Kansas, on East 21st Street and South Clifton Avenue, have been axed to help cope with a budget bind. As a result, the nonprofit organiza tion's challenging mission - to be a safe, positive place for kids to learn and have fun - has become even more so. Among other things, the cutbacks will mean less of the one-on-one attention that can be so crucial to a child's life.

That's not good. And that's where the community needs to come in. It's up to citizens, businesses and foundations, in partnership with a new group of Friends of the Boys & Girls Club, to fill a fund-raising gap and extend the precious organization's life.
To find out how to help, call (316) 687-5437. Sanctions lack sanity
The proposed "smart sanctions" against Iraq lost out to the miserable status quo this week in the United Nations. That's a win for Russia, which opposed the better-targeted sanctions in order to protect its status as Iraq's best business partner. But it's a big loss for the tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis who've suffered as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has failed to meet his obligation to use oil proceeds to buy humanitarian goods.

Because Iraq still refuses to allow U.N. weapons inspectors into the country, there's no end in sight for some kind of sanctions. That's why the United States and Great Britain must continue to press for smarter ones, which also would benefit American businesses and farmers by opening Iraqi to nonmilitary goods.
Lives - and livelihoods - are at stake. Too much local control
If you thought the state's revenue shortfall was just a Topeka problem, think again.

Because of an underfunded state budget, Sedgwick County's judicial district has to cut almost $74,000 from its budget. Other state funding problems are affecting local schools, jails and foster-care providers.



Page 7 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
We know that the Republican-dominated Legislature believes in local control. But that shouldn't include underfunded budgets.
Center stage solution

Members of the local theater community reacted in anger recently when the Wichita Center for the Arts passed on asking Tom Frye to direct a third season of theater at the center. They assumed that the decision meant the end for theater at the center; to be sure, theater production has had a complicated relationship with the center's board and management over the past decade, one that could be as stressed offstage as it was sterling onstage.

But center officials now have done what they said they'd do - hire a new director. And their choice was John Boldenow, who is among the city's most gifted directors and character actors and also has extensive national credits. Mr. Boldenow also seems a natural fit with the center's new partner, the Wichita Children's Theatre & Dance Center.

What looks like a positive resolution to the painful situation leaves us with a question: Now, can't we all just get along?
For Japan's eyes only

It's tempting to make fun of Disney's revision of its revisionist "Pearl Harbor" for Japanese moviegoers, especially with publicity fliers subtitling it "Love in Tokyo." The $140 million war movie was, after all, not so much a docudrama about FDR's "date which will live in infamy" as it was the attempt at a sequel to "Titanic."

But what Disney has done to make "Pearl Harbor" more palatable to Japanese audiences is distortion to the point of dishonesty. A speech about America's victory is gone, as are some ethnic vulgarities. And the marketing strategy is heavy on the romance, light on the death and destruction.

This kinder, gentler play to boost the film's international box-office receipts might be harmless, if not for the way it serves Japan's enduring denial of its World War II offenses. And the timing is regrettable, given growing nationalism in Japan and recent discussion about reconstituting its armed forces.
Too bad Disney let its penchants for fantasy and profits get the better of the truth. THE WICHITA EAGLE Our View

Honeywell  Stock Price Rises As Bossidy Takes the Helm

Lawrence A. Bossidy, the new chairman and chief executive of  Honeywell  International Inc., began work yesterday in the face of some tough news: a disappointing quarterly earnings forecast and the official  European Union rejection of Honeywell's  merger with GE.

Investors responded by bidding  Honeywell's  stock up by $1.59 a share, to $36.50, signaling their  approval  of the management shake-up that put Bossidy in charge. Bossidy is the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., a manufacturer of engineering materials and aerospace and automotive products that bought Honeywell  and assumed its name in 1999.

He was named Tuesday night by Honeywell's board of directors to replace Michael R. Bonsignore, who presided over the ill-starred merger negotiations with General Electric Co. and the European Commission, the EU's executive body.

But Bossidy, a former right-hand man to GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch, won't have an easy time playing doctor to the jilted bride.

Honeywell estimated second-quarter revenue of $6 billion, down from the record $6.3 billion in sales it racked up during the same period last year. Forecasted quarterly earnings per share of 53 cents to 55 cents did not meet Wall Street's expectations and were significantly lower than the 76 cents a share reported last year.

His first task will be to improve poor operating margins. Hugh Johnson, an analyst at First Albany Corp., said he was happy the deal did not go through because Honeywell's 10 percent pretax operating margin compares poorly with GE's 15 percent margin. Not only will Bossidy have to oversee a shift in corporate culture toward financial accountability, said Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Nicholas Heymann, but he will also have to resign himself to the fact that "gargantuan" mergers on the scale of the GE deal just are not a viable option anymore.

Heymann said bite-size pieces of the company will appeal to more buyers and garner more combined cash than selling the entire business at one time. Just as important, antitrust regulators will have less wiggle room to demand large divestitures, he said.

Bossidy has to work quickly to make sure Honeywell isn't left out in the cold, given the enormous restructuring underway in the rest of the industry, with a number of competitors merging and streamlining operations, said analysts.

"There's a trade-off between time taken to put Honeywell back on track and the diminishing value of its assets as other companies consolidate around it," Heymann said.

He added that Honeywell would be ill-advised to pursue a suit against GE for walking away too easily from the merger. Any such suit would invite an appeal by GE. Honeywell's assets would then be frozen, preventing it from seeking other buyers.

Meanwhile, the debate over who is to blame for the death of the $41 billion deal with GE has given rise to some transatlantic sparring.

Charles James, recently appointed as U.S. antitrust chief by President Bush, questioned EU merger policy in a statement Tuesday, implying that European regulators were more concerned with European companies' profits than consumers' pockets.

"Clear and long-standing U.S. antitrust policy holds that antitrust laws protect competition, not competitors. Today's EU decision reflects a significant point of divergence," James said.

James's comments were the first public reaction from a senior Justice official to the EU's decision to block the proposed merger between the two American companies. His remarks pointedly countered the conclusions the European Commission cited to justify its decision to prohibit the deal.

"The merger . . . would have severedly reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.
The Justice Department's assessment of the deal, however, was just the opposite.

"Our conclusion was based on finding that . . . the combined firm could offer better products and services at more attractive prices than either firm could offer individually," James said. "That, in our view, is the essence of competition."

Loggerheads: Mario Monti, Central Planner
By Brian M. Carney

BRUSSELS -- Mario  Monti is an unlikely villain. Soft-spoken and reserved, he betrays no desire to be thrust into the limelight. But under Mr.  Monti's tenure as the  European Union's CompetitionCommissioner, he and his merger task force have become the most prominent symbols of the rising importance of something called "Europe."

Most recently, Mr. Monti has raised a ruckus with his  merger task force's decision to block the $42 billion  merger of General Electric  and Honeywell.  Mr. Monti says this decision is the first instance in which a  merger that had received regulatory approval  in Washington was shot down in Brussels. On Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust chief, Charles James, lambasted the decision, declaring that it marked a "significant divergence." U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went even further, calling the  Commission's decision "off the wall" and saying something needed to be done to bring the  EU back into line.

That divergence is often put down to an American emphasis on the consumer and a European preoccupation with protecting competitors. This is right as far as it goes, but it is more a description than an explanation of the problem. The causes are deeply embedded in the laws that govern antitrust enforcement on either side of the Atlantic.

If Mr. Monti's brief covered only European business combinations, he would probably be left in relative peace to approve this merger or reject that one. But European law gives him the power to review -- and to permit or prevent -- mergers between any companies, wherever they are based, provided they do a substantial amount of business in Europe. Non-European companies could presumably refuse to accept Mr. Monti's rulings -- but only at the cost of exiting the European market altogether. So like it or not, if a company wants to do business in Europe, it has to play by Monti's Rules.

To call them Monti's Rules, though, is a bit of a misnomer. Mr. Monti didn't write the rules -- he was an academic back home in Italy when they were crafted -- and he can't change them. But the EU's member states can, and it is to them that Mr. O'Neill should direct his call for reform.

After Mario Monti announced the European Union's rejection of the GE-Honeywell merger, the EU's competition commissioner expressed his determination "to strengthen {EU-U.S.} bilateral cooperation" to reduce the risk that regulators on opposite sides of the Atlantic would disagree in the future. In Mr. James's remarks Wednesday, he echoed Mr. Monti's call for cooperation.

This is a noble goal, and one that shows that the famously independent Mr. Monti is aware of the political dimension of the very important decisions that are made in his department. But if Mr. Monti is serious about eliminating the disparity, it will take more than improved communication.

The regulation that lays down the law that Mr. Monti must interpret and follow states that the commission "shall take into account . . . . the interests of the intermediate and ultimate consumers." So far, so good. But it goes on, and here is where the trouble arises. For the regulation states that a merger that "creates or strengthens a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded" should be rejected (emphasis added). It does not overstate the case to say that those two words -- "dominant position" -- are the heart of the difference between the EU and the U.S. on merger regulation.

With those two words, which the intergovernmental body in the EU known as the Council of Ministers read into law over a decade ago, the EU adopted an approach to merger regulation that concerns itself as much with the outcome of competition as the rules according to which it is played.

Page 11 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Instead of simply confining itself to a set of rules -- outlawing price-fixing cartels, for example -- the Commission casts a jaundiced eye on any merger that "creates or strengthens a dominant position." Even the Commission won't go so far as to say something is wrong with having achieved a position of dominance in an industry. Indeed, that dominance often indicates that a company is exceptionally well-run, or has a lower cost structure than its competitors, or is innovating and providing added value that customers want.

But, as Mr. Monti has explained it, dominance increases the opportunity and therefore the probability that abuses will result. So success comes to be seen as dangerous, and the Commission sets about trying to prevent any one company's success from getting out of hand.

The result is that it is not enough to play by the rules. If, having done so, a company bests its competitors and achieves dominance, that dominance is in effect punished by having its acquisitions blocked or having severe restrictions placed on them.

Last year, mobile-phone operator Vodafone received the green light to buy Mannesmann, an industrial giant that Vodafone bought mostly for its mobile-phone network assets. But the price of success was that Vodafone was forbidden to provide its customers discounts on roaming charges that were not extended to competitors' customers as well.

This kind of restraint of trade, which prevents Vodafone from taking full advantage of the assets it has acquired, amounts to a redistribution of wealth from Vodafone to its smaller European competitors. The three-year limit is designed to allow others to catch up through mergers or expansions of their own. Then, when everyone's equal, they'll be allowed to "compete" again.

The trouble is, in a free market companies are rarely equally matched, and when they are, they don't stay so for long. This transforms competition into a situation in which, ideally, no one can win, and then penalizes those who come out on top despite the restrictions placed on them. Thus Mr. Monti's merger task force has replaced the free market with a managed one, in which the Commission accords to itself the wisdom of knowing how many competitors a given market ought to have, what percentage of market share is "dangerous" and so on.

Now, the Commission is not so presumptuous as to simply hand down Delphic pronouncements. The merger task force conducts careful and detailed economic analyses and gathers evidence in support of its theories. But if analyses and theories thought up in advance could determine the appropriate structure of a given market or the "correct" allocation of resources, there would be no need for competition at all. Central planning would do just
fine.

Central planning does not do just fine; it does quite badly, because it always lacks at least some of the information that the market is constantly uncovering through responses to price changes and technological advances and innumerable other factors that no model can anticipate.

As it stands now, the Commission has put itself in the position of trying to determine the optimal number of competitors in the wireless market or exactly how many products GE can sell before customer convenience turns into abuse or any number of other outcomes that it fears could lead to abuse.

The most obvious way of climbing down from its role as central planner is sticking to pursuing to actual violations of the law. This change can be codified by eliminating the sections of the Council regulation that require the use of the "dominant position" standard in evaluating mergers, and retaining only the consumer harm language.

Although still some way off, this is not quite the pipe dream it may first appear. The Commission itself, as Mr. Monti has made clear, has little control over the standards set for it. And within the Council, sources close to the matter say that there is support from the U.K., Ireland and Mr. Monti's Italy for revising these standards. That is already a substantial start, and once the issue is on the agenda, others may also see the light.

If a change can be effected, there is hope that the Commission will be forced to move from a standard that punishes success to one that merely requires that companies not break the law. This may in turn help head off the brewing dispute over the disparity between U.S. and EU antitrust enforcement. It is an idea whose time has come.

Blocked  air merger leaves Honeywell  in limbo.

THE EUROPEAN Commission's decision this week to block the #28.5bn buy-out of US electronics firm Honeywell  by General Electric  marks the first time a proposed  merger between two US companies has been quashed solely by European regulators.

According to a statement from the  Commission, the merger 'would have severely reduced  competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers.'

The Commission investigation concluded that GE already had a dominant position in the jet engine market and that combining with avionics supplier Honeywell could stifle competition through potential 'bundling' of products.

The deal was opposed by the UK aero engine maker Rolls-Royce as well as Rockwell International and United Technologies, which claimed the merger would create a company dominant in aero engines - a claim that won the support of the Commission.

A Rolls-Royce spokesman said on Wednesday: 'We note the decision. We made a submission about a very small part of the merged company, concerning the preservation of competition in the aero engines sector.'

GE said that the Commission took a 'fundamentally different approach to competitive issues than its counterparts in the US, Canada and nearly a dozen other jurisdictions'.

The decision hinged on the ability of General Electric to use its plane leasing division (the largest in the world) to dominate the market for jet engines and avionics systems. The Commission argued that this division could give the combined group an unfair advantage, insisting on the use of GE/Honeywell equipment on its planes.

The group could have undercut rivals by 'bundling' the sales of jet engines, cockpit control systems and the credit needed to finance purchases, said the Commission.

The future of Honeywell now looks uncertain, with United Technologies, which has previously made an offer to buy the company, likely to think long and hard before stepping forward once more as a potential bidder.

Let's call a spade a spade.  GE failed to do its homework in not anticipating  Europeans'  concerns in its proposed
merger with Honeywell.

When GE was invited to a forum last October where Mario Monti, the European commissioner for competition, spoke on "Competition for a Globalized Economy; the European Union Perspective," GE demurred with the explanation that policymakers come to  GE, and not the other way around.
Such hubris catches up with even the GEs of this world. NOEL V. LATEEF.

Regulatory issues block General Electric  and United Airlines deals

The European Commission has, as anticipated, blocked the proposed takeover of  Honeywell  by United States giant General Electric  (GE), despite the company agreeing a revised offer which would have seen it divest part of its interest in leasing arm  GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS).
Following a comprehensive review of the proposed transaction the European Commission has ruled that the
merger would "strengthen or create a dominant position in several markets" and has rejected the transaction.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," says the European competition commissioner, Mario Monti.

GE`s plans to acquire Honeywell in a tax-free merger, which would have established the merged company as one of the world`s top five aerospace organisations, were first placed in disarray last month after the European Commission demanded that the company made additional cut-backs to support competitive concerns.

The ownership of GE's leasing arm GECAS was an important part of this and following the Commission's earlier statement, GE had offered to sell a twenty percent stake in the company to meet the requirements of the antitrust agency.

However, the company made a number of additional cuts to its proposed divestiture list to remedy the situation and the European competition ruled that the new package could not be accepted. According to the Commission the revised agreement did not resolve the problems identified in a sufficiently clear way.

"There were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed, says Monti. I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns."

With the United States regulatory authorities approving the transaction earlier this year GE says it is "deeply disappointed" by the decision of the European authority stating that it strongly disagrees with the ruling given the support it has received from other jurisdictions.

"The Commission took a fundamentally different approach to competitive issues than its counterparts in the United States, Canada and nearly a dozen other jurisdictions, which approved the acquisition with few, if any conditions," says the company.
United and US Air to end talks

Meanwhile the strong position taken by the United Sates Department of Justice (DoJ) and the United States Congress over United Airlines proposed acquisition of US Airways may result in the two airlines abandoning their plans to merge.

Although no formal statement has been announced outlining the plans of the United States majors, reports, citing people familiar with the situation, claim that United is concerned over the contract and has opened talks to terminate the agreement.

The Chicago-based carrier believes that under the current economic conditions and the expected divestitures required by the Justice Department to secure antitrust approval of the transaction, to go-ahead with the deal would not be in the best interests of the company.

Under the existing takeover deal United Airlines holds an option to break away from its obligations to US Airways on 1st August subject to a the payment of a breakup fee of US$50 million.

With both United Airlines and US Airways reporting poor first quarter results earlier this year it will be important for them to introduce new contingency plans to meet with their future as independent operations.

Another  U.S. Official  Says EU Blew GE Call --- Drumbeat Persists  Over Denial of Merger

WASHINGTON -- Charles James, the U.S. antitrust chief, sharply criticized the  European Union for rejecting   General Electric  Co.'s $43 billion (50.82 billion euros) merger with Honeywell  International Inc.

"Clear and longstanding U.S.  antitrust policy holds that the  antitrust laws protect  competition, not competitors," Mr. James said. The  EU decision "reflects a significant point of divergence."

The remarks were the first by a senior Justice Department official on the failed merger, which the U.S. had approved in May. Mr. James, an assistant attorney general, was appointed by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate last month.

After an extensive investigation completed earlier this year, the antitrust division "reached a firm conclusion that the merger, as modified by the remedies we insisted upon, would have been pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers," Mr. James said. "Our conclusion was based on findings, confirmed by customers world-wide, that the combined firm could offer better products and services at more attractive prices than either firm could offer individually. That, in our view, is the essence of competition."

The EU, he said, "apparently concluded that a more diversified, and thus more competitive, GE could somehow disadvantage other market participants." As a result, "we appear to have reached different results from similar assessments of competitive conditions in the affected markets," he added.

Mr. James noted that U.S. and EU antitrust enforcers had long enjoyed a close and cooperative relationship. In fact, he said, "there were extensive consultations in this matter throughout the entire process." But, he added, this "points to the continuing need for consultation to move toward greater policy convergence."

Separately, a senior Treasury Department official said Tuesday that the matter may be discussed at the G-7 finance ministers' meeting in Rome this Saturday. But he played down any hint that the failed merger would affect wider U.S. relations with the European Union. Last week, after a speech in Detroit, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was less diplomatic. He called the decision "off the wall" and complained that there was no effective
judicial recourse for decisions by "autocratic" European antitrust enforcers.

Reaction on Capitol Hill was subdued, in part because GE made no effort to lobby the issue here. However, the rejection has crystallized the differences between U.S. and EU antitrust enforcement and raised the prospect of further divergence as Republicans assert control at the two U.S. antitrust agencies.

Some senators are considering hearings on the move, but aides said Tuesday no decision has been made. In a recent statement, Sen. Herbert Kohl, a Democrat from Wisconsin, chairman of the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, and Sen. Mike DeWine, a Republican from Ohio, called the deal a "complicated transaction, one on which reasonable people may differ." But they added that "the stark difference in conclusions by the American and European anti-trust authorities may indicate a need for further examination of the various pro-cesses and standards used by the different agencies."

The two lawmakers warned that "uncertainty about coordination or the legal ground rules will hinder development of free and open markets."



Page 17 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Others have been more blunt. Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, a Democrat from West Virginia, chairman of the Senate aviation subcommittee, said in a recent letter to EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti that a rejection "could have a chilling effect on future trans-Atlantic aviation and aerospace cooperation." And Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings, a Democrat from South Carolina, accused the commission of "using its merger-review process as a tool to protect and promote European industry at the expense of U.S. competitors."

Mr. Monti fired back Wednesday, noting that some of the strongest objections heard by EU antitrust enforcers came from U.S.-based competitors and customers of GE and Honeywell. He also said that the U.S. has often forced changes or in some cases even blocked mergers that the EU has allowed to proceed.

David Balto, a former federal antitrust enforcer now with the law firm of White & Case in Washington, said the record bears out Mr. Monti's complaint, especially in pharmaceuticals mergers, where the U.S. demanded changes in several accords the EU approved.

"People are upset that two big American companies have gotten sideswiped for the first time by the EU, but it's really no different from what we've been doing to them for years," Mr. Balto said.

Honeywell  Installs  Bossidy as Chief Amid Merger Woes --- Company Must Now Contend With Failed GE
Agreement
By staff reporters Nikhil Deogun and Robin Sidel in New York and Matt Murray in Pittsburgh

Lawrence A. Bossidy returned this week to run beleaguered  Honeywell  International Inc. and immediately faced a host of woes, ranging from disappointing earnings to the prospects of a legal battle against  merger partner General Electric  Co., Mr. Bossidy's onetime employer.

Against the backdrop of the  European Commission's official  rejection of GE's $43 billion acquisition and yet another Honeywell  profit warning, the board ousted Michael R. Bonsignore, 60 years old, as  Honeywell chairman and chief executive, thanking him for his 31 years of service. As expected, the board replaced him with Mr. Bossidy, 66, former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which merged with  Honeywell  in late
1999.

After its three-hour meeting, Honeywell's board made no comment about potential litigation against GE. The merger agreement remains in effect and technically could stand until Nov. 30, the "walkaway date," but keeping it in place restricts Honeywell's ability to make major business decisions without consulting GE. Honeywell's board is debating whether to officially terminate the deal. It also must decide whether to sue GE for allegedly failing to use its "reasonable best efforts" to win antitrust approval for the deal as required in the merger agreement.

In a conference call with reporters, Mr. Bossidy, who was contacted by the board three weeks ago to take over as chairman and CEO, said the company was considering its legal options and would make a decision "sooner
rather than later."

Honeywell disclosed the profit warning and the management switch Tuesday evening. At 1 p.m. Tuesday in New York trading, Honeywell shares were up 2.9%, or 99 cents, at $35.10 on news of Mr. Bossidy's impending return, which had been reported in that day's edition of The Wall Street Journal. GE shares were down 69 cents at
$49.51 at 1 p.m. Tuesday in New York trading. In 4 p.m. trading Wednesday, Honeywell shares ended at $35.09, up 98 cents and GE shares ended at $49.52, down 69 cents.

Investors were optimistic Mr. Bossidy, a onetime vice chairman of GE who made a name for himself producing stellar earnings during nine years at the helm of AlliedSignal, was the right person to turn around Honeywell. Known as a demanding boss, Mr. Bossidy has a reputation for being focused on the bottom line and on Tuesday termed himself an "ideal candidate" to lead Honeywell.

This time around, though, Mr. Bossidy faces some unique challenges. The company never has been fully integrated following the Honeywell-AlliedSignal deal, and it still faces a bloated cost structure and tensions between the two camps.

The biggest challenge may be boosting morale and keeping people. A number of executives have left or are on the way out as a result of plans to merge with GE, and Mr. Bossidy said Tuesday that he wants to do his best to "retain these good people."

Despite constant speculation about an offer for Honeywell from spurned suitor United Technologies Corp., Mr. Bossidy, who was hired under a one-year contract, said the "idea is to stay independent for now, and at some point in the future the company may consider" a merger again. "It's time to forget the past and what might have been" and focus on the future, added Mr. Bossidy.



Page 19 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
That may be easier said than done, since Honeywell is facing a bleak earnings outlook. The company said it expects second-quarter revenue to be $6 billion, with "ongoing earnings" between 53 cents and 55 cents a share
-- well below analysts' estimates of 60 cents a share. That earnings forecast excludes a pretax charge of $575 million to $625 million to cover merger-related expenses, legal fees and asset impairments, among other costs. For last year's second quarter, Honeywell reported net income of $617 million, or 76 cents a share, on revenue of
$6.31 billion.

Analysts and investors said Mr. Bossidy shares the blame for last year's earnings woes, since many of the problems were from the old AlliedSignal businesses.

Mr. Bossidy and the board also need to make a decision on whether to pursue a lawsuit against GE. The board needs to show its shareholders that directors are doing everything possible to protect the rights of Honeywell shareholders under the merger agreement.
But the merits of a lawsuit are unclear, and Honeywell may be entering uncharted territory.

A "reasonable best efforts" clause is common in merger agreements, but courts seldom have considered the true meaning of the phrase because parties involved in failed takeovers usually settle their differences out of court.

Under the agreement, GE is required to use reasonable best efforts to win antitrust approval and agree to certain measures, such as divestitures, so long as those measures don't result in a "material adverse effect" on Honeywell's business.

He has his finger on a nuclear button.

The EU's trade commissioner with a finger on a nuclear button

THIS week's refusal by the European Union to countenance the  merger of two giant American companies, Honeywell  and General Electric,  has already caused outrage in the United States (see article). But even before this new source of friction came between the world's two biggest trading blocks, a "nuclear device" was ticking below them, and Pascal Lamy, the  EU's trade commissioner, has had his finger on the button. Lest this sound a touch melodramatic, be it said that the image is not Charlemagne's. It was Robert Zoellick, Mr Lamy's American opposite number and friend, who used it when discussing the possibility that the  EU might impose billions of dollars of trade sanctions in its challenge to the United States' "foreign sales corporation" tax code, which it sees as a subsidy to American exporters.

Last month the EU won an interim ruling against the code at the World Trade Organisation. But getting it dismantled may prove tricky. Neither the Bush administration nor Congress is famed for tolerance of multilateral constraints on American freedom of action; the EU's decision to block the General Electric-Honeywell merger will hardly encourage them to comply with the WTO ruling. So the time may come when the EU could, in theory, slap up to $4 billion of sanctions on American exports. Since the case is still before the WTO, Mr Lamy will not discuss how itchy his finger may be. And, of course, the commission could not launch a war of mutually assured destruction-for such it would be-on its own: it would have to get Europe's political leaders behind it. But Mr Lamy's views will count.

The fact that he is a French Socialist will not reassure those in Washington who think the EU is spoiling for a fight. But Mr Lamy is no stereotypical American-bashing Frenchman. Keenly aware of American politics, he talks knowledgeably of the need to woo Congress and calls up a website to illustrate the exact progress of the confirmation hearings for George Bush's new appointees. In both work and leisure habits, he inclines more to American-style workaholism than to the 35-hour week that is now the law in his own country: the long hours he puts in are notorious, and his idea of relaxation is to run the New York marathon. Oh, and he speaks impeccable English.

Mr Lamy himself pointedly refrains from resorting to America-bashing. "I know the easiest way to get a cheer in Brussels is to stand up in the European Parliament and denounce America," he says, "but that's why you need telephone diplomacy, not megaphone diplomacy." He is proud that he and Mr Zoellick recently settled the
long-running dispute over bananas. And, like the Americans, he sounds both keen and optimistic over the biggest trade question, whether this year will see the launch of a new round of world trade talks. But on one of the thorniest issues, agriculture, he is all European. Jacques Delors, the French former head of the European Commission, once remarked during a previous trade round that he would not sacrifice the French countryside on the altar of free trade. Mr Lamy, who was Mr Delors's chief of staff, stands firmly in this tradition.

Agriculture, he insists, cannot be seen as just another economic sector; it has a wider social significance. If European food prices were allowed to fall to world levels, he reckons that the EU would lose 5m of its 7m farmers. Alarmingly-given Japan's notorious protectionism-he sees strong affinities between European and Japanese attitudes to farming. Both cultures are concerned with food security, he says; both abhor a wilderness and believe that land is there to be cultivated. Of course, he agrees, agriculture will figure large in a new trade round. But, given his views, it is hard to foresee much progress on it.

Mr Lamy's approach will disappoint free-traders. But it may still go too far for many in his natural political tribe, the French left. One of the loudest voices of the anti-globalisation movement is Jose Bove, a French farmer. Asked if he sympathises with Mr Bove, Mr Lamy-after a long pause-gives an anodyne reply: Mr Bove raises good questions but has the wrong answers.

Page 21 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The same desire simultaneously to keep faith with his political base and yet adapt to current realities colours Mr
Lamy's approach to the subject that is his real passion, the future of the EU itself. As Mr Delors's former
right-hand man, he is in an ambiguous and sensitive position. Many commission staff still hark back to the glory
days of Mr Delors, when the commission drove forward European integration. Some French civil servants and
politicians also deplore the way in which an "Anglo-Saxon" emphasis on market economics has allegedly
displaced grander political and social visions of Europe's future. Mr Lamy cannot endorse such criticisms openly,
since to do so would be dangerously disloyal to his current boss, Romano Prodi, the hapless Italian head of the
commission. Yet on occasions Mr Lamy will signal his unhappiness. He fiercely opposed a recent decision not to
press for harmonisation of corporate-tax rates-something which the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, has
demanded. Mr Lamy is unrepentant in his opposition to the current commission line, insisting that "I definitely
think fiscal competition should not take place."

His critics in Brussels, and there are plenty, will take such statements as proof of their suspicion that, for all his talk of Europe, Mr Lamy is ultimately a French nationalist, pushing a distinctly Gallic-more precisely, Gaullist-view of Europe's future. Maybe. But then commissioners in Brussels who happen to be British or German also often promote ideas that reflect their national prejudices. And when it comes to wearing his trade hat, Mr Lamy's background on the French left may even prove an advantage. Just as it used to be said that only a right-wing Republican like Richard Nixon could reconcile the United States with China, so it may take a French Socialist to reconcile Europe to a new round of trade liberalisation.

Mario Monti has blocked  the biggest-ever industrial merger. Now he needs to put his own house in order.

Mario Monti has blocked the biggest-ever industrial  merger. Now he needs to put his own house in order

WHEN Mario  Monti became the European Union's competition commissioner in 1999, Karel Van Miert, his distinguished predecessor, telephoned to congratulate him: "Now you will have to get used to being thought of as the most powerful man in Europe," quipped Mr Van Miert. On July 3rd the European Commission blocked the
$42 billion proposed merger between General Electric  (GE) and Honeywell  on Mr Monti's recommendation. He could be forgiven for wanting to call Mr Van Miert back to say he was bang on, except that these days his stage is no longer European but global.

A look at Mr Monti's output on July 3rd reveals just how global and powerful his position has become. In addition to the GE/Honeywell decision, he found time to open an investigation into a merger of Brazilian iron-ore groups; to impose tough measures on IMS Health, an American health-information firm that stands accused of abusing a dominant market position in Germany; and to allow one European acquisition and one German joint venture to proceed.

It is GE/Honeywell, however, that has made the soft-spoken Mr Monti's reputation as the world's toughest regulator. It took strong nerves to block the deal, for surely Mr Monti's stance betokens a worrying split between Europe and America. After all, in May the deal was waved through quickly by America's Department of Justice (DoJ). GE confidently expected the same result in Europe. But Mr Monti calmly resisted huge pressure, noting that the decision to block was a "rare case where the transatlantic competition authorities have disagreed". Instead of less co-operation between authorities, he wants more. In a speech on July 4th, he called for the creation of a global annual forum at which antitrust regulators can share experiences and forge policies.

The pressure on Mr Monti is unlikely to abate quickly. President George Bush and several senators have grumbled publicly at what they see as unwarranted interference in an all-American deal, and have hinted that Mr Monti's true aim was to protect European companies. That has politicised the whole question of antitrust policy and opened a new front for transatlantic tensions. Mr Monti was at pains to say that he hoped the history of close co-operation between his team and American officials would not be jeopardised by a genuine difference of opinion. It will not be easy, however, to contain the issue if politicians decide that they want to exploit it.

A measure of Mr Monti's sense of diplomacy is that he could, if he chooses, deflect criticism of himself and his officials by throwing it straight back at the Americans. So far he has been judiciously silent on the question of whether the DoJ bungled its investigation and thereby forced the European Union to play the tough cop. He has also resisted the temptation to point out in public that American companies such as Rockwell Collins and United Technologies, rather than European firms, provided him with the main ammunition used to shoot down the merger. In at least one case, the same information was offered to the DoJ, which chose not to listen.

Plenty of observers, including Jack Welch, GE's departing chairman, have acknowledged that Mr Monti possesses a formidable combination of charm, intelligence and an ability to be polite even when he is being stubborn. A sign of his growing reputation is that he was offered the job of foreign minister in Silvio Berlusconi's new Italian government. Perhaps wisely, he preferred to stay in Brussels-although the offer points to a possible future career.

Mr Monti began his career as an economics professor and, despite what some critics say, a sound grasp of theory underpins his competition role. However, he is perhaps too relaxed when his team breaks new antitrust ground, as it did several times during the GE negotiations and in the case relating to IMS Health. In essence, the Monti approach involves teasing out the commercial realities of complex, sometimes overlapping, industries and markets. That is fine, but it relies heavily on sounding out competitors, and rather less on asking customers for

their views. Mr Monti needs to insist on a greater balance. He should also heed suggestions that his officials sometimes let their power go to their heads.

Indeed, as the range of his activities expands, Mr Monti is coming under increasing pressure to change Europe's competition procedures and to make sure that his officials stick to agreed rules and precedents. His department has to scrutinise more and more deals. Although it has expanded in recent years, it remains under-resourced. When the EU's Merger Task Force (MTF) was set up in September 1990, its 47 staff had to decide on 60 cases annually. Now it has about twice as many staff, but last year looked at 345 transactions (see chart). Mr Monti has introduced a fast-track system for uncontroversial deals to ease the load, but almost two-thirds of all cases still need detailed work.

The lack of independent assessment within the MTF is also controversial. The same officials handle a case from start to finish, often forming strong opinions during the investigative phase. That can make it impossible for them to be objective when they have to adjudicate. Mr Monti has previously acknowledged that it might be better to have officials make their case to an internal judge who has no axe to grind. But he has yet to do anything to change the current arrangements. The challenge of managing and adapting the MTF as big companies grow increasingly global is arguably a greater one than making any particular ruling, however tricky. Mr Monti will be remembered for blocking GE/Honeywell. If he listens to his critics and truly reforms Europe's competition regime, he might just win a more impressive place in history.

How the Americans helped block  GE's merger with Honeywell

WHEN he proudly announced the intended $42 billion  merger of General Electric  (GE) and Honeywell  last October, Jack Welch,  GE's chairman, made two serious errors of judgment. First, he underestimated the risk that regulators might balk at such a powerful combination. Ironically, it was the European Commission's antitrust team led by Mario Monti that eventually derailed the all-American transaction. On July 3rd, Mr Monti confirmed that he would not allow the deal to proceed, an outcome that had appeared increasingly likely in recent weeks.

Mr Welch's second error was to quip that it would be his "neck on the line" if he failed to pull off the merger. He postponed his retirement by eight months as a condition for winning Honeywell's approval of his last-minute trumping of a bid from United Technologies (UTC), another American electronics and engineering group. But with the merger blocked, Mr Welch can simply retire as planned. It turns out that Michael Bonsignore, Honeywell's chairman and chief executive, was really the boss in danger. After Mr Monti's announcement, Honeywell immediately replaced him with Larry Bossidy, a former GE manager and boss of Allied Signal, which Honeywell acquired in 1999.

In effect, Mr Bonsignore was punished for GE's failure to clinch the deal. But there is little doubt that Honeywell is in worse shape than if it had taken the less ambitious option of merging with UTC. Its main avionics business has suffered the double blow of slumping orders caused by economic downturn and operational difficulties exacerbated by the attention given to the merger. Mr Bossidy's first act was to issue a profits warning: Honeywell expects to miss its second-quarter forecast and is gloomy about the rest of this year. Its shares have slumped.

Honeywell could sue GE on the grounds that its suitor did not use the required "best efforts" to gain regulatory approval for the merger. But that seems unlikely. GE scrambled hard in recent weeks to win approval in Europe, but would not budge on central issues that would have undermined the economic case for the deal. On June 29th Mr Bonsignore wrote an open letter to Mr Welch offering to drop Honeywell's price to soothe some of GE's concerns. Mr Welch's response, also public, was politely withering.

Besides, GE also emerges from the debacle in a tricky position that will require careful tactics from Jeffrey Immelt, Mr Welch's successor. Mr Monti stated bluntly that GE and its aircraft-leasing arm, GECAS, already have a "dominant position" in some markets for jet engines. That finding opens the way for competitors to harry the conglomerate in future through conventional competition agencies. Even if it appeals, as it can, GE is likely to be stuck with this finding.

In ruling against the merger, Mr Monti has soured relations with America's Department of Justice, which cleared the merger in May, demanding only minimal disposals. Did American regulators do a proper job? Lawyers involved in the case say privately that Mr Monti's team was much more thorough in exploring the competitive dynamics of the aircraft and avionics markets. The European Commission was no doubt helped by the fact that, by the time its investigation was under way in March, GE/Honeywell's competitors, notably UTC and a fellow American company, Rockwell Collins, had woken up and mustered strong arguments against the deal. By then, the justice department had already made up its mind.

The European Commission's conclusions are clearly unpalatable to GE. But are they only what tough scrutiny would have revealed had it first occurred in America? Mr Monti, anxious to preserve transatlantic relations, was far too polite to ask this question in his own defence. But in the end it was mainly American companies, not
Europeans, that furnished him with the information that was used to justify blocking the deal. American politicians, including President George Bush, whose harrumphs have injected a nasty note into the proceedings, would do well to bear that in mind.

Globalization's Price

U.S. corporations have been some of the most ardent proponents of globalization, viewing their ever-growing entanglements with foreign nations as a key to future profitability. But as the  European Union's recent  rejection of a merger between two U.S. companies makes clear, globalization means more than profits.

The EU's decision to block  General Electric's  $41 billion acquisition of  Honeywell,  despite the deal's  approval by U.S.  regulators, should be a splash of cold water in the faces of U.S. globalists. The freewheeling, entrepreneurial spirit that built America's economy into such a juggernaut isn't shared by  EU leaders, and doing business in Europe means playing by Europe's egalitarian rules. While this has always been the case to some extent, U.S. companies now face the prospect of playing by  Europe's rules in America.

Several U.S. lawmakers are livid and mumbling about retaliation, but they should resist the urge to complain too loudly. After all, interfering in another country's business is a hoary American tradition, whether through consumer boycotts, trade sanctions or more subtle political pressures.

The EU decision should make U.S. businesses and politicians think hard, however, about the ultimate consequences of the globalization. If the EU is feeling its oats enough to smack down a U.S. business deal today, what will it do tomorrow when it is stronger and America's business roots are sunk even further into Europe?
Might the EU's leftist regulators see an opportunity to advance their social and environmental agendas overseas? ("To do business here, comrade, you must offer eight-week vacations and cut your greenhouse gases there.")

Even if it never comes to that, Americans should not expect a free ride on the global train. The payoff is a bigger market for U.S. products and services, but the price is some measure of American independence.

European regulators formally rejected General Electric  Co.'s $42-billion bid for  Honeywell  International Inc., citing fears that the combination would stifle competition for aircraft jet engines and electronic equipment.

The decision, which was expected, is likely to scuttle the largest industrial  merger ever, although  GE said it may appeal. It was the first time the European Competition Commission, a 20-member panel representing 15 countries, objected to a merger that had cleared U.S. regulatory scrutiny.

Analysts said European companies could face retaliation in their bid to acquire U.S. companies, increasing transatlantic trade tensions. The fallout was immediate at Honeywell, whose board ousted its chairman within hours of the commission decision and said the firm was looking forward to operating as an "independent company."

Merge? Yes and Non

After weeks of buildup,  European regulators formally vetoed General Electric's  $45 billion takeover of
Honeywell  International, a deal the Justice Department had approved  last month.

On one level, the opposite rulings invite a simple interpretation. The  European Commission appeared to give more weight to objections raised by competing suppliers of aircraft equipment on both sides of the Atlantic -- it seemed to act to protect the market. In constrast, in America, where dominant companies are not in themselves seen as bad, the key question was whether a  merger would substantially reduce  competition and harm consumers.

But many analysts warn that it is a mistake to infer any sweeping conclusions about European social values or American corporate Darwinism. Instead, they wonder if the European regulators will continue to invoke the kind of arcane theory that had them fretting about General Electric's ability to enhance its dominance in aircraft engines
by ''bundling'' the sale of Honeywell's electronic components and G.E.'s aircraft leasing business.

And they point out that a practical, not ideological, difference may have swayed regulators. The European Commission has great power to block mergers but little to reign in companies later. Some experts speculate that regulators felt compelled to act while they could, rather than wait until the results came in.

There's method in Monti's  madness.

'I HOPE people [will] say I was appropriately aggressive at times and appropriately cautious at times." This comment from the new chairman of America's Federal Trade Commission, Timothy J Muris, could well be seen as mirroring the attitude of the  European Union's competition czar, Mario Monti, who last week blocked the world's largest industrial takeover planned by General Electric  for aerospace specialists  Honeywell.

It should also be seen as sign of hope at a time when US politicians are making angry noises at  Europe's intervention to block a  merger already approved  in their own country. Amid talk that  Monti's stand will spark a trade war between the US and the  EU - most likely if there was further political intervention in anti-trust matters - it is heartening to hear Muris claim he believes his  European counterparts would prefer to "agree more than we disagree" and that he will use his position to challenge what he calls "dumb mergers" - in other words,
anti-competitive ones.

As it seems likely that all industrial sectors will see contentious merger attempts occurring with more frequency, both the US and European authorities will have to learn to listen and respect each other's different approaches, for example, the EU's focus on competitor companies which differs from the US interest in protecting consumer interests.

But while the different strengths of both the US and European corporate sectors and political structures should be acknowledged, they should not be used as weapons in a destructive battle for global trade supremacy.

European Regulators Block  GE-Honeywell Merger.(Brief Article)

The European Commission, meeting in Strasbourg, France, unanimously voted to block  General Electric  Co. s acquisition of Honeywell  International Inc.

This marks the first time a merger between two U.S. companies, already  approved  by American regulators, has been stopped by Europeanregulators.

According to a statement from the Commission, it "concluded that the merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns."

Competition commissioner Mario Monti said, "The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines."

A statement from GE remarked, "We strongly disagree with the Commission's conclusions about the competitive effects of GE's acquisition of Honeywell.... The facts just don't support these assertions. We believe this acquisition would have dearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service, and prices."
MULTIPLE PROPOSALS

Because of the competitive problems that were cited by the Commission, GE offered a new proposal in mid-June, but it was considered inadequate. On June 28, another plan from GE was rejected.

On June 29, Michael Bonsignore, chairman and ceo of Honeywell, sent a letter to GE making last-minute concessions to try to save the merger. But it was turned down by GE chairman and ceo Jack Welch, who responded, "What the Commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal. The new deal you propose, in response to the Commission, makes no sense for our share owners."

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said that the company was considering whether to appeal the decision. "We will consider all of our options," he said.
Regarding the difference in opinion between the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice,
Monti noted, "It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions, but each authority has to perform
its own assessment and the risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never be totally excluded.

"This does not mean that one authority is doing a technical analysis and the other pursuing a political goal, as some might pretend, but simply that we might interpret facts differently and forecast the effects of an operation in different ways."
Reportedly, some U.S. senators had suggested that blocking the deal could result in retaliation against Europe. HONEYWELL CEO REPLACED
The same day that the Commission made its decision, the board of directors of Honeywell announced that Bonsignore was retiring from the company, effective immediately. The board also announced the appointment of Lawrence A. Bossidy as chairman and ceo. Bossidy had served as chairman and ceo of Allied-Signal Corp.,
which merged with Honeywell in 1999, when he became chairman of the combined companies. He retired in April
2000.

"It is time to leave behind the distractions of the past several months and to immediately implement a laser-sharp focus on consistently meeting our financial commitments and our customers' needs," said Bossidy.
His mandate, he stated, is to "fix the company or sell it"

Some experts believe that United Technologies Corp. is preparing to revive its earlier offer for Honeywell. The company was outbid by GE after it was near completion of a deal.

Your articles on the future of  antitrust do an excellent job of summarizing the issues facing the Bush administration on the Microsoft case, though you fail to mention one factor: the newly- emergent  European Union Competition Commission. The EU competition authorities' philosophy is to stop companies from abusing market power by disapproving mergers that might allow such abuses. By contrast, the U.S. has relied heavily on the availability of post-  merger deterrents to control abuses.

The administration likely will not want to hand Commissioner Mario Monti and his Competition Commission an easy public victory on the  GE- Honeywell  merger by appearing to validate  EU concerns that the U.S. antitrust laws do not provide effective remedies for such abuses.

Loggerheads: Mario Monti, Central Planner

BRUSSELS -- Mario  Monti is an unlikely villain. Soft-spoken and reserved, he betrays no desire to be thrust into the limelight. But under Mr.  Monti's tenure as the  European Union's competitioncommissioner, he and his merger task force have become the most prominent symbols of the rising importance of something called "Europe."

Most recently, Mr. Monti has raised a ruckus with his  merger task force's decision to block the $42 billion  merger of General Electric  and Honeywell.  Mr. Monti says this decision is the first instance in which a  merger that had received regulatory approval  in Washington was shot down in Brussels. Last Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust chief, Charles James, lambasted the decision, declaring that it marked a "significant divergence." U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went even further, calling the  Commission's decision "off the wall" and saying something needed to be done to bring the  EU back into line.

That divergence is often put down to an American emphasis on the consumer and a European preoccupation with protecting competitors. This is right as far as it goes, but it is more a description than an explanation of the problem. The causes are deeply embedded in the laws that govern antitrust enforcement on either side of the Atlantic.

If Mr. Monti's brief covered only European business combinations, he would probably be left in relative peace to approve this merger or reject that one. But European law gives him the power to review -- and to permit or prevent -- mergers between any companies, wherever they are based, provided they do a substantial amount of business in Europe. Non-European companies could presumably refuse to accept Mr. Monti's rulings -- but only at the cost of exiting the European market altogether. So like it or not, if a company wants to do business in Europe, it has to play by Monti's Rules.

To call them Monti's Rules, though, is a bit of a misnomer. Mr. Monti didn't write the rules -- he was an academic back home in Italy when they were crafted -- and he can't change them. But the EU's member states can, and it is to them that Mr. O'Neill should direct his call for reform.

After Mario Monti announced the European Union's rejection of the GE-Honeywell merger, the EU's competition commissioner expressed his determination "to strengthen [EU-U.S.] bilateral cooperation" to reduce the risk that regulators on opposite sides of the Atlantic would disagree in the future. In Mr. James's remarks Wednesday, he echoed Mr. Monti's call for cooperation.

This is a noble goal, and one that shows that the famously independent Mr. Monti is aware of the political dimension of the decisions that are made in his department. But if Mr. Monti is serious about eliminating the disparity, it will take more than improved communication.

The regulation that lays down the law that Mr. Monti must interpret and follow states that the commission "shall take into account . . . . the interests of the intermediate and ultimate consumers." So far, so good. But it goes on, and here is where the trouble arises. For the regulation states that a merger that "creates or strengthens a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded" should be rejected. It does not overstate the case to say that those two words -- "dominant position" -- are the heart of the difference between the EU and the U.S. on merger regulation.

With those two words, which the intergovernmental body in the EU known as the Council of Ministers read into law over a decade ago, the EU adopted an approach to merger regulation that concerns itself as much with the outcome of competition as the rules according to which it is played.

Page 35 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Instead of simply confining itself to a set of rules -- outlawing price-fixing cartels, for example -- the Commission casts a jaundiced eye on any merger that "creates or strengthens a dominant position." Even the Commission won't go so far as to say something is wrong with having achieved a position of dominance in an industry. Indeed, dominance often indicates that a company is well-run, or has a lower cost structure than its competitors, or is innovating and providing added value that customers want.

But, as Mr. Monti has explained it, dominance increases the opportunity and therefore the probability that abuses will result. So success comes to be seen as dangerous, and the Commission sets about trying to prevent any one company's success from getting out of hand.

The result is that it is not enough to play by the rules. If, having done so, a company bests its competitors and achieves dominance, that dominance is in effect punished by having its acquisitions blocked or having severe restrictions placed on them.

Last year, mobile-phone operator Vodafone received the green light to buy Mannesmann, an industrial giant that Vodafone bought mostly for its mobile-phone network assets. But the price of success was that Vodafone was forbidden to provide its customers discounts on roaming charges that were not extended to competitors' customers as well.

This kind of restraint of trade, which prevents Vodafone from taking full advantage of the assets it has acquired, amounts to a redistribution of wealth from Vodafone to its smaller European competitors. The three-year limit is designed to allow others to catch up through mergers or expansions of their own. When everyone's equal, they'll be allowed to "compete" again.

The trouble is, in a free market companies are rarely equally matched, and when they are, they don't stay so for long. This transforms competition into a situation in which, ideally, no one can win, and then penalizes those who come out on top despite the restrictions placed on them. Thus Mr. Monti's merger task force has replaced the free market with a managed one, in which the Commission accords to itself the wisdom of knowing how many competitors a given market ought to have, what percentage of market share is "dangerous" and so on.

Now, the Commission is not so presumptuous as to simply hand down Delphic pronouncements. The merger task force conducts careful and detailed economic analyses and gathers evidence in support of its theories. But if analyses and theories thought up in advance could determine the appropriate structure of a given market or the "correct" allocation of resources, there would be no need for competition at all. Central planning would do just
fine.

Central planning does not do just fine; it does quite badly, because it always lacks at least some of the information that the market is constantly uncovering through responses to price changes and technological advances and innumerable other factors that no model can anticipate.

As it stands now, the Commission has put itself in the position of trying to determine the optimal number of competitors in the wireless market or exactly how many products GE can sell before customer convenience turns into abuse or any number of other outcomes that it fears could lead to abuse.

The most obvious way of climbing down from its role as central planner is sticking to pursuing to actual violations of the law. This change can be codified by eliminating the sections of the Council regulation that require the use of the "dominant position" standard in evaluating mergers, and retaining only the consumer harm language.

Although still some way off, this is not quite the pipe dream it may first appear. The Commission itself, as Mr. Monti has made clear, has little control over the standards set for it. And within the Council, sources close to the matter say that there is support from the U.K., Ireland and Mr. Monti's Italy for revising these standards. That is already a substantial start, and once the issue is on the agenda, others may also see the light.

If a change can be effected, there is hope that the Commission will be forced to move from a standard that punishes success to one that merely requires that companies not break the law. This may in turn help head off the brewing dispute over the disparity between U.S. and EU antitrust enforcement. It is an idea whose time has come.

Letters to the Editor:  Some Lessons  Needed In a Few Market Basics

Now that  EC Competition Commissioner Mario Monti has finally won his game in stopping the  GE-Honeywell merger, only a couple of details need be added to "GE-Honeywell  Exposes Flaws in  Antitrust Policy" (article, June 26). First, the  regulator-bureaucrats of the Joel Klein and Mario  Monti stripe do not have a proper understanding of entrepreneurial  competition. They have never worked in industry, particularly highly
competitive sectors. Rather than having to live and die by their wits, energy and competitive drive, they hold out of date notions of business order.

Second, it's a shame that GE Chairman Jack Welch didn't simply ignore the European Commission by going ahead with the merger of two U.S. firms. Only the most naive European could think that the likes of Lufthansa or SwissAir could be held back from GE engines if those were determined best for their planes. And finally, the
60,000 jobs of a combined GE-Honeywell could easily have been moved to Ireland, Israel and perhaps Brazil, to the benefit of European education in antitrust matters.

AMERICA'S BIG MARRIAGE PLANS ARE FAILING TO GET AS FAR AS THE ALTAR.
By LAUREN CHAMBLISS.

A tougher  regulatory and economic environment in the US is taking a toll on corporate marriages. Not only are fewer acquisitions being proposed but a larger percentage of suitors are baling out at the last minute. So far this year, 176 merger deals in America have been withdrawn, a rate that is about a third higher than this time last year.

The reasons vary. General Electric  would be happy to walk down the aisle with  Honeywell  if the European Union's competition regulators would let it. Tyson Food got a severe case of "buyer's regret" and tried to back out of a $3.2 billion (#2.3 billion) marriage with meatpacker IBP until a Delaware court forced it to the altar. Consolidated Edison and Northeast Utilities are battling in court over which partner is responsible for wrecking their planned $3.8 billion  merger.

Compaq Computer and food products company HJ Heinz attempted to make acquisitions to expand their businesses but were topped by higher bids from elsewhere. In the mergers and acquisitions heyday at the end of the last decade, a rival offer would usually ignite a bidding war but in today's harsh economic climate suitors are more likely to walk than add to the dowry, analysts say. Corporate buyers are less willing to take a risk and increase the cost of the transaction.

"There has been a big pick-up in the number of deals falling through," says Richard Peterson, merger tracker for Thomson Financial. "There are a variety of reasons that generally boil down to an inhospitable economic environment coupled with increased regulatory scrutiny."

Officials said that United Airlines grounded its $60-a-share offer for US Airways because Washington anti-trust regulators were demanding too many concessions on the deal, which would have combined two of America's largest carriers and squeezed competition.

Analysts say the rapidly sinking economic environment probably also had a lot to do with it. United lost $300 million in the first quarter, squeezed by rising energy and labour costs and sluggish travel demand. It is not in the best position to absorb a troubled rival with a history of labour strife.

When United first announced the deal more than a year ago, both it and the industry were in much better shape. This week, United's share price had its biggest gain in months as investors expressed relief the merger was aborted.

Being rejected can be devastating for the company left standing at the altar. US Airways' shares plunged 30% last week to a 52-week low after United called off the marriage, citing anti-trust concerns.

US Airways has had a long, troubled history with combinations. The East Coast carrier was partially owned by British Airways in the Nineties and that combination didn't work out as planned. BA was lucky to get out when it did, analysts believe.

United's hesitation comes at a time when merger activity has slowed sharply from its earlier record pace. Announced mergers and acquisitions activity is off 55% from a year ago. The number of deals at the mid-year point is $382 billion, down from $878 billion during the first six months of last year, according to Thomson Financial.

It isn't just American firms that are getting cold feet, however. Foreign acquisitions of US companies are also well off the pace they were at last year. Foreigners have announced plans to buy $74.6 billion worth of corporate America so far in 2001, about half of the $145.4 billion at this time last year.

At the heart of the controversial decision by the  European Union to reject the proposed merger between General Electric  and Honeywell  is a basic cultural conflict with the United States. Namely, the Europeans  still believe strongly in the wisdom of government economic planning and state ownership, while the United States has turned decisively toward market-based decision-making and private property rights as the most efficient means of allocating resources and promoting economic growth.

The GE-Honeywell decision itself is merely another symptom of this ongoing cultural clash. Because EU antitrust czar Mario Monti does not trust markets, he felt compelled to step in and disallow the corporate merger on the dubious ground that the new business combination would impair "competition." What he really meant, however, is that the proposed merger might hinder European corporations that are afraid to compete with American firms in a level playing field marketplace. In a word, the Mario Monti decision sounds like more Euro-whining over U.S.
world business leadership.

Europe nearly always opts to protect its existing corporations, including those companies that are wholly or partly government-owned. Protecting inefficient businesses, however, usually comes at the expense of consumers and investors. Just one day after the GE-Honeywell decision, for example, the European Parliament voted against important measures that would have liberalized the Continental economy and its financial markets by forcing corporate management to consult shareholders about takeover bids.

As a result, foreign investment capital will not be permitted to flow freely into Europe. But it is precisely foreign capital inflows that raise the level of global competition and force domestic firms to downsize, restructure and become more productive. Remember the Japanese auto invasion of the United States in the 1980s? All those Toyota and Nissan car plants forced the U.S. Big Three carmakers to modernize. Europe, however, would prefer to protect its corporate ancien regime. Europe is afraid to change.

The European Union has also ruled against legislation that would deregulate its energy sector, force governments out of newly privatized companies, integrate financial service sectors and protect private patents. In each case, governments teamed up with large public and industrial unions to defeat pro-shareholder and pro-consumer
reform measures.

In Europe, it is consumers who are being denied the benefit of product choices and more efficient service delivery that comes from market-driven competition. The consumer is king in the United States, where President Bush's newly appointed antitrust chief Charles James criticized the EU decision on GE-Honeywell by saying the merger "would have been pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers. . . . Our conclusion was based on findings, confirmed by customers worldwide, that the combined firm could offer better products and services at more attractive prices than either firm could offer individually. That, in our view, is the essence of competition."

For many years, European economic growth has lagged well behind U.S. performance. A recent Euro think tank calculated that productivity in the EU nations hasn't increased in six years, contrasting that with the high-tech productivity miracle taking hold in the United States. Why? Because Europe is afraid of free-market competition and the transforming power of new ideas.

Perhaps nothing symbolizes European hostility to innovation, entrepreneurship and private investment returns than the steady decline of its new currency. Offered initially at nearly $1.20, the Euro has fallen to 85 cents, a roughly 30 percent depreciation in only 18 months. All too reminiscent of failed Latin currencies, the Euro is fast becoming the Euro-peso.

Because of its deep-rooted commitment to national (and now EU supra-national) planning, Europe has failed to rid itself of top-heavy government regulations, be it overtaxation, excess social spending, rigid labor laws, hyperactive environmentalism, nationalized health care or sheltering its most powerful businesses from global competition.

Repeated attacks by EU commissioners on Irish and German tax cuts are one example. Opposition to Wal-Mart price cuts in Germany is another. Trade restrictions remain in effect. It's still far too expensive to hire or fire European workers.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill recently blasted the EU rejection of the GE-Honeywell deal, calling its regulatory process "flawed" and unfairly "reaching into the affairs of other countries." Democratic U.S. Sens. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Fritz Hollings of South Carolina harshly criticized the action.

But a retaliatory trade war that would almost surely cause yet another sinking spell for world stock markets and the recession-prone global economy is not the answer. Instead, President Bush should play a leadership role by using his bully pulpit to defend U.S. businesses and extol the economic benefits of market-oriented competition, tax cuts, deregulation and free trade.

At the upcoming G-8 economic conference, Mr. Bush can sell the virtues of the American system of free-market entrepreneurial capitalism, a system with a proven record of prosperity. If, however, Europe remains intransigent, then it will continue to suffer from capital flight and a brain drain, as its best and brightest will seek the safe harbor of economic freedom in the United States.

Honeywell  resets on core business.

STRATEGY GRAHAM WARWICK / washington dc
After  GE merger block, non-performing units face sale and  EC seeks to mend fences with US  competition
authorities

Honeywell is expected to restructure around its core aerospace business as it attempts to continue as an independent company in the wake of European rejection of its planned merger with GeneralElectric.

Honeywell chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore resigned after the European Commission's 3 July decision to bar the $41 billion merger on the grounds it would have severely reduced competition in aerospace. He has been replaced by Larry Bossidy, who engineered the $12 billion merger of AlliedSignal and Honeywell in
1999, then stepped down in favour of Bonsignore.

Bossidy, who has become chairman and chief executive under a one-year contract, says his goal is to get Honeywell back on its feet and keep it independent, but adds that his mandate from the board is to "fix the company or sell it". He is expected to sell Honeywell's non-performing businesses, including several automotive units.

The EC blocked the merger after concluding it "would create or strengthen dominant positions in several markets and that the remedies proposed byGE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns".

The Commission found the merger would have created dominant positions in avionics, systems and business jet engines and strengthened GE's dominant positions in engines for large commercial aircraft and regional jets.

"The dominance would have been created or strengthened as a result of horizontal overlaps in some markets as well as through the extension of GE financial power and vertical integration to Honeywell activities," the EC said in a statement. The financial strength of leasing arm GECapital AviationServices was of particular concern to the
EC.

"We strongly disagree with the Commission's conclusions about the competitive effects of GE's acquisition of Honeywell and its statements about the market position and influence of GEAircraftEngines and GECapital AviationServices. The facts just don't support those assertions," said GE.

Announcing Bonsignore's resignation and Bossidy's return, Honeywell said it would take a $575-625 million charge against second-quarter earnings to cover merger-related expenses and other costs. The company is now forecasting full-year revenues of $24-24.5 billion.

Honeywell has been performing poorly since merging with AlliedSignal, and has been distracted from tackling lingering integration issues since GE made its take-over offer last October. Insiders say Bossidy will move quickly to implement business changes identified by GE. Honeywell had already cut its workforce and costs in
anticipation of the merger.

ECcompetition commissioner Mario Monti, meanwhile, rejected criticism that the EC listened too closely to GE's competitors, principally Rolls-Royce and United Technologies, in deciding to block the merger. "European merger control is not about protecting competitors but about ensuring that markets remain sufficiently competitive in the long run," the EC said.

Monti also played down the significance of the different conclusions reached by European and US competition authorities, the USDepartment of Justice having approved the merger with minor divestitures. Describing GE/Honeywell as a "rare case" where transatlantic authorities interpret the facts and forecast the effects differently, Monti says he intends to strengthen bilateral co-operation to reduce the risk of disagreement.

Big American  Merger Plans Fail to Get as Far as the Altar
Lauren Chambliss

10 July 2001
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Evening Standard - London

A tougher  regulatory and economic environment in the US is taking a toll on corporate marriages. Not only are fewer acquisitions being proposed but a larger percentage of suitors are baling out at the last minute. So far this year, 176 merger deals in America have been withdrawn, a rate that is about a third higher than this time last year.

The reasons vary. General Electric  would be happy to walk down the aisle with  Honeywell  if the European Union's competition regulators would let it. Tyson Food got a severe case of "buyer's regret" and tried to back out of a $3.2 billion (UKpound 2.3 billion) marriage with meatpacker IBP until a Delaware court forced it to the altar. Consolidated Edison and Northeast Utilities are battling in court over which partner is responsible for wrecking their planned $3.8 billion  merger.

Compaq Computer and food products company HJ Heinz attempted to make acquisitions to expand their businesses but were topped by higher bids from elsewhere. In the mergers and acquisitions heyday at the end of the last decade, a rival offer would usually ignite a bidding war but in today's harsh economic climate suitors are more likely to walk than add to the dowry, analysts say. Corporate buyers are less willing to take a risk and increase the cost of the transaction.

"There has been a big pick-up in the number of deals falling through," says Richard Peterson, merger tracker for Thomson Financial. "There are a variety of reasons that generally boil down to an inhospitable economic environment coupled with increased regulatory scrutiny."

Officials said that United Airlines grounded its $60-a-share offer for US Airways because Washington anti-trust regulators were demanding too many concessions on the deal, which would have combined two of America's largest carriers and squeezed competition.

Analysts say the rapidly sinking economic environment probably also had a lot to do with it. United lost $300 million in the first quarter, squeezed by rising energy and labour costs and sluggish travel demand. It is not in the best position to absorb a troubled rival with a history of labour strife.

When United first announced the deal more than a year ago, both it and the industry were in much better shape. This week, United's share price had its biggest gain in months as investors expressed relief the merger was aborted.

Being rejected can be devastating for the company left standing at the altar. US Airways' shares plunged 30 percent last week to a 52-week low after United called off the marriage, citing anti-trust concerns.

US Airways has had a long, troubled history with combinations. The East Coast carrier was partially owned by British Airways in the Nineties and that combination didn't work out as planned. BA was lucky to get out when it did, analysts believe.

United's hesitation comes at a time when merger activity has slowed sharply from its earlier record pace. Announced mergers and acquisitions activity is off 55 percent from a year ago. The number of deals at the mid-year point is $382 billion, down from $878 billion during the first six months of last year, according to Thomson Financial.

It isn't just American firms that are getting cold feet, however. Foreign acquisitions of US companies are also well off the pace they were at last year. Foreigners have announced plans to buy $74.6 billion worth of corporate America so far in 2001, about half of the $145.4 billion at this time last year.

Honeywell  International Inc. announced a proposed restructuring of its  merger with GE in a bid to satisfy divestiture concerns by  regulators in Europe that have threatened to kill the deal. Honeywell  is offering to lower the exchange ratio of the deal from 1.055 shares of  GE for every Honeywell  share to 1.01 shares of  GE for every Honeywell  share. Honeywell  requested that  GE make a private placement of 19.9% of the common equity of GECAS. The lower price for the  merger would compensate GE for any loss of value as a result of the divestiture.

The Wall Street Journal is reporting that  European antitrust enforcers have recommended formally blocking GE's bid to acquire Honeywell  International Inc., moving closer to officially ending the companies' embattled quest for regulatory approval.  According to the Journal, the European Commission's Merger Task Force deemed insufficient GE's latest proposals to win antitrust approval  and confirmed that the proposed acquisition will not be allowed to go through in its current form. If the two sides are unable to bridge their differences, the Merger Task Force's draft decision would proceed to the  European Commission's College of  Commissioners for final  approval.

A monopoly broth with a variety of ingredients - City Law.
By Edward Fennell.
615 words

The Times

Brussels sent an important message when it ruled against  GE's merger with Honeywell  but nobody knows what it is, says Edward Fennell
The European Commission's decision to block the  merger of GE and Honeywell  was a dog's dinner of a ruling.
Antitrust and M&A lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic are now left trying to assess its significance.

In a year in which, according to the latest figures, M&A activity has collapsed by between 40 per cent and 50 per cent on the same period last year the merger would have given a huge boost to the system. The reasons why it is not going ahead are attributed variously to naive European economic theory, arrogant American executives, overweening Commission officials and a European resolve not to be taken for granted.
The controversy surrounding the deal means that emotions are bound to run high. The rumour mill in Brussels
last week alleged that lawyers at Clifford Chance, acting for GE, were "disgusted" by the outcome although some
observers had regarded the decision as a foregone conclusion given the political "body language" of Commission
officials in the countdown to the final announcement.

Yet aside from the recriminations lawyers are anxious to learn lessons from the decision. Brussels, it seems, is trying to send an important message. Deciphering it, however, is taxing some of the best minds in the City. Although the basic position is clear enough - protecting consumers comes first in the US while forestalling market dominance through competition is the priority for Europe - the interpretation has become a conundrum.

For example, Nigel Parr, of Ashurst Morris Crisp, was left puzzling over just what standard the Commission will be looking for. "The Commission's statement was unclear in places," he said. "It referred to a number of different issues and it was not evident what the respective weights given to each of them were. It was a kind of monopoly broth in which there was a variety of ingredients. Of course, every deal is different but what we need is a benchmark we can use to evaluate at what point a proposed merger would come into conflict with what the Commission wants."
Some commentators say the real cause of the confusion is that an economic question - about market dominance
- is being addressed by European lawyers who lack an adequate technical background. The outcome, say cynics
(especially in America), is DIYE, Do it Yourself Economics, with a botch-up as a result. But there are other
ingredients.

Andrew Renshaw, of Freshfield Bruckhaus Deringer (which advised third party complainants in the UK and US), considers that the deal fell victim to an American assumption that competition issues in Europe were simply a matter of bureaucratic "form-filling".
Conor Maguire, head of the EU and competition law practice in Brussels for Simmons & Simmons, agreed that
the troublesome elements of the deal should have been identified and dealt with much earlier. But he also thought
that the decisions would have no significant impact on the M&A market. If there were compelling business
reasons for a merger then it would continue and if divestments were necessary to satisfy Brussels then they
would be made - at least until the point when the reasons no longer made sense.

In fact, last week's decision may have done antitrust lawyers some good. Alec Burnside, of Linklaters, said that almost immediately clients were asking him to look in detail at their acquisition plans. So maybe GE-Honeywell will boost M&A and antitrust practices after all.

GE: Welch sets retirement date as company  reports  15 percent increase in earnings

By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN AP Business Writer

STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -  General Electric  Co.'s legendary chairman John F. Welch announced he would retire at the Sept. 7 board meeting, saying strong quarterly results reported Thursday left him confident about  GE's future.
Welch, 65, planned to retire in April but deferred his departure to shepherd the $41 billion  merger of
Fairfield-based GE and Honeywell  International Inc. That deal was derailed earlier this month by objections from
European Union antitrust regulators.

Welch's hands-on leadership is credited with shaping GE into an international conglomerate ranging from jet engines to medical equipment to the NBC television network. His pronouncements are watched by Wall Street and his management style held up as a model.
His successor, president and chairman-elect Jeffrey R. Immelt, was announced last November.

In announcing second-quarter earnings of $3.9 billion - a 15 percent increase that met analysts' expectations - Welch said he is leaving "more confident than ever that Jeff Immelt and his team will lead the company to greater achievements in the future."
GE did not cite the cost of the merger attempt, but analyst John Inch estimated the deal cost GE $50 million to
$60 million in the second quarter. Analysts said they were impressed with the results, given the weak economy
and the failed merger.
"I think particularly given the economy this was an exceptionally strong quarter," said Inch, with Bear Stearns in
New York.
GE will likely draw more interest as a company that can weather tough times, analysts said.

"We think there is substantial pent up demand for GE stock now that the uncertainty of Honeywell has been removed," said Jeanne Terrile, first vice president of Merrill Lynch in New York.
Shares of GE rose $1.73 or 3.88 percent to $46.34 in trading Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock
Exchange.

GE, which has forecast double-digit earnings growth for the year, said its second-quarter profits were helped by strong performances in its financial services and power systems divisions. But businesses more affected by the economy, such as appliances, showed weaker earnings.

For the three months ended June 30, net income totaled 39 cents per share, compared with $3.38 billion, or 34 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.

Revenue for the quarter was $31.98 billion, down 3 percent from $32.86 billion in the second quarter last year. GE said revenue was down because the company exited some businesses while others were downsized.

GE Capital Services' second-quarter profits rose 16 percent, to $1.5 billion, with strength showing in consumer services and equipment management, GE said.


Page 51 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Power systems reported profits of $1.22 billion, up 63 percent from $752 million. GE said the unit had $5.3 billion in orders, with shipments of heavy-duty gas turbines up 55 percent to 90 units.

The aircraft engines segment had $667 million in profits, up 10 percent from $609 million. Earnings in the plastics division were down 15 percent, while technical products and services, which includes medical items, saw a 24 percent increase in earnings.

At NBC, profits were $541 million, down 15 percent from $635 million. GE cited a difficult advertising environment for the decline, but noted audience share improvements in the May "sweeps" period, used to calculate advertising rates.

For the six months ended June 30, GE earned $6.47 billion, or 64 cents per share, on revenue of $62.48 billion. In the year-ago period, GE earned $5.97 billion, or 59 cents per share, on revenue of $62.86 billion.
Welch has some 40 years of service with GE, including 20 as chairman. He stage-managed the selection of
Immelt, and said in March it was his intention to "get out of the way" of his successor.

Welch, who has received a gigantic $7.1 million advance to write a book about business management, has said he does not intend to run another company, but would consider a non-executive chairmanship or a position mentoring other executives.

Although Welch had hoped to cap his career with the Honeywell merger, most observers say he will be remembered more for his successes than the failure to anticipate European competition concerns.
At about $440 billion, GE is the world's largest company in terms of market value.

"I think history is just going to remember Jack Welch was one of the greatest industrial managers of our time," Inch said last week. "Every conglomerate in America wants to grow up to be GE."
Shares of GE were up $2.39 cents to close at $47 in trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -  General Electric  Co. chairman Jack Welch said Thursday he will officially retire at the company's Sept. 7 board meeting.

Welch, 65, had planned to retire in April but deferred his departure to shepherd the $41 billion merger of GE and Honeywell  International Inc. That deal was derailed earlier this month by objections from European Union antitrust regulators.
His successor, president and chairman-elect Jeffrey R. Immelt, was announced last November.

In a news release Thursday announcing second-quarter earnings of $3.9 billion - meeting analysts' expectations - Welch said he would be stepping down on the Friday after Labor Day. He said he is leaving "more confident than ever that Jeff Immelt and his team will lead the company to greater achievements in the future."

John F. Welch's hands-on leadership is credited with shaping GE into an international conglomerate ranging from jet engines to medical equipment to the NBC television network. His pronouncements are watched by Wall Street and his management style held up as a model.
Welch has some 40 years of service with GE, including 20 as chairman. He stage-managed the selection of
Immelt, and said in March it was his intention to "get out of the way" of his successor.

Welch, who has received a gigantic $7.1 million advance to write a book about business management, has said he does not intend to run another company, but would consider a non-executive chairmanship or a position mentoring other executives.

FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -  General Electric  Co. chairman Jack Welch said Thursday he will officially retire at the company's Sept. 7 board meeting.

Welch, 65, had planned to retire in April but deferred his departure to shepherd the $41 billion merger of GE and Honeywell  International Inc. That deal was derailed earlier this month by objections from European Union antitrust regulators.

His successor, president and chairman-elect Jeffrey R. Immelt, was announced last November. Immelt was president and chief executive officer of GE Medical Systems in Waukesha, Wis.

In a news release Thursday announcing second-quarter earnings of $3.9 billion - meeting analysts' expectations - Welch said he would be stepping down on the Friday after Labor Day. He said he is leaving "more confident than ever that Jeff Immelt and his team will lead the company to greater achievements in the future."

John F. Welch's hands-on leadership is credited with taking GE from a light bulb company to an international empire ranging from jet engines to medical equipment to the NBC television network. At about $440 billion, GE is the world's largest company in terms of market value.
His pronouncements are watched by Wall Street and his management style held up as a model.

Brave new world of Buster Kartelski... - Mario Monti's.....

12 July 2001
European Voice
EVOICE

Brave new world of Buster Kartelski... - Mario Monti's decision to block the  GE-Honeywell merger highlighted major differences in the  EU and US approaches to competition control. Peter Chapman asks whether the world
is ready for an international anti-trust body PICTURE the scene. It's the year 2010. The global economy is slowing down again, pressure is on companies to cut costs, trim back their workforces...and consolidate.
Mega Giant Corp., the biggest US widget maker, has decided now is the time to launch a friendly take-over bid for
Littlegian
t Inc, the world's largest manufacturer of gizmos.
Analysts express universal acclaim for the deal's commercial sense.
But European competition chief Buster Kartelski, Poland's first Commissioner, is sceptical about the way Mega
Giant could bundle together packages of widgets and gizmos - to the detriment of competition.

He's at odds with US assistant attorney-general Max Profit, who thinks the merger promises compelling benefits to consumers.
If the deal were happening right now, in the aftermath of

the GE-Honeywell fiasco, the early warning sirens would be signalling the trade world's equivalent of nuclear warfare. But this is a brave new world of cooperation in competition and merger control.
Instead of ripping each other to pieces, the deal goes to an independent arbitrator - the World Trade Organisation
- for final adjudication.
Kartelski is overruled by an appeals panel which says 'no problem' and the deal goes through. Mega Giant's
CEO Jack French comes over for an amiable cup of tea with th
e EU anti-trust buster to discuss undertakings the WTO has imposed.

Is this a glimpse of the near future? Fat chance, say competition lawyers, such as Frank Fine, an American partner with the Brussels practice of UK law firm DLA. "A global romper room where all anti-trust laws are the same? I don't think it's very realistic any time during my career."

Such comments do not deter real-life Competition Commissioner Mario Monti from having a go. In the same week as he vetoed the all-American GE-Honeywell deal
, he was in Geneva telling the

United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) that competition should be on the agenda for November's WTO ministerial meeting in Qatar. US officials met with Commission experts on the fringes of last week's UNCTAD event - and Washington sources say the White House is still weighing up
Monti's arguments. But what can we expect if his publicity campaign pays off and competition makes it onto the
Qatar agenda? Not a lot, says Philip Marsden, a Canadian barrister

specialising in trade and competition issues with Linklaters and Alliance. "If there is agreement it would be very banal. It would be an agreement to continue talking - not an agreement that you could sue on." So why would it be so difficult to thrash out a workable solution giving the WTO ultimate power to rule on anti-trust? For starters,
Page 57 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
says Marsden, take the EU and US. The world's two biggest trade blocs actually already operate the "most sophisticated system of competition cooperation on earth" - the

'positive comity agreement', which allows each jurisdiction to flag concerns about the local impact of competition cases to its counterparts across the Atlantic. That the sides totally disagreed on a case such as GE-Honeywell shows how tough it would be to improve bilateral cooperation - let alone set up something on a global level.

And then, says Marsden, you should look at what work has actually taken place at the various world bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OE

CD) or UNCTAD - not to mention the WTO - where competition has been discussed for years but very little consensus has been reached. "Any self-respecting competition authorities would say stop price-fixing, but they can't agree on pretty much anything else. There is an OECD agreement saying we should prohibit hardcore cartels, but even there, there are different standards," he says. "In the US you can end up in jail, in the EU you don't. The Canadians have much higher thresholds [for taking punitive action].
And that is something that practically everyone agrees on."

That doesn't mean efforts to boost cooperation are a waste of time. On the contrary, Marsden believes they could help foster greater coherence in competition issues across the globe. But he says the choice of forum for the talks in the short term is an important one, and it would not be the WTO or the myriad of other institutions from the
Paris-based OECD to UNCTAD. "There is a joke that UNCTAD stands for 'under no circumstances take a decision'.

" On the other hand, he says the WTO suffers because it is a "serious forum - not a talking shop". "It is like a new international order. Because of that I don't think it is good for global competition rules because there is not enough agreement on laws."

The best idea, he says, would be to host future talks at the as-yet-unborn global competition forum manned exclusively by national competition experts and their advisors. "In terms of increasing cooperation all you need is a global competition forum. It c

ould get competition officials in the same room and say, when a GE-Honeywell comes up 'what are we going to do with it?'"

First touted by former US anti-trust chief Joel Klein and now supported vocally by Monti, the aim of the forum is to bring together competition experts from across the world to swap ideas, information, and names and addresses. Most importantly it could foster mutual trust among experts who may have never met before they found themselves examining the same deal from desks separated by

an ocean. "Right then, even without a WTO agreement, when a delicate case happens, you would trust them. Before you would not," says Marsden. In the long run "and we are talking ages", the forum might, just, be able to pass on the baton to the WTO.

But don't hold your breath. Marsden still fears it is a "pipe dream" that everyone would agree to a set of legally watertight WTO-level rules, allowing firms and governments to appeal foreign competition rulings. So, if the drive for cooperation is not the panac

ea, is there a solution that would guarantee firms and their lawyers a decent night's sleep when they plan a big deal? Not really, claims DLA's Frank Fine. He says firms should face up to the fact that there are differences in the way jurisdictions handle cases. It's left to them to weigh up the risks and decide whether to proceed. GE and its lawyers must have known its case was politically sensitive, in Europe at least.
They chose to carry on regardless, knowing the deal had little chance of going throug

h unchallenged. "The real story here is not this multilateral cooperation nonsense," says Fine. "The way to avoid outcomes like this is getting straight that the EU is sovereign, has power and will use it. American companies can't expect to ride rough hod over European law."

EU'S MONTI DEFENDS BIG MERGER THUMBS-DOWN.
By STEWART FLEMING.
747 words
13 July 2001
The Evening Standard
NS
English
(c) 2001
Off the wall" was the insult US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill hurled across the Atlantic to describe the European Union's decision to turn down the proposed $42 billion (#30 billion)  merger of General Electric  and Honeywell.  It was a remark that demonstrated once again how O'Neill is struggling to escape from his past as chief executive of Alcoa, a provincial US multinational, and find a tone appropriate to the great office of state he occupies.

The man who was the butt of America's frustration with the decision,  EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, chose the splendour of Merchant Taylor's Hall in the City's Threadneedle Street to give Washington the measured res-ponse that could be expected from a former professor of economics who, in the mid-1990s, came close to being chosen as Italy's Prime Minister.

Monti's decision to defend and explain the GE-Honeywell decision reflected in part his fear that some of the mud being hurled at him by frustrated US politicians and businessmen would stick. This could weaken the EU's capacity to play an active role in regulating mergers and competition in a globalising world.

O'Neill's whinge that the EU was acting extra-territor-ially, a complaint that used to be heard most frequently from this side of the Atlantic, could not be left to fester. It is not just that the Commission is in the midst of examining several other high-profile competition issues involving US companies, including allegedly anti-competitive behaviour by Microsoft.
As businesses operate increasingly on a global scale and cross-border mergers become more frequent, Monti
has to defend the legitimacy of the EU's anti-trust regime or, in effect, risk slowly conceding the dominant position
in global anti-trust regulation to Washing-ton's Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission.

Speaking before an invited audience of some of the most powerful businessmen and bankers in Europe, ranging from Chris Gent of Vodafone to Jean-Pierre Halbron of Alcatel, Monti said the GE-Honeywell case "raised three key questions. Is it true that, in applying merger control, the Commission cares more about competitors than customers? Is there effective judicial control of merger decisions by the Commission? Could the outcome of this important case affect co-operation between anti-trust agencies on both sides of the Atlantic?"
Rejecting US charges that European policy pays too much attention to grumbles from competitors, Monti insisted
- citing among other examples the EU decision to block the Volvo-Scania merger - that the impact of a deal on
customers is no less central to EU anti-trust policy than to American.

"In the GE-Honeywell case, not only competitors but also customers from both sides of the Atlantic complained," he added.
As for judicial oversight, he pointed out that since 1990 the Commission has only prohibited 15 mergers, less than
1% of its caseload, and only two of its judgments have been overturned in court.

On EU-US relations, he pointed out that the EU, like the US, is "fully entitled to review mergers between non-EU companies" which are likely to have an appreciable impact in the EU. He added that there is "no indication whatsoever of any discriminatory treatment" ag-ainst US companies.

The overwhelming majority of the 394 mergers involving a US company that the Commission has looked at have been cleared, he said before expressing optimism that GE-Honeywell would be seen as an exceptional "divergence" of judgment between anti-trust authorities that had been co-operating closely and effectively for several years.

Page 64 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Whether or not this optimism is justified depends on how Washington responds. If, as many suspect, GE's politically well-connected boss Jack Welch adopted the well-tested ploy of launching his bid for Honeywell at a time when Washington's anti-trust authorities were distracted by last year's Presidential election and that therefore the proposed deal did not get proper scrutiny in the US, perhaps ruptured relations can be restored.

But, as Josef Ackermann, the man nominated to become chief executive of Deutsche Bank next year, remarked: "The Commissioner's decision last week in the GE-Honeywell case illustrated that Europe is a powerful voice on the world stage."

This is something Washington, and O'Neill, are finding it hard to come to terms with and that does not bode well for future relations.

WELCH DEPARTING EARLY AFTER HONEYWELL FAILURE

With the derailment of the $41 billion  merger that was to have capped his distinguished career,  General Electric
chairman Jack Welch said yesterday he would step down Sept. 7.

Welch, 65, was supposed to have retired in April but stayed on to guide the planned union of GE and industrial conglomerate Honeywell.  But the deal was vetoed last week by  European anti-trust regulators, and Welch had to settle for news of record quarterly profits as the high note to end his 20-year reign.

GE said profits for the latest quarter rose 15% to $3.9 billion as its manufacturing businesses remained strong despite the slowing economy, which has hurt the company's appliance sales and NBC.

The results, which marked the company's highest quarterly profits ever, met Wall Street's expectations of 39 cents a share, compared with $3.38 billion, or 34 cents, in the same quarter last year.

Yesterday, its shares jumped $2.39, or 5% to $47. During his 20- year reign, GE's share price has multiplied more than 38-fold.

Welch said the results persuaded him the company's future was secure, adding he is "more confident than ever that Jeff Immelt and his team will lead the company to greater achievements in the future."
Immelt was named to succeed Welch last November.

Welch, whose missteps in the failed GE-Honeywell deal, many say, have haunted his last days in office, will still be remembered as one of corporate America's most admired executives.

Still, Welch is unlikely to leave the public eye. He is planning a consulting career, and has sold the rights to his memoir for than $7 million.

With the derailment of the $41 billion  merger that was to have capped his distinguished career,  General Electric

Welch, 65, was supposed to have retired in April but stayed on to guide the planned union of GE and industrial conglomerate Honeywell.

EU Demonstrates New Power through Rejection  of GE-Honeywell Merger

KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Evening Standard - London

"Off the wall" was the insult US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill hurled across the Atlantic to describe the European Union's decision to turn down the proposed $42 billion (UKpound 30 billion)  merger of General          Electric and Honeywell.  It was a remark that demonstrated once again how O'Neill is struggling to escape from his past as chief executive of Alcoa, a provincial US multinational, and find a tone appropriate to the great office
of state he occupies.

The man who was the butt of America's frustration with the decision,  EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, chose the splendour of Merchant Taylor's Hall in the City's Threadneedle Street to give Washington the measured response that could be expected from a former professor of economics who, in the mid-1990s, came close to being chosen as Italy's Prime Minister.

Monti's decision to defend and explain the GE-Honeywell decision reflected in part his fear that some of the mud being hurled at him by frustrated US politicians and businessmen would stick. This could weaken the EU's capacity to play an active role in regulating mergers and competition in a globalising world.

O'Neill's whinge that the EU was acting extra-territorially, a complaint that used to be heard most frequently from this side of the Atlantic, could not be left to fester. It is not just that the Commission is in the midst of examining several other high-profile competition issues involving US companies, including allegedly anti-competitive behaviour by Microsoft.
As businesses operate increasingly on a global scale and cross-border mergers become more frequent, Monti
has to defend the legitimacy of the EU's anti-trust regime or, in effect, risk slowly conceding the dominant position
in global anti-trust regulation to Washing- ton's Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission.

Speaking before an invited audience of some of the most powerful businessmen and bankers in Europe, ranging from Chris Gent of Vodafone to Jean-Pierre Halbron of Alcatel, Monti said the GE-Honeywell case "raised three key questions. Is it true that, in applying merger control, the Commission cares more about competitors than customers? Is there effective judicial control of merger decisions by the Commission? Could the outcome of this important case affect co-operation between anti-trust agencies on both sides of the Atlantic?"
Rejecting US charges that European policy pays too much attention to grumbles from competitors, Monti insisted
-- citing among other examples the EU decision to block the Volvo-Scania merger -- that the impact of a deal on
customers is no less central to EU anti-trust policy than to American.

"In the GE-Honeywell case, not only competitors but also customers from both sides of the Atlantic complained," he added.
As for judicial oversight, he pointed out that since 1990 the Commission has only prohibited 15 mergers, less than
1 percent of its caseload, and only two of its judgments have been overturned in court.

On EU-US relations, he pointed out that the EU, like the US, is "fully entitled to review mergers between non-EU companies" which are likely to have an appreciable impact in the EU. He added that there is "no indication whatsoever of any discriminatory treatment" against US companies.

The overwhelming majority of the 394 mergers involving a US company that the Commission has looked at have been cleared, he said before expressing optimism that GE-Honeywell would be seen as an exceptional "divergence" of judgment between anti-trust authorities that had been co-operating closely and effectively for several years.

Whether or not this optimism is justified depends on how Washington responds. If, as many suspect, GE's politically well-connected boss Jack Welch adopted the well-tested ploy of launching his bid for Honeywell at a

time when Washington's anti-trust authorities were distracted by last year's Presidential election and that therefore the proposed deal did not get proper scrutiny in the US, perhaps ruptured relations can be restored.

But, as Josef Ackermann, the man nominated to become chief executive of Deutsche Bank next year, remarked: "The Commissioner's decision last week in the GE-Honeywell case illustrated that Europe is a powerful voice on the world stage."

This is something Washington, and O'Neill, are finding it hard to come to terms with and that does not bode well for future relations.

MARIO MONTI received a rare round of applause from Britain's Eurosceptic Press following his decision to raid the offices of mobile phone companies in Britain and Germany as part of a probe into the high prices they are charging for cross-border calls.

For Monti, 58, the positive public response will have been welcome and expected. With signs of "reform fatigue" setting in across the EU, he is using the the powers he has to try to keep the pressure on governments and businesses to make the European economy more consumer-friendly as well as more efficient.

Those powers are immense. Indeed, the competition directorate he heads is often criticised for being not only the investigator of competition policy abuses but also being judge, jury and executioner rolled into one -- it can decide whether laws have been broken, demand remedies and impose fines. Monti's response is that he and his staff
can be required to justify their decisions before the courts.

His reforming agenda is broad. To make Brussels appear more relevant to ordinary EU citizens, car prices as well as telephone charges are being scrutinised. He is also looking into Europe's financial markets.

Earlier this year, he turned down the job of Italy's foreign minister. As his reputation grows, however, many predict that even the top job in Italian politics could still lie ahead.

Welch to retire from GE on Sept. 7; With Honeywell  deal gone bust, he'll turn over the reins to Immelt

General Electric  Co. chairman Jack Welch said Thursday he will officially retire at the company's Sept. 7 board meeting.

Welch, 65, had planned to retire in April but deferred his departure to shepherd the $41 billion merger of GE and Honeywell  International Inc. That deal was derailed this month by objections from  European Union antitrust regulators.
His successor, president and chairman-elect Jeffrey R. Immelt, the former head of Waukesha-based GE Medical
Systems, was announced last November.
In a news release Thursday announcing second-quarter earnings of $3.9 billion meeting analysts' expectations
Welch said he would be stepping down on the Friday after Labor Day.

He said he is leaving "more confident than ever that Jeff Immelt and his team will lead the company to greater achievements in the future."

John F. Welch's hands-on leadership is credited with shaping GE into an international conglomerate ranging from jet engines to medical equipment to the NBC television network.
His pronouncements are watched by Wall Street and his management style held up as a model.
Welch has some 40 years of service with GE, including 20 as chairman. He stage-managed the selection of
Immelt and said in March it was his intention to "get out of the way" of his successor.

Welch, who has received a gigantic $7.1 million advance to write a book about business management, has said he does not intend to run another company but would consider a non-executive chairmanship or a position mentoring other executives.

He said he envisioned an informal, personal and private relationship with a handful of executives rather than a broad consulting role and wanted to work with managers on real projects rather than hypothetical situations.

Although Welch had hoped to cap his career with the Honeywell merger, most observers say he will be remembered more for his successes than the failure to anticipate European competition concerns.
At about $440 billion, GE is the world's largest company in terms of market value.

"I think history is just going to remember Jack Welch was one of the greatest industrial managers of our time," said John Inch, an analyst with Bear Stearns.
"Every conglomerate in America wants to grow up to be GE."
Shares of GE were up $2.39 to close at $47 in trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. Document MLWK000020100320dx7d02hpk

Welch to retire as head of world's most valuable company

Stamford; Conn. -- Welch, 65, planned to retire in April but deferred his departure to shepherd the $41-billion US merger of Fairfield, Conn.-based GE and Honeywell  International Inc. That deal was derailed earlier this month by objections from  European Union antitrust regulators.

Welch's hands-on leadership is credited with helping successfully oversee  GE's diverse operations, which range from jet engines to medical equipment to the NBC television network. At about $450 billion US,  GE is the world's largest company in stock market value.

Welch, who has received a gigantic $7.1-million advance to write a book about business management, has said he does not intend to run another company, but would consider a non- executive chairmanship.
His successor, president and chairman-elect Jeffrey Immelt, was announced last November.
In reporting second-quarter profits of $3.9 billion, Welch said he is leaving "more confident than ever that Jeff
Immelt and his team will lead the company to greater achievements in the future."

GE did not reveal how much it spent to undertake the Honeywell deal, but analyst John Inch estimated the deal cost the company as much as $60 million US in the second quarter.
Analysts said they were impressed with GE's results.
"Particularly given the economy, this was an exceptionally strong quarter," said Inch, with Bear Stearns in New
York.
GE shares rose $2.55 or five per cent, to close at $47.05 in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. GE, which has forecast double-digit earnings growth for the year, said its second-quarter profits were helped by
strong performances in its financial services and power systems divisions. But other businesses more affected by
the economy, such as appliances, showed weaker earnings.

For the three months ended June 30, net profits totalled 39 cents a share, compared with $3.38 billion, or 34 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.

EU Blocks  $40 Billion GE-Honeywell Merger

[GE]: Bell Helicopter Textron's [TXT]:
English

WASHINGTON--The European Union (EU) on July 3 as expected formally blocked the potential $40 billion
merger between General Electric  [GE] and Honeywell  [HON].

"The merger between GE and Honeywell,  as it was notified, would have severely reduced  competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EuropeanCompetitionCommissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

Monti acknowledged that there were opportunities to resolve the competition dilemmas presented by the pending merger, but that an adequate solution could not be agreed upon.

"There were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed," he said. "I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns."

The two companies offered their merger for regulatory clearance in Europe on Feb. 5, and the EU's Commission commenced a detailed investigation into the matter on March 1. In the end, given the leading status in various markets of both GE and Honeywell, a merger of the two would create dominant positions in the "markets for the supply of avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines, as well as to the strengthening of GE's existing dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets," the Commission said.

The Commission cited the horizontal overlap in some markets, the broadening of GE's financial power and vertical integration to Honeywell endeavors and the combination of the companies' complementary products as means by which the merged companies could have restricted competition. GE formulated two sets of plans to revise the agreement in an attempt to meet the EU demands in June, but the Commission rejected both proposals.

Tuesday's decision marks the 15th occasion since September 1990 that the EC has prohibited a merger, but only the second time that such a decision has included American firms.

Also significant in the decision is the difference of opinion demonstrated by the Commission and the Department of Justice, which approved the deal May 3. Justice had directed the new company divest Honeywell's helicopter engine unit to avoid antitrust issues.

The New Laws of Nations
By Laura D. Tyson

14 July 2001
The New York Times
NYTF

(c) 2001 New York Times Company
BERKELEY, Calif. -- As economic interconnections increase among countries around the world, critics protest
that this globalization is eroding the ability of governments to protect the interests of their citizens against those of
multinational corporations. But the EuropeanCommission's recent blocking of the proposed  merger of two
American companies, General Electric  and Honeywell,  suggests otherwise. Since the merged company would
have operated on both sides of the Atlantic, the merger hinged on the consent of not just one but two sets of
regulators, each with its own legal tradition and its own interpretation of the public interest. And despite public
relations campaigns by both companies, attempts at personal persuasion by G.E.'s formidable outgoing chief
executive, Jack Welch, and the threat of retaliation by Congress, the  European antitrust authorities  rejected this
merger, which had easily won  approval  from the United States Justice Department.
In this case globalization strengthened rather than weakened government oversight of corporate activity.

But if this outcome calms the fears of those who worry about corporate titans dominating the globe, it is likely to intensify the anxieties of those who worry about globalization's weakening of national sovereignty. What right does the European Commission have telling two American companies what they can and cannot do, these people might ask, especially when its decision conflicts with the decision reached by the relevant American authority? Sure, we support the rule of law, but whose law? Aren't our antitrust laws, which reflect our strong market tradition, superior to Europe's, which tend to reflect a strong statist tradition?

Tension is growing between economic globalization and the laws and institutions within national borders. The Europeans understand such tensions well. Driven by growing economic interdependence and the desire to end centuries of armed conflict, they have spent much of the last half-century cutting back national autonomy in favor of shared laws and institutions, like the Common Market; the European Union; and a common currency, the euro. But for the United States, which is less dependent on foreign trade and investment and is accustomed to using its economic and military might to get its way, giving up some national autonomy to foster globalization remains a highly questionable -- and politically risky -- proposition.

The reality, though, is that countries have already broken the most easily removed barriers to international trade and investment by getting rid of tariffs and export subsidies. The remaining barriers are embedded in a variety of national policies and institutions that were long the domain of domestic decision makers. These barriers involve politically sensitive concerns like health and safety, corporate governance and philosophies about business practices. Antitrust regulation has traditionally been one of those areas governed by domestic laws and traditions.

Yet over the past decade, antitrust experts from the European Commission have had close and frequent contact with their counterparts at the American Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission. Consultations have ranged from simple exchanges of information to detailed discussions of the merits of particular merger proposals. This cooperation has fostered a convergence in approaches, despite differing laws. In hundreds of cases, European and American regulators have reached remarkably similar conclusions without any effort to harmonize their underlying rules and procedures. The G.E.-Honeywell case was a high-profile exception.

Backers of the American position on the G.E.-Honeywell proposal believe the merger would have benefited consumers by encouraging competition and reducing prices. Those who support the European position maintain that the merger would have created a dominant market player able to raise prices and discourage innovation by driving smaller competitors out of business. There are reasonable legal and economic arguments on both sides. This was not, as some critics have suggested, a politically motivated decision on the part of the Europeans, made to protect their domestic companies.

In announcing his rejection of the merger, Mario Monti, the soft-spoken academic who heads the body responsible for antitrust regulation for the European Commission, also renewed his call for a global forum at which antitrust experts from around the world can forge common approaches. And he reiterated his support for putting policies on business competition on the agenda for discussion in the next round of World Trade Organization talks, scheduled to begin this fall.

Like the Clinton administration, the Bush administration has expressed support for the global forum idea. But also like its predecessor, it opposes negotiating a W.T.O. agreement on competition policy, fearing the loss of national sovereignty to international rules. This opposition is shortsighted and ill-advised. It is only a matter of time before there will be so many companies with global reach that developing a common international set of antitrust principles becomes a necessity.

In this area as in many others, globalization will continue to chip away at the power of the nation state. As the Europeans know from their experience over the last 50 years, surrendering some degree of national autonomy is a natural and inevitable concomitant of growing economic interdependence.

POWERFUL TEST FOR MONTI IN EDF'S MONTEDISON MOVE MARIO.
By ANTHONY HILTON.

Monti, the European Union's Competition Commissioner, faces a second test of his toughness this week. Having had the nerve to face down the American government and block the proposed  merger between GE and Honeywell,  he now has to decide what, if anything, to do about the attempts by Electricite de France (EDF) to build up a stake in Italian electricity generator Montedison.

It is a classic tale of  European-style intrigue. EDF is a State-owned monopoly with access to cheap capital and immunity from takeover. It has been buying businesses overseas for years - including our London Electricity - but no one can do to it at home what it is doing to others abroad.

Successive governments have talked tough - Helen Liddell on the British side was notably vocal three years ago but nothing has happened. The French have resisted all efforts to open up their domestic utilities market and were still dragging their feet at the most recent summit in Gothenburg.

Partly because of this lack of reciprocity, or at least using it as a pretext, the then Italian government - the one before Silvio Berlusconi's - used a fairly dubious tactic to thwart the first run at Montedison earlier this year. It said no matter how many shares were bought by EDF, they would only have 2% of the voting rights.

The world has moved on since then. Italy got a new Prime Minister in media magnate Berlusconi, who rose to power at least in part with the backing of the Agnelli family of Fiat fame. Some Agnelli interests who appear to be acting with the support of EDF have renewed the assault on Montedison, so that it looks like an Italian bid rather than a French one.

So far the Italian government and Berlusconi-controlled media appear to be supporting this bid and there are inevitably dark but unproven allegations that Agnelli's price for supporting Berlusconi in the election was to get a clear run - which if successful would effectively deliver Montedison to the French.

Enter Mario Monti, a member of Berlusconi's party when not wearing his Brussels hat. He, as Competition Commissioner, is being pressed to intervene by the many who are fed up and frightened by the way EDF has opportunistically acquired a raft of businesses in a crescent across the Continent.

These say he would be perfectly justified in referring the bid to Brussels for further examination, and making it clear to the French that there can be no further cross-border expansion without genuine reciprocity and an opening up of the French market. The British should take a particular interest in this as Seeboard is said to be next on EDF's shopping list.

But will Monti do it? If he ducks the challenge he will be seen to be compromised and malleable. If he refers the bid he will alienate his friends in government and bring who knows what down on his head. He is caught by the backlash of the strength he showed the other day. It is one thing to say boo to the remote Americans - quite another to sabotage the games being played by one's most powerful friends and countrymen.

ONE has a certain sympathy with Marconi's Lord Simpson if he is indeed getting frustrated with the interventions of his predecessor Lord Weinstock.

As a shareholder, Weinstock has reason to be upset with the collapse of the Marconi share price, but if he did not like the strategy Simpson was following he should have said so at the time.

Challenging the prices Simpson was paying at the top of the market for those American telecom manufacturing businesses would have set off a useful debate. Complaining about them now with the benefit of hindsight is rather less useful.

Lesson Two: How to Call Off Your Own Antitrust Watchdog  --- Mario Monti Won Respect Showing  GE His
Teeth, Now Bared at Europe

BRUSSELS -- European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti has emerged from his rejection of General
Electric  Co.'s proposed merger with Honeywell  International Inc. as a stronger political figure at home.
He'll need all the strength he can muster.

Over the coming months, the 58-year-old Italian economist plans to target European mobile-phone companies, corporate tax breaks across the European Union, and government-affiliated industries in Germany, France and other nations. These closer-to-home targets have far more political clout with the European policy-makers who lobby Mr. Monti than distant U.S. firms.

"When the commission pursues national champions (from within the EU), the process can become extremely politicized," says Peter Alexiadis, a partner at the Brussels office of the U.S. law firm Squire Sanders & Dempsey. "It's inevitable that this sort of lobbying occurs at multiple levels, and it is hard to deal with."

Mr. Monti plunged ahead with his first major post-GE actions last week, and got a taste of the political reaction he's likely to engender.

On the same day that his staff conducted a series of raids on mobile-phone service providers suspected of colluding to set roaming tariffs, Mr. Monti launched a wide-ranging probe into the legality of corporate tax breaks in eight EU member states.

The competition chief argues that selective tax treatment can amount to unfair state subsidies to companies and can therefore distort fiscal competition in the EU. But many national governments value such tax breaks as a way of luring economic investment into their countries. Scrapping the system, they argue, could push companies to move their facilities outside the EU.

Didier Reynders, Belgium's finance minister, went on the radio to warn Mr. Monti of having "to take responsibility" for any fracas that could develop if he challenges these tax breaks.

Another simmering issue on Mr. Monti's agenda is Germany's controversial system of extending preferential loans and other perks to state-controlled regional banks. Private-sector banks have complained for years that this system amounts to unfair state subsidies.

Mr. Monti agrees in principle, and has asked the German government to reform the system. He's waiting for the Germans to come up with a proposal in September to overhaul the system but has warned them that the reforms must be far-reaching.

But over the years, German authorities have managed to delay these reforms. They argue that state-controlled banks carry out an important public service by financing small businesses and helping revive depressed industries. Today, German authorities and the commission are holding another meeting on the issue.

In France, Mr. Monti is also likely to face a politically difficult task in trying to curb the power of state-owned energy giant Electricite de France SA. Mr. Monti's people are examining a complaint by an EDF competitor alleging that EDF abuses its market power at home while aggressively expanding in other EU countries by buying up local firms.
Page 87 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
After the GE fight, some observers expected Mr. Monti to go slow and avoid picking fights with his European supporters. EU member states gave him unanimous political backing to halt the Honeywell acquisition despite sharp criticism from U.S. officials, including President Bush.

"I think there will be repercussions," says Nils Von Hinten-Reed, an antitrust expert at London Economics, a consulting firm in Brussels. "Some national authorities will say to him, `Don't push it too far out again.' "

But Mr. Monti has long demonstrated political independence despite heavy lobbying. In 1999, he blocked the merger between Swedish truck makers Volvo AB and Scania AB, ignoring a personal plea from Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson to approve the deal.

Before that, when he served as the Internal Market Commissioner, he successfully battled to scrap duty-free shopping for people traveling within the EU -- even though such perks were widely popular with consumers around Europe. He argued that these discounts were subsidized from the pockets of other taxpayers and were therefore unfair.

If anything, his current job encourages his maverick streak. Unlike most of his fellow European commissioners, he doesn't need to submit his recommendations for rigorous and legally binding scrutiny by EU national governments and the European Parliament. This makes it easier for Mr. Monti and his powerful staff to pursue initiatives
without worrying too much about their political fallout.

"Mr. Monti didn't waver on the issue (of GE) and he didn't give in to the political hype," says Frederic Jenny, vice chairman of Conseil de la Concurrance, the French antitrust authority.

Indeed, his arsenal of legal weapons has expanded. That's because he plowed novel legal ground by arguing that GE could unfairly dominate markets by bundling different products lines and services in a single discounted package. Mr. Monti could use this rationale to challenge other megamergers.
"You just don't know whether you are going to be in trouble with the commission or not," says Mr. Von
Hinten-Reed, the antitrust analyst.

On the Home Front
European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is turning his sights to antitrust issues within Europe:
Issue: Reform of state-financed banking in Germany
Obstacle: The German government sees the system as a crucial pillar for local economies
Issue: Corporate tax breaks across the EU
Obstacle: National governments defend them as a vehicle for promoting investment
Issue: The market power of national energy monopolies
Obstacle: Some governments' resistance to opening their energy markets

ANOTHER VIEW COMMENT
European Union sends U. S. signal by blocking big G. E. acquisition
JOHN J. KARAKASH Special to The Morning Call - Freelance
890 words
17 July 2001
Allentown Morning Call

(Copyright 2001)
The recently considered $43 billion acquisition of  Honeywell  by General Electric  was a high-profile global business venture. Cleared by U.S.  antitrust authorities, it was blocked by the competition division of the European Commission, which oversees mergers of companies doing business within the  European Union (EU). The commission has set an upper limit of $4.3 billion on the global sales of the two firms and of $215 million on their sales within the  EU. It offered to negotiate and  approve the merger if GE were to divest itself of some business assets, some of which are a market threat to its competitors here at home.  GE refused.

While in Europe, President Bush was made aware of ongoing negotiations. The administration called the  EU decision "off the wall" and autocratic. The Senate condemned  EU opposition to the  merger as a move "to protect and promote European industry."

It is a fact: From the shambles of a ruined continent more than half a century ago, the U.S. brought into being the EU, a democratic entity with a population and a GNP comparable to America's. We ought to be proud of this "most unsordid act in history," as Winston Churchill called it. But we now need to come to terms with reality: A continental power, the EU is developing its own political, security and trade policies. And they diverge from what Washington thought they would be.

Rejection of the GE-Honeywell merger is just another business footnote. Of far greater significance is the EU thinking that brought it about. Realizing that the economies of candidates for EU membership are very weak, the EU has leveled the playing field. Strictly speaking, antitrust laws aim to protect competition, not competitors. But when the combined GNP of four EU candidate states is less than 65 percent of what GE offered to aquire Honeywell, what chance do such states have to keep market predators from snapping up promising assets?

The U.S. antitrust policy seeks to benefit consumers. The EU, taking a longer view and thinking of the economies of eastern Europe, wants to promote their growth while discouraging already dominant firms from increasing their dominance. The EU parliament just rejected a measure to ease takeovers, and the underlying social and politial implications of EU's evolution in Europe are history in the making.

Germany is the natural EU leader. Twice last century it fought wars and lost. It was the priceless gift of a pardon by a farsighted, generous America that transformed it to a democracy and the third- largest world economy. America offered to fund the rebuilding of Europe only if its member nations were prepared to act as a single trading bloc -- which is the EU of today.

Germany internalized its own history. In a NATO meeting during the Kosovo bombing, someone defined German policy in Europe: "Beyond 2000, the Bundesbank (German federal bank) will be more important than the Bundeswehr (German Army)." Hard to believe? West Germany has plowed billions into East Germany since reunification. So when Washington recently pledged millions to help Poland modernize its tanks (to make them compatible with NATO's), perhaps Germany remembered what Washington forgot: its policy is to help Poland by giving tractors to Polish farmers.

No matter what Washington says, the military aid to Poland was a warning to Russia. When President Bush recently said "Russia is not our enemy," he went as far as domestic politics would allow. Political foes, many in the House, are reliving the Cold War, when Moscow was the enemy. They think of security only in terms of a missile defense umblella and a fortified eastern Europe, facing Russia.

The EU will not go along. The presence of 70,000 American troops in Germany is a reminder of the past, not a reason to forget it. Germany itself is investing in Russian industry, and the German-led EU is embracing Russia politically. It has adopted the U.S. post-war peace policy of inclusion, hoping that what happened to a defeated Germany then will happen to an economically devastated Russia today.

President Bush may sense this. He has met in the White House and talked with Mikhail Gorbachev, the man who de-Stalinized Russia. Business groups will be visiting Russia to promote trade, as Germans did two years ago. Aware that bureaucracy and corruption in the Yeltsin years hurt it, Russia, with German help, is adopting Western safeguards.

Russia is also an Asian power. When former Sen. Sam Nunn, our most knowledgeable statesman in matters of national security, left the Senate, he was disillusioned with the policy of humiliating Russia in Europe in the absence of a credible national interest. Nunn was concerned about our national interest in the Far East, where we are bound by treaty to defend Japan and South Korea. He was thinking of a potential supportive role by Russia, which shares frontiers with China and North Korea, the two nations threatening to destabilize the region. Perhaps this will also enter into the national security equation of the Bush administration.

GE to appeal against  Honeywell  ruling

Appeal General Electric  is to appeal against the  European Commission's decision to  reject its proposed merger with Honeywell.  Flight International sister on-line wire-service Air Transport Intelligence reports that the move is strategic rather than an attempt to resurrect a deal. An appeal could take months, preventing a GEcompetitor making a bid.

Honeywell,  GE Agree to Waive Certain Restrictions of Blocked  Merger Agreement

MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. --  Honeywell  International Inc. and  General Electric  Co. have granted each other permission to engage in certain activities before their  merger agreement is officially terminated without violating the terms of the pact.
The proposed $41 billion deal was blocked earlier this month by the  European Commission over antitrust
concerns, although the U.S. had  approved  it in May.

However, the merger agreement remains in place until Nov. 30, and the companies have yet to formally call it off. And while Honeywell (HON) has said it wants to remain independent, it may well become an acquisition target. Suitors include United Technologies Inc. (UTX), which agreed to acquire Honeywell last October before GE (GE) entered the picture with its bid.
Honeywell said Tuesday that it will file a copy of the consent with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Keeping the merger agreement in effect until Nov. 30 restricted Honeywell's (HON) ability to make major business
decisions without consulting GE (GE).

The merger agreement also required GE to use "reasonable best efforts" to win antitrust approval for the deal and to agree to certain measures, such as divestitures, as long as they didn't hurt Honeywell's business.

After a board meeting following the European Commission's decision, Honeywell's board made no comment about potential litigation against GE over the "reasonable-best-efforts" clause.

Honeywell said Tuesday that the waiver covers employment-related issues, acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, and the issuance or acquisition of securities. The consent otherwise preserves the companies' rights under the merger agreement.

With the merger blocked, GE Chairman Jack Welch will retire from the company at the Sept. 7 board meeting. Mr. Welch had named Jeffrey R. Immelt his successor last year, but he stayed on to oversee the acquisition of Honeywell, and had been expected to stay until the end of the year.

Meanwhile, Lawrence A. Bossidy has returned to run Honeywell, following the board's ouster of Michael R. Bonsignore as chairman and chief executive shortly after the European Commission announced its decision.

GE and Honeywell  Waive Constraints Of Merger Contract

General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. agreed to release each other from many constraints of their $39.93 billion merger contract, which remains in effect even though  European regulators killed the proposed transaction earlier this month.

Their latest agreement is the first major accommodation reached between the two since July 3, when the European Commission rejected GE's application to buy  Honeywell.  That same day,  Honeywell  named Lawrence A. Bossidy its chairman and chief executive, succeeding Michael R. Bonsignore, and charged him with devising a corporate turnaround strategy in the wake of the deal's meltdown.

The latest pact will free Mr. Bossidy's hands to start remaking Honeywell without needing to seek GE's approval on many major decisions, including hiring, firing or making other employee-related moves; buying or selling businesses or assets; or issuing or acquiring stocks, options or other securities.

Under the merger agreement reached last fall, which doesn't expire until Nov. 30, Honeywell had been constrained from making many major corporate decisions without written consent from GE. The company, based in Morris Township, N.J., even had to seek GE's approval before replacing Mr. Bonsignore.

"The consent agreement allows Larry Bossidy to move forward unencumbered with turning around the company," said Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane.

Honeywell continues to contemplate whether it has a legal case against GE, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., for violating the merger agreement by not giving "reasonable best efforts" to win approval for the deal. The company has retained law firm Kirkland & Ellis and attorney David Boies to advise on such a case. Mr. Bossidy said on July
3 that the company would make a decision on whether to sue, seek a settlement or simply agree to terminate the agreement "sooner rather than later."

EU Antitrust Watchdog  Gains Clout --- Monti Showed GE His Teeth First, Now He's Baring Them at Europe
--- He Plans to Target Corporate  Tax Breaks and Government-Affiliated Industries
By Philip Shishkin

BRUSSELS -- European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti has emerged from his rejection of General
Electric  Co.'s proposed merger with Honeywell  International Inc. as a stronger political figure at home.
He will need all the strength he can muster.

The 58-year-old Italian economist plans to target European mobile-phone companies, corporate tax breaks across the European Union, and government-affiliated industries in Germany, France and other nations. These closer-to-home targets have far more clout with the European policy makers who lobby Mr. Monti than distant U.S. firms.

Mr. Monti got a taste of the political reaction he is likely to engender when he plunged ahead with his first major post-GE actions last week, launching a wide-ranging probe into the legality of corporate tax breaks in eight EU member states.

The competition chief argues that selective tax treatment can amount to unfair state subsidies to companies and can therefore distort fiscal competition in the EU. But many national governments value such tax breaks as a way of luring economic investment into their countries. Scrapping the system, they argue, could push companies to move their facilities outside the EU.

Didier Reynders, Belgium's finance minister, went on the radio to warn Mr. Monti of having "to take responsibility" for any fracas that could develop if he challenges these tax breaks.

Another simmering issue on Mr. Monti's agenda is Germany's controversial system of extending preferential loans and other perks to state-controlled regional banks. Private-sector banks have complained for years that this system amounts to unfair state subsidies.

Mr. Monti agrees in principle and has asked the German government to reform the system. He is waiting for the Germans to come up with a proposal in September to overhaul the system but has warned them that the reforms must be far-reaching.

But over the years, German authorities have managed to delay these reforms. They argue that state-controlled banks carry out an important public service by financing small businesses and helping revive depressed industries. On Tuesday, German authorities and the commission held another meeting on the issue.

In France, Mr. Monti is also likely to face a politically difficult task in trying to curb the power of state-owned energy company Electricite de France. Mr. Monti's people are examining a complaint by an EDF competitor alleging that EDF abuses its market power at home while aggressively expanding in other EU countries by buying up local firms.

After the GE fight, some observers expected Mr. Monti to go slow and avoid picking fights with his European supporters. EU member states gave him unanimous political backing to halt the Honeywell acquisition despite sharp criticism from U.S. officials, including President George W. Bush.

But Mr. Monti has long demonstrated political independence despite heavy lobbying, and his current job, if anything, encourages his maverick streak. Unlike most of his fellow European commissioners, he doesn't need to
Page 98 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
submit his recommendations for rigorous and legally binding scrutiny by EU national governments and the European Parliament. This makes it easier for Mr. Monti and his powerful staff to pursue initiatives without worrying too much about their political fallout.

Honeywell  International Inc. and  General Electric  Co. removed a restriction on asset sales from their  merger
agreement, which is in effect through November even though  European regulators blocked the transaction.

GE and Honeywell  now can buy and sell assets or repurchase stock without notifying each other, spokesmen for the companies said.  Honeywell  would have had to pay a $1.35-billion fee if it violated the earlier terms.

Honeywell, which makes aerospace, automotive and chemical products, canceled plans to sell businesses with about $4 billion in sales after agreeing in October to be acquired by General Electric for $47 billion. GE said it also had restrictions on selling assets in the previous agreement.

Shares of Morris Township, N.J.-based Honeywell fell 19 cents to close at $35.90, while GE dropped off 11 cents to close at $46.11, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

Honeywell  has switched allegiances from Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom to Chicago firm Kirkland & Ellis in its ongoing battle with  General Electric  (GE).

After the failure to get  European Union competition clearance for a merger with GE, Honeywell  has instructed Kirkland to advise on a possible legal case against GE, on the basis that it violated the agreement by not giving reasonable best efforts to win  approval  for the deal.

Honeywell instructed Skadden Arps Brussels partner James Venit on the competition hearings, but has used Kirkland in the past for litigation. If litigation begins, Honeywell will become just the latest in a line of jilted merger partners turning to the courts with Kirkland's involvement.

Verizon ditched its investment plan in liquidated NorthPoint Communications, which prompted NorthPoint to sue, and US Airways has considered litigation against United Airlines after it indicated that it wanted out of the deal. Kirkland represented Verizon and United Airlines in both cases.

Honeywell  takes $651m merger hit - Meger - General Electric.

HONEYWELL International, the US industrial group, has taken a $651 million ( #465 million) charge to cover the cost of its failed  merger with America's  General Electric  (GE).

Honeywell  has been in a state of suspended animation for the past nine months as it pursued  regulatory clearance for a $42 billion  merger with GE. The European Union blocked the deal this month, claiming the enlarged company would have too much power in the aircraft industry.

The second-quarter exceptional charge includes the cost of hiring legal and financial advisers for the merger, and other costs such as customer contract losses. Including the charge, Honeywell's second-quarter net profits plunged 92 per cent from $617 million to $50 million. Underlying profits, which do not include the one-off expenses, totalled $450 million, against $605 million.

Sales for the quarter were $6.1 billion, down from $6.3 billion a year ago. Lawrence Bossidy, Honeywell's new chairman and chief executive, said: "Honeywell had a challenging second quarter in many areas."

NESTLE-RALSTON MERGER FEELS HEAT IN EUROPE FOR GE DEBACLE; EU ANTITRUST OFFICIALS
TAKE TOUGHER STANCE ON DEALS, EXPERTS SAY
By Thomas Lee Of The Post-Dispatch

General Electric  Co. Chairman Jack Welch could not secure  Europe's approval  of his company's $41 billion acquisition of Honeywell  International. Now, it appears that Nestle SA, the would-be owner of St. Louis-based Ralston Purina Group, is paying the price.

This week, Nestle, the world's largest food company, said it would sell off Ralston Purina product lines in three countries, would license certain brands and would divest assets to head off potential problems from  Europe's antitrust regulators. Given the  European Union's success in scuttling the  GE-Honeywell  union, some experts say the EU will take a tougher look at Nestle's pending $11 billion purchase of Ralston Purina. And Nestle, they say, is clearly feeling the heat.
Nestle's willingness to offer additional concessions to the EU "is a wise decision," said Tom Burnett, president of
Merger Insight, a New York research firm. "GE went through hell, and they didn't get (the deal) through."

For now, no one is suggesting that Nestle's bid for Ralston is in any immediate danger. A spokesman for Ralston said the company is still on schedule to complete the merger by year's end. Nevertheless, the EU's saber-rattling has thrown Nestle a bit off track, experts say. Between the EU and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the EU seemed more likely to green-light the deal.

Ralston is a relatively minor player in Europe. And unlike GE and Honeywell, two American companies, Nestle is based in Switzerland and presumably has the hometown advantage. Analysts expected Nestle to face tough scrutiny in the United States, where the two combined companies would control nearly half the U.S. pet-food market. Competitors have complained to the FTC that Nestle, with Ralston aboard, would use its considerable financial and marketing clout to push their products off supermarket shelves.

But two recent events might complicate Nestle's efforts in Europe. The tough stance on GE-Honeywell "is a pretty bad signal" for other companies with major mergers being considered by the EU, said Todd Milbourn, a professor of finance at Washington University's Olin School of Business.
If anything, it's just a matter of bad timing. The EU, he said, is "making Nestle jump through a few more hoops." Second, Mars Inc. said last week that it will buy Royal Canin, a French pet-food manufacturer, for $1.28 billion,
further diluting the competition in Europe.

Regulators there generally are more interested in protecting competitors from rival mergers than their U.S. counterparts, said Tim Greaney, a law professor at St. Louis University. U.S. regulators are much more willing to tolerate consolidation if it benefits consumers, he said. Companies making their pitch to the FTC typically contend that a merger will generate efficiencies that could be passed on to consumers through lower prices. Europeans
are skeptical of that argument, Greaney said.

But Greaney, a former Justice Department antitrust official, said the EU and the U.S. approach to antitrust law is similar, and it's rare the two sides will disagree, as they did with GE and Honeywell.

The main difference, Greaney said, is more style than substance. U.S. regulators review mergers knowing that they would have to prove their case to a judge if they objected to the deal. European regulators make their

decisions from a bureaucratic viewpoint. Though a company can appeal an EU decision in court, the process would take several years. GE, he said, was not willing to wait that long.

Besides GE-Honeywell, the EU has thrown its weight around before, most notably with its objection to the Boeing Co.'s 1997 acquisition of St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas. The episode almost led to a trade war between the United States and Europe.

Hood explains how the public affairs team is trying to correct some misperceptions.

Americans are just not used to seeing Jack Welch fail. The lionized  GE chairman postponed his retirement to navigate the  merger of GE and Honeywell  as a last hurrah before he hung up his corporate boots. Instead, following the decision by the European Commission (EC) to block the  merger, he will retire in September. The sense of anticlimax was almost palpable.

The failure has also given rise to a barely disguised anti-EC sentiment that has regularly spilled over into straightforward xenophobia. US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill called the decision 'off the wall.' The US media has also flavored its coverage with an anti-EC slant. An article in The New York Times described Mario Monti, the EC's competition commissioner, as 'a supporter of vigilant antitrust efforts, and his European colleagues have more power than regulators in the US.' Wilfried Schneider, deputy spokesman for the EC's Washington
delegation, recalls one particularly hostile newspaper article in which the journalist 'called the European bureaucrats fascists that are no more democratically legitimate than Adolf Hitler.'

Schneider is particularly dismayed by the fact that so many journalists drew a 'false' distinction between US and EC antitrust policy, suggesting that the EC considers competition as it affects businesses in its member states, while the US policy is only interested in competition as it affects the consumer. 'There is the wrong idea that it isn't about cartel and antitrust, but about getting rid of competitors, which is plain wrong,' says Schneider.

The EC rejected the merger because GE would not agree to make further concessions by divesting some of its business units.

It's in an effort to correct the misunderstandings that the EC has therefore stepped up its communication efforts in order to explain its role and its motivations. It's already well equipped to handle PR in the US, with two
delegations (to the US and the United Nations) and two public affairs offices. And Monti has made himself widely available to the US press, including interviews with Time and a satellite interactive discussion with the US Council for American Business.
EC's US communications team

The delegation to the US is based in Washington, employs four spokespeople, and is the principle office dealing with trade-related issues. The United Nations delegation is located in New York, and has six public affairs staffers. It is currently undergoing its own PR overhaul in an effort to project a unified voice from the 15 member states. No PR agencies are retained by either delegation.
'The message is that a united European Union can do so much more than a divided Europe,' says George
Cunningham, head of press and public affairs for the EC's UN delegation.

The Washington delegation handles all matters pertaining to the US, including trade, and has been dealing with the GE-Honeywell fallout. Mergers are only one part of the EC's remit in the US, however, and Schneider is keen to point out that environmental and agricultural issues are huge priorities.

He encourages regular press interaction with a weekly briefing called 'Entre Nous,' which brings together 15 journalists to review certain key issues.
Muscle flexing?

The EC's story is proving quite a tough sell, as some believe the GE-Honeywell decision was really a PR ploy in itself. 'My perception is that the EC, to some degree ... was just flexing its muscles to prove a point,' says John Hellerman, EVP at Levick Communications. 'Every eye was on the EC for this particular case. The fact that they didn't approve it suggests they wanted to make clear they are not some secondary regulatory body, but one that has significance.'

Schneider rejects that claim. 'You can't get it right with these people,' he says. 'The statistics show 392 successful mergers involving US companies, with only one merger having ever been rejected - the Sprint-MCI WorldCom merger. But because so few were rejected, (people) jump to the conclusion that it's a PR move. Whatever you do is wrong.'

But even PR chiefs in Europe agree that the EC is using this case for its image. 'The message coming out from this was the fact that the EU, just like the US, is fully entitled to review mergers between non-EU countries if it will impact trade and competition,' says Richard Aldwinckle, MD of Ketchum's global corporate practice in Europe. 'If
it is helping to persuade people on both sides of the Atlantic that these things have to be achieved through cooperation rather than railroading something through, the objective will have been achieved.'

Some, however, believe that Monti needs to be more open. Jack Welch describes Monti in Time magazine as, 'a gentleman, reserved. Charming but very formal. I don't know his inner soul.'
'He is a powerful character,' says Nick May, president of Ogilvy Europe.

'One thing that might be appropriate is to make himself more visible in the US, and more available to be challenged. If he really has a point of view to express, he needs a platform for doing that.'

There are signs that the EC is taking a conciliatory tone toward the US in an effort to ease any lingering tensions. Two articles in the Financial Times are imbued with a spirit of cooperation. Monti, in a piece entitled, 'Blocked deal leaves EC's Monti with just one regret,' the commissioner says, 'I would have liked to be able to authorize this merger, and I think we had been very close to that possibility.'

Monti claims that no 'rift' exists between the EC and the US. 'Certainly our interpretation of this article is it is really a PR exercise by Monti not to seem too aggressive,' says May.

Another article in the same issue of the Financial Times is entitled 'EU asks US for antitrust cooperation,' and describes an EC plan to work out strategies to prevent another GE-Honeywell situation from arising.
Communication lines were down

One of the problems with the merger was the fact that US regulators were notified of the plan months before the EC was. The implication is that had the EC and the US been informed simultaneously, discussions between regulating authorities on both sides of the Atlantic could have taken place.
That argument is being tested. 'We would refute several of the things Commissioner Monti is saying,' retorts
Louise Binns, a GE spokesperson.

'I think we would have some hesitation over whether there was an issue because of different timings on notification. We were talking to the EC from the moment of the October announcement.'

As for Honeywell, director of media relations Tom Crane declined to comment on the specifics of Monti's responses. However, Crane did offer that 'the timing and content seem a bit curious.'

As for Schneider, despite clear efforts to extend an olive branch, he admits that neither policy nor PR will necessarily prevent a huge difference of opinion in the future (between US and EC regulators). 'You cannot possibly coordinate every step while on the substances you have differences,' he says. 'It is a good aim in itself, but it cannot rule out that things will happen again when one side will have a different conclusion.'.

GENERAL Electric's  financing arm  GE Capital is paying $5.3 billion ( #3.8 billion) to buy Heller Financial, which specialises in lending to small and medium-sized companies, especially in the medical equipment, real estate and aircraft industries.

The deal is GE's first since its $42 billion mega-merger with Honeywell  was blocked by EU regulators and GE Capital's second-largest deal.  GE Capital will pay $53.75 a share for Chicago-based Heller, about 15 times earnings.
The deal will boost its assets by $20 billion to $390 billion. Document dt00000020010731dx7v000gx

GE Isn't Planning  To Slow Takeovers In Near Future --- Firm Could Face Challenge To Find the Right
Acquisitions

Since European regulators killed its $43 billion (49.08 billion  euro) proposal to acquire  Honeywell  International
Inc. four weeks ago, General Electric  Co. has avidly dived back into the  merger pool.

The reason: It needs to. More than many other big multinationals,  GE depends on acquisitions, lots of them, to help fuel its growth.

But can the huge conglomerate find enough small fish -- or better yet, a few big ones -- to keep its investors happy?

Over the past month alone, the company has announced five acquisitions, most of them the sort of very small deals of which GE has made a specialty. But the fifth, announced Monday, would be GE's second-largest deal ever. The conglomerate confirmed, as expected, that its big finance arm, GE Capital, plans to buy Heller Financial Inc. for $5.3 billion in cash, or $53.75 a share.

Acquisitions have been a huge force in GE's ballooning growth in recent years, even during the current downturn. Jeanne G. Terrile, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, recently estimated that of the 9.9% annual compounded revenue growth GE enjoyed from 1985 through 2000, four percentage points came from acquisitions. The company routinely makes 100 or more acquisitions a year, with the lion's share coming from GE Capital. Over the past two decades, that unit has grown from a tiny credit provider to be the world's largest nonbank financial-services company, with $370 billion in assets.

And that has contributed to GE's overall growth. Even without Honeywell, the company that longtime Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Welch Jr. will turn over in just a few weeks to his successor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, will
be much bigger than it was only a few years ago. GE's 2000 revenue of $130 billion was up $30 billion from 1998, while net income in 2000 of $12.74 billion was up 37% from the 1998 figure of $9.3 billion.

How long can this keep up? Though no one suggests that GE has yet reached a ceiling in either its ability to buy companies or integrate them, some investors wonder whether the company could hit an acquisition wall a few years down the road in its continuing drive to grow net income by 10% a year or more.

"It will become more challenging," says Bill Fiala, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis, who has a "hold" on the stock. "In five years, if their growth record stays on track, this is going to be a company that's making $25 billion a year, and the cash flow from their businesses is going to grow even faster. The pace of acquisitions is going to have to double over next few years to keep the double-digit growth alive."

For its part, GE promises more to come. "We will constantly be in the market for good acquisitions," says GE Capital Chairman and Chief Executive Denis J. Nayden in an interview, echoing comments of other GE executives. The acquisition world, he says is "part of the history of this company and part of the growth model of this company, not only for GE Capital, but for GE . . . In terms of our overall business model, we're optimistic about our business prospects."

One prospect, of course, is to do more big deals. Some analysts suggested Monday that the size of the Heller transaction, along with several other billion-plus deals at GE Capital this year, could be a sign that GE is thinking


Page 110 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
bigger. If the Heller pact is completed, it will rank second in size to GE's 1986 purchase of RCA Corp. for $6.4 billion.

But big deals could have problems of their own, if regulators decide to further place or explore any theoretical growth limits on GE. The company clearly isn't sure yet whether the European Commission's decision to strike down the Honeywell deal was a one-shot blow or a harbinger of increased scrutiny ahead on all fronts.

Indeed, Mr. Nayden is circumspect in assessing regulatory prospects for the Heller transaction, which must be approved in Europe as well as the U.S. "We're going to play right through the process here," he says. "We're not going to pre-judge it." He says the timetable is up to regulators but hopes the deal will close this year.

Warns Tom Mahowald, an analyst at American Express Financial Advisors, which owns about 52 million GE shares: "The Honeywell transaction may show those large acquisitions will be very difficult to do. And Jeff inherits a company already very large in many areas."

There's also a management issue. GE is well known as a skillful integrator of companies, and its many managers are steeped in the how-tos of completing mergers. The concern is that even GE, which Mr. Welch focused on streamlining and simplifying, can digest only so many deals, even small ones, at once without becoming overwhelmed. The number of key managers and sizable businesses in its stable has been mushrooming of late as GE has reorganized, especially at GE Capital, to accommodate growth.

Mr. Nayden responds that acquisitions "sometimes will be big, sometimes will be small, sometimes will be midsize. It's more a view as to how do acquisitions fit into the GE business model, then do we have the infrastructure, capacity and the people to evaluate, underwrite, close and integrate. We believe we do."

GE sees huge growth opportunities overseas, especially in Asia, as well as adding more services to existing product lines. Moreover, GE is generating increasing amounts of cash by focusing more on services that require less capital than products. It generated a record $7.8 billion in the first half of this year alone.

Merger Machine: Can GE Keep Growing  Through  Deals?

Corrections & Amplifications

GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.'S  GE Capital unit expects to add $250 million to earnings in its first year of ownership of Heller Financial Inc., and $1 billion over three years. A Heard on the Street article Monday incorrectly said
those figures referred to expected cost savings. (WSJ August 1, 2001)
Since European regulators killed its $43 billion proposal to acquire  Honeywell  International Inc. four weeks ago,
General Electric  Co. has avidly dived back into the  merger pool.

The reason: It needs to. More than many other multinational companies,  GE depends on acquisitions, lots of them, to help fuel its growth.

But, can the huge conglomerate find enough small fish -- or better yet, a few big ones -- to keep its investors happy?

Over the past month alone, the company has announced five acquisitions, most of them the sort of very small deals of which GE has made a specialty. But the fifth, announced yesterday, would be GE's second-largest deal ever. The conglomerate confirmed, as expected, that its big finance arm, GE Capital, plans to buy Heller Financial Inc. for $5.3 billion, or $53.75 a share.

Acquisitions have been an important force in GE's ballooning growth in recent years. Jeanne G. Terrile, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, recently estimated that of the 9.9% annual compounded revenue growth GE enjoyed from 1985 through 2000, four percentage points came from acquisitions. The company routinely makes 100 or more acquisitions a year, with the lion's share coming at GE Capital. Over the past two decades, that unit has grown from a tiny credit provider to become the world's largest nonbank financial-services concern, with $370 billion in assets.

That expansion has contributed to GE's overall growth. Even without Honeywell, the conglomerate that longtime Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Welch Jr. will turn over in just a few weeks to his successor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, will be much bigger than it was only a few years ago. GE's 2000 revenue of $130 billion was $30 billion more than in 1998, while its net income of $12.74 billion was up 37% from $9.3 billion.

Though no one suggests GE has reached a ceiling in its ability either to buy companies or integrate them, some investors wonder whether the conglomerate could hit an acquisition wall a few years down the road in its ongoing drive to increase its net by 10% or more a year.

"It will become more challenging," says Bill Fiala, an analyst at Edward Jones, a St. Louis brokerage house, who has a hold rating on the stock. "In five years, if their growth record stays on track, this is going to be a company that's making $25 billion a year, and the cash flow from their businesses is going to grow even faster. The pace of acquisitions is going to have to double over the next few years to keep the double-digit growth alive."

GE investors have come to count on that growth; the company's shares have outpaced the overall market over the past two decades, and the shares have fallen less than those of many other big companies over the past 12 months. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, GE was down $1.05 at $43.60, well below the
52-week high of $60.50 of last August.

There also is a management issue. GE is well known as a skillful integrator of companies, and its many managers are steeped in the how-tos of completing mergers. The concern is that even GE, which Mr. Welch has focused on streamlining and simplifying, can digest only so many deals at one time or risk becoming unwieldy, as the number of key managers and businesses in its stable mushrooms.

At GE Capital, Mr. Nayden says, acquisitions "sometimes will be big, sometimes will be small, sometimes will be midsize. It's more a view as to how do acquisitions fit into the GE business model, then do we have the infrastructure, capacity and the people to evaluate, underwrite, close and integrate. We believe we do."

GE sees huge growth opportunities overseas, especially in Asia, as well as in adding more services to its existing product lines. Moreover, GE is generating increasing amounts of cash by focusing more on services, which require less capital than does making products. The company generated a record $7.8 billion of cash in the first half of this year alone. That increasing cash hoard has to be spent somehow to avoid becoming a drag on earnings, giving GE more money to go on a shopping spree.

Mr. Immelt, who has argued that GE can expand even faster as it gets bigger, is expected to prod managers to think creatively about acquisitions in arenas and services the company might not yet be in, as well as pushing managers to capture talent or intellectual capital. At GE Medical Systems, the business he headed before he was named as Mr. Welch's successor last fall, Mr. Immelt pushed the maker of X-ray machines and CAT-scans into such areas as data mining and software.

Some insiders say the aborted Honeywell deal suggested new acquisition opportunities to some GE industrial businesses that aren't known as big buyers. Both GE Plastics and GE Industrial Systems, for instance, stood to make huge gains from Honeywell. Though that deal fell through, both units learned through the integration
process how new lines or businesses might fit into their existing products, and both are expected to become more active. Similarly, GE Aircraft Engines, which would have doubled in size with Honeywell and gained a wide array
of avionics products, still may be interested in buying certain avionics products from other companies, analysts say.

"I would challenge the assertion that, just because it's a $130 billion company, GE is going to have a harder time growing," says John Inch, an analyst at New York brokerage house Bear Stearns. "GE is a composite of many smaller companies." He says GE, while it has some geographic or product line dominance, "holds fairly small relative shares" in total sales of many of its global markets in industries such as power systems and medical equipment.

In buying Heller, GE Capital expects to achieve $250 million cost savings in the first year and $1 billion over three years, according to Mr. Nayden. Heller, of Chicago, has about 2,500 employees, two-thirds of which are in the U.S., with the others in London and Paris. The company specializes in commercial finance, equipment leasing
and real-estate financing. GE Capital also expects the deal to immediately add to its earnings, though it didn't

quantify by how much. Heller rose $17.09, or 48%, to $52.99 on the Big Board, after setting a 52-week high of
$53.05 intraday.
Morgan Stanley advised GE, while Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First
Boston advised Heller. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. advised Fuji Bank, Heller's controlling shareholder.

Source says GE is planning to appeal EU's rejection of Honeywellmerger

BRUSSELS (AP) _ General Electric  Co. plans to appeal the  European Union's decision to block its $41-billion
US merger with Honeywell  International Inc., a source familiar with the matter said Wednesday.

An appeal would not be aimed at reversing the European Commission's rejection of the merger. Instead,  GE wants to refute the  commission's finding that GE has a dominant position in the jet engine market, the source said on condition of anonymity.
That ruling, if allowed to stand, could make it difficult for GE to make future acquisitions.
The New York Times carried a similar report, citing unidentified executives close to the company. GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said ``we are still considering our options'' regarding the appeal.
The EU announced July 3 it was blocking the GE-Honeywell merger, the first time it ever bore sole responsibility for stopping an all-American deal.

GE has until the end of September to file an appeal at the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, court spokeswoman Fionnuala Connolly said, adding that none had been received yet.
If GE loses there, it can then go to the European Court of Justice, also in Luxembourg.

The court has never annulled a merger prohibition since the EU began reviewing them under current laws a decade ago.
Of six merger prohibitions appealed, three have been upheld and the others are pending, including last year's
WorldCom-Sprint deal, which was blocked on both sides of the Atlantic.

Antitrust lawyers complain that the European courts act too slowly to save deals, but say appeals can still be valuable in clarifying legal issues.

Top on the list in the GE-Honeywell case is the EU's reasoning that GE might have been able to drive competitors out of the aerospace market by offering customers a complete package of GE engines, Honeywell avionics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services.

That ``bundling theory'' was sharply criticized in the United States, where regulators are more inclined to allow businesses to pursue such synergies in part because U.S. regulators have more power to break up any monopolies that might result.
``I think the commission's decision will set a bad precedent for conglomerates like GE'' if allowed to stand, said
Fiona Carlin, an antitrust lawyer at Baker & McKenzie's European Law Center in Brussels.
An appeal is important ``so we get some clarity,'' she said.

When WorldCom announced its appeal last year, it said it did not want the EU's decision to ``become the basis for future commission actions or initiatives.''

That case, filed Sept. 27, is ``still in early stages'' because not all the written submissions have been received, Connolly said. No date for a hearing has been set.

General Electric  Remains Voracious For Acquisitions --- Some See Limits  Approaching To Growth by

Terrile, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, recently estimated that of the 9.9% annual compounded revenue growth GE enjoyed from 1985 through 2000, four percentage points came from acquisitions. The company routinely makes 100 or more acquisitions a year, with the lion's share coming at GE Capital. Over the past two decades, that unit has grown from a tiny credit provider to become the world's largest nonbank financial-services concern, with $370 billion in assets.

That expansion has contributed to GE's overall growth. Even without Honeywell, the conglomerate that longtime Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Welch Jr. will turn over in a few weeks to his successor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, will be much bigger than it was a few years ago. GE's 2000 revenue of $130 billion was $30 billion more than in
1998, while its net income of $12.74 billion was up 37% from $9.3 billion.

Though no one suggests GE has reached a ceiling in its ability either to buy companies or to integrate them, some investors wonder whether the conglomerate could hit an acquisition wall a few years down the road in its drive to increase its net by 10% or more a year.

"It will become more challenging," says Bill Fiala, an analyst at brokerage house Edward Jones, who has a hold rating on the stock. "In five years, if their growth record stays on track, this is going to be a company that's making
$25 billion a year, and the cash flow from their businesses is going to grow even faster. The pace of acquisitions is going to have to double over the next few years to keep the double-digit growth alive."

GE investors have come to count on that growth; the company's shares have outpaced the overall market over the past two decades, and the shares have fallen less than those of many other big companies over the past 12 months. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday, GE was down 2.4%, or $1.05, on the day at $43.60. The 52-week high of $60.50 was reached in August of last year.

GE sees huge growth opportunities overseas, especially in Asia, as well as in adding more services to its existing product lines. Moreover, GE is generating increasing amounts of cash by focusing more on services, which require less capital than does making products. The company generated a record $7.8 billion of cash in the first

half of this year. That increasing cash hoard has to be spent somehow to avoid becoming a drag on earnings, giving GE more money to go on a shopping spree.

Mr. Immelt, who has argued that GE can expand even faster as it gets bigger, is expected to prod managers to think creatively about acquisitions in arenas and services the company might not yet be in, as well as pushing managers to capture talent or intellectual capital. At GE Medical Systems, the business he headed before he was named as Mr. Welch's successor late last year, Mr. Immelt pushed the maker of X-ray machines and CAT-scans into such areas as data mining and software.

Some insiders say the aborted Honeywell deal suggested new acquisition opportunities to some GE industrial businesses that aren't known as big buyers.

"I would challenge the assertion that, just because it's a $130 billion company, GE is going to have a harder time growing," says John Inch, an analyst at brokerage house Bear Stearns. "GE is a composite of many smaller companies."

Heller shares rose 48% Monday, or $17.09, to $52.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, after setting a 52-week high of $53.05 intraday.
Morgan Stanley advised GE, while Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First
Boston advised Heller. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. advised Fuji Bank, Heller's controlling shareholder.

GE Planning  to Appeal EU Decision

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - General Electric  Co. plans to appeal the  European Union's decision to block its $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International Inc., a source familiar with the matter said Wednesday.

An appeal would not be aimed at reversing the European Commission's rejection of the merger. Instead,  GE wants to refute the  Commission's finding that GE has a dominant position in the jet engine market, the source said on condition of anonymity.
That ruling, if allowed to stand, could make it difficult for GE to make future acquisitions.
The New York Times carried a similar report, citing unidentified executives close to the company, in its
Wednesday editions.
GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said "we are still considering our options" regarding the appeal.

The EU announced July 3 it was blocking the GE-Honeywell merger, the first time it ever bore sole responsibility for stopping an all-American deal.

GE has until the end of September to file an appeal at the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, court spokeswoman Fionnuala Connolly said, adding that none had been received yet.
If GE loses there, it can then go to the European Court of Justice, also in Luxembourg.

The court has never annulled a merger prohibition since the EU began reviewing them under its current laws a decade ago.
Of six merger prohibitions appealed, three have been upheld and the others are pending, including last year's
WorldCom-Sprint deal, which was blocked on both sides of the Atlantic.

Antitrust lawyers complain that the European courts act too slowly to save deals, but say appeals can still be valuable in clarifying legal issues.

Top on the list in the GE-Honeywell case is the EU's reasoning that GE might have been able to drive competitors out of the aerospace market by offering customers a complete package of GE engines, Honeywell avionics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services.

That so-called "bundling theory" was sharply criticized in the United States, where regulators are more inclined to allow businesses to pursue such synergies in part because they have more power to break up any monopolies that might result.
"I think the Commission's decision will set a bad precedent for conglomerates like GE" if allowed to stand, said
Fiona Carlin, an antitrust lawyer at Baker & McKenzie's European Law Center in Brussels.
An appeal is important "so we get some clarity," she said.

When WorldCom announced its appeal last year, it said it did not want the EU's decision to "become the basis for future Commission actions or initiatives."

That case, filed Sept. 27, is "still in early stages" because not all the written submissions have been received, Connolly said. No date for a hearing has been set.
GE shares fell 70 cents to close at $42.80 in trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

GE To Appeal EU Decision  Blocking Honeywell  Deal - Source

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- General Electric  Co. (GE) is planning to appeal a  European Union Commission decision to block its $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International Inc. (HON), a source close to the deal said Wednesday.

The source said GE aims to appeal because it wants to overturn the Commission's ruling that it has a dominant position in the jet engine market. If the  Commission's decision stands, GE could run into antitrust difficulties in future merger transactions.

When E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti decided July 3 to block the deal, he said: "The combination would have resulted in the creation of dominant market positions in the markets for the supply of avionics,
non-avionics and corporate jet engines, as well as strengthening GE's dominant position in jet engines for large commercial and regional jets."

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer had no comment on news reports that GE is planning to appeal the Commission's decision.

The deadline to appeal is the end of September, two months and 10 days after the companies were notified of the decision.

GE and Honeywell are still operating under a merger agreement that runs until Nov. 30. Honeywell can't entertain rival bids while the agreement is in effect.

The source said that an appeal is likely because GE "has nothing to lose." He added that "there's no downside" to such a move.

When asked about the company's merger agreement with Honeywell, the source said it's likely that the agreement will be allowed to run out without either company deciding to annul it.
A GE decision to appeal won't affect a new bid for Honeywell, he said.
Some observers think aerospace rival United Technologies Inc. (UTX) will likely make another attempt at buying
Honeywell. United Technologies' bid for Honeywell last October was trumped by GE.

GE Reportedly Plans to Appeal EU Decision  Blocking Honeywell  Deal

BRUSSELS -- General Electric  Co. is planning to appeal the EuropeanCommission's decision to block its proposed $41 billion merger with Honeywell  International Inc., a person close to the deal said Wednesday.

GE (GE) wants to appeal in order to overturn the commission's ruling that it has a dominant position in the
jet-engine market, the person said. If the commission's decision stands,  GE could run into antitrust difficulties in
future merger transactions.

The executive arm of the European Union last month announced it was rejecting the GE-Honeywell deal, marking the first time the commission had stopped an all-American deal.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said at the time that combining the two companies would have resulted in the creation of dominant market positions in the markets for the supply of avionics, nonavionics and corporate jet engines, and would also strengthen GE's dominant position in jet engines for large commercial and regional jets.
GE spokesman Gary Sheffer declined to comment Wednesday on news reports that GE is planning an appeal. The deadline for appealing is the end of September. Meanwhile, GE and Honeywell (HON) are still operating
under an agreement that runs until Nov. 30, and Honeywell can't entertain rival bids while the agreement is in
effect.

The person close to the deal said an appeal is likely because GE "has nothing to lose" and "there's no downside" to such a move.
A GE decision to appeal won't affect a new bid for Honeywell, the person said.
Some observers think aerospace rival United Technologies Inc. (UTX) probably will make another attempt to buy
Honeywell. United Technologies' bid for Honeywell last October was trumped by GE's offer.

GE, Morris Township, N.J., and Honeywell, Fairfield, Conn., agreed in mid-July to release each other from many constraints of their merger contract. That agreement freed Honeywell's new Chairman and Chief Executive Lawrence A. Bossidy to start remaking Honeywell without needing to seek GE's approval on many major decisions.

Separately, GE on Wednesday expressed disappointment with the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to dredge PCBs from the Upper Hudson River, saying the move will "cause more harm than good."

GE said the massive dredging project is a loss for area residents who "overwhelmingly oppose this project and the decades of disruption it will bring to their communities."

GE has opposed the $460 million plan, one of the largest dredging operations ever, because it would have to foot most of the bill for the cleanup.

GE discharged 1.3 million pounds of PCBs from its plants into the northern Hudson River until 1977, when the substance was banned by the federal government. Polychlorinated biphenyls have been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.

Heard on the Street
GE Remains Voracious At the Acquisition Table --- Denial of Honeywell  Hasn't Dulled the Appetite  ---
Some See Limits  Approaching to Growth by Ingestion

Since European regulators killed its $43 billion proposal to acquire  Honeywell  International Inc. four weeks ago,
General Electric  Co. has avidly dived back into the  merger pool.

It needs to. More than many other multinational companies,  GE depends on acquisitions, lots of them, to help fuel its growth.

But, can the huge U.S.-based conglomerate find enough small fish -- or better yet, a few big ones -- to keep its investors happy?

Over the past month alone, the company has announced five acquisitions, most of them the sort of very small deals of which GE has made a specialty. But the fifth, announced Monday, would be GE's second-largest deal ever. The conglomerate confirmed that its finance arm, GE Capital, plans to buy Heller Financial Inc. for $5.3 billion, or $53.75 a share.

Acquisitions have been an important force in GE's ballooning growth in recent years. Jeanne G. Terrile, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, recently estimated that of the 9.9% annual compounded revenue growth GE enjoyed from 1985 through 2000, four percentage points came from acquisitions. The company routinely makes 100 or more acquisitions a year, with the lion's share coming at GE Capital. Over the past two decades, that unit has grown from a tiny credit provider to become the world's largest nonbank financial-services concern, with $370 billion in assets.

That expansion has contributed to GE's overall growth. Even without Honeywell, the conglomerate that longtime Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Welch Jr. will turn over in a few weeks to his successor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, will be much bigger than it was a few years ago. GE's 2000 revenue of $130 billion was $30 billion more than in
1998, while its net income of $12.74 billion was up 37% from $9.3 billion.

Though no one suggests GE has reached a ceiling in its ability either to buy companies or to integrate them, some investors wonder whether the conglomerate could hit an acquisition wall a few years down the road in its drive to increase its net by 10% or more a year.

"It will become more challenging," says Bill Fiala, an analyst at brokerage house Edward Jones, who has a hold rating on the stock. "In five years, if their growth record stays on track, this is going to be a company that's making
$25 billion a year, and the cash flow from their businesses is going to grow even faster. The pace of acquisitions is going to have to double over the next few years to keep the double-digit growth alive."

GE investors have come to count on that growth; the company's shares have outpaced the overall market over the past two decades, and the shares have fallen less than those of many other big companies over the past 12 months. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday, GE was down 2.4%, or $1.05, on the day at $43.60. The 52-week high of $60.50 was reached in August of last year.

For its part, GE promises more to come. "We will constantly be in the market for good acquisitions," says GE Capital Chairman and Chief Executive Denis J. Nayden, echoing the comments of other GE executives. The acquisition world, he says is "part of the history of this company and part of the growth model of this company, not


Page 128 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
only for GE Capital, but for GE. . . . In terms of our overall business model, we're optimistic about our business prospects."

One prospect, of course, is to do more big deals. Some analysts suggest that the size of the Heller transaction, along with several other billion-dollar-plus deals at GE Capital this year, may be a sign GE is thinking bigger. If the Heller purchase is completed, it will rank second in size to GE's 1986 purchase of RCA Corp. for $6.4 billion.

However, big deals may bring other problems, if regulators decide to place or explore any growth limits on GE. The company isn't sure whether the European Commission's decision to strike down the Honeywell deal was a one-shot blow or a harbinger of increased scrutiny on all fronts.
Indeed, GE Capital's Mr. Nayden is circumspect in assessing regulatory prospects for the Heller transaction,
which must be approved in Europe, as well as in the U.S. "We're going to play right through the process here," he
says. "We're not going to prejudge it." He says the timetable is up to regulators, but he hopes the deal will close
this year.

Warns Tom Mahowald, an analyst at American Express Financial Advisors, which owns about 52 million GE shares: "The Honeywell transaction may show those large acquisitions will be very difficult to do. And Jeff inherits a company already very large in many areas."

There also is a management issue. GE is well known as a skillful integrator of companies, and its many managers are steeped in the ways of completing mergers. The concern is that even GE, which Mr. Welch has focused on streamlining and simplifying, can digest only so many deals at one time or risk becoming unwieldy, as the number of key managers and businesses in its stable mushrooms.

At GE Capital, Mr. Nayden says, acquisitions "sometimes will be big, sometimes will be small, sometimes will be midsize. It's more a view as to how do acquisitions fit into the GE business model, then do we have the infrastructure, capacity and the people to evaluate, underwrite, close and integrate. We believe we do."

GE sees huge growth opportunities overseas, especially in Asia, as well as in adding more services to its existing product lines. Moreover, GE is generating increasing amounts of cash by focusing more on services, which require less capital than does making products. The company generated a record $7.8 billion of cash in the first half of this year. That increasing cash hoard has to be spent somehow to avoid becoming a drag on earnings, giving GE more money to go on a shopping spree.

Mr. Immelt, who has argued that GE can expand even faster as it gets bigger, is expected to prod managers to think creatively about acquisitions in arenas and services the company might not yet be in, as well as pushing managers to capture talent or intellectual capital. At GE Medical Systems, the business he headed before he was named as Mr. Welch's successor late last year, Mr. Immelt pushed the maker of X-ray machines and CAT-scans into such areas as data mining and software.

Some insiders say the aborted Honeywell deal suggested new acquisition opportunities to some GE industrial businesses that aren't known as big buyers. Both GE Plastics and GE Industrial Systems, for instance, stood to make huge gains from Honeywell. Though that deal fell through, both units learned through the integration
process how new lines or businesses might fit into their existing products, and both are expected to become more active. Similarly, GE Aircraft Engines, which would have doubled in size with Honeywell and gained a wide array
of avionics products, still may be interested in buying certain avionics products from other companies, analysts say.

"I would challenge the assertion that, just because it's a $130 billion company, GE is going to have a harder time growing," says John Inch, an analyst at brokerage house Bear Stearns. "GE is a composite of many smaller companies." He says GE, while it has some geographic or product-line dominance, "holds fairly small relative shares" in total sales of many of its global markets in industries such as power systems and medical equipment.

In buying Heller, GE Capital expects to achieve $250 million of cost savings in the first year and $1 billion over three years, according to Mr. Nayden. Heller, of Chicago, has about 2,500 employees, two-thirds of which are in the U.S., with the others in London and Paris. The company specializes in commercial finance, equipment leasing and real-estate financing. GE Capital also expects the deal to immediately add to its earnings, though it didn't quantify by how much.

Heller shares rose 48% Monday, or $17.09, to $52.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, after setting a 52-week high of $53.05 intraday.

GE-Honeywell  failure puts chemicals in play.

The European Commission has blocked a merger between General Electric  and Honeywell.  This has also stopped the formation of a giant engineering polymer company from a merger of GE Plastics and Performance Polymers and Chemicals. Commentators believe  Honeywell  has now been left so vulnerable that a takeover or merger with another partner cannot be far off. And the chances are that the chemicals business will have to be sold separately.  Honeywell's  Peformance Polymers and Chemical division's products include nylon, polyester, PE and fluoropolymer plastics, as well as speciality chemicals and fine chemicals. 10,000 are employed and the division employs 10,000.

General Electric  Co. plans to appeal the  European Union's decision to block its $41 billion  merger with
Honeywell  International Inc., a source said today.

An appeal would not be aimed at reversing the European Commission's rejection of the merger. Instead,  GE wants to refute the  Commission's finding that GE has a dominant position in the jet engine market. That ruling, if allowed to stand, could make it difficult for  GE to make future acquisitions.
GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said, "We are still considering our options" regarding the appeal.

The EU announced July 3 it was blocking the GE-Honeywell merger, the first time it ever bore sole responsibility for stopping an all- American deal. GE has until the end of September to file an appeal.

Antitrust lawyers complain that the European courts act too slowly to save deals but say appeals still can be valuable in clarifying legal issues.

Top on the list in the GE-Honeywell case is the EU's reasoning that GE might have been able to drive competitors out of the aerospace market by offering customers a complete package of GE engines, Honeywell avionics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services. GE's aircraft engines unit is based in Evendale.
That so-called "bundling theory" was sharply criticized in the United States. Document cinp000020010802dx810002a

General Electric  to appeal EC block of merger with Honeywell: report
182 words

WASHINGTON, Aug 1 (AFP) -  General Electric  is planning to appeal against a decision by the  European          Commission on July 3 to block its proposed 45-billion-dollar  merger with Honeywell  International, The New
York Times said Wednesday.

GE does not intend to resurrect the deal, executives close to the company told the daily, but is seeking to nullify the EC ruling that the  merger would have left  GE-Honeywell  with "dominant positions" in the markets for the supply of avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines.

If left unchallenged, the sources said, the ruling could hinder future acquisition by GE, since it certifies the view of European regulators that the company already has a dominant position in manufacturing jet engines which power large commercial and regional jet aircraft.

The appeal would have to be filed by the end of September with the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. It would be the seventh appeal filed by a company against an EC decision to block a deal, the daily said.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - General Electric  Co. intends to appeal the  European Union's decision to block its dlrs 41 billion-merger with Honeywell  International Inc., a source close to the deal said Wednesday.

An appeal would not be aimed at reversing the European Commission's rejection of the merger. Instead,  GE wants to refute the  Commission's finding that GE has a dominant position in the jet engine market, the source said on condition of anonymity.
That ruling, if allowed to stand, could make it difficult for GE to make future acquisitions. A GE spokeswoman in Fairfield, Connecticut, did not return a call seeking comment.
The EU announced July 3 it was blocking the GE-Honeywell deal, the first time it ever bore sole responsibility for stopping an all-American deal.

GE has until the end of September to file an appeal at the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, court spokeswoman Fionnuala Connolly said, adding that none had been received yet.
If it loses there, GE can then go to the European Court of Justice, also in Luxembourg.

The court has never annulled a merger prohibition since the EU began reviewing them under its current laws a decade ago.
Of six merger prohibitions appealed, three have been upheld and the others are pending, including last year's
Worldcom-Sprint deal, which was blocked on both sides of the Atlantic.

Antitrust lawyers complain that the European courts are too slow to save a deal, but say an appeal can still be valuable in clarifying legal issues.

Top on the list in the GE-Honeywell case is the EU's reasoning that GE might have been able to drive competitors out of the aerospace market by offering customers a complete package of GE engines, Honeywell avionics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services.

That so-called "bundling theory" was sharply criticized in the United States, where regulators are more inclined to allow businesses to pursue such synergies in part because they have more power to break up any monopolies that might result.
"I think the Commission's decision will set a bad precedent for conglomerates like GE" if allowed to stand, said
Fiona Carlin, an antitrust lawyer at Baker & McKenzie's European Law Center in Brussels.
An appeal is important "so we get some clarity," she said.

When WorldCom announced its appeal last yar, it said it did not want the EU's decision to "become the basis for future Commission actions or initiatives."

That case, filed Sept. 27, is "still in early stages" because not all the written submissions have been received, Connolly said. No date for a hearing has been set.

Investors keep Honeywell  rolling along - Though EU derailed merger with GE, many see Bossidy getting
firm back on track

Weeks after  European regulators scuttled its acquisition by  General Electric  Co., Honeywell  International Inc. is still standing. That seemingly unremarkable feat is drawing some investors to the stock like, well, bees to honey.

Who would have guessed  Honeywell's  shares would outperform GE's in the aftermath of their scuttled $41 billion deal? Honeywell,  after all, was the stumbling giant that needed GE to rescue it from a gloomy future caused by management mishaps, deteriorating businesses and employee defections. But  Honeywell's  shares, which closed yesterday at $36.72, have gained 7.7 percent since July 2, while  GE's are off 14.7 percent. The deal was blocked July 3.

A better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report has helped. But a bigger boost has been the re- emergence of Lawrence Bossidy, who left last April following the AlliedSignal merger, as chief executive. Bossidy's return gave the company something it sorely lacked: credibility with Wall Street.
Investors are jumping into the stock, expecting Bossidy will fix up Honeywell within a year and sell it. The
66-year-old CEO is credited with turning around AlliedSignal in the early 1990s, and has a reputation as an
aggressive cost-cutter with a no-nonsense approach.

Honeywell has 2,700 employees in New Jersey spread among its Morris Township headquarters and operations in Teterboro and Freehold.
Investors hope a leaner, meaner Honeywell can fetch more than the $50 a share GE was willing to pay for it.
But some analysts and company observers offer a piece of advice for those investors betting on a turnaround at
Honeywell in a year: Curb your enthusiasm.

Even with Bossidy at the helm, the slowing economy could push out any meaningful recovery at Honeywell well beyond a year. And the potential downturn in airplane production is expected to constrain growth at Honeywell's main business, the aerospace division.

In the near-term, the shares could be volatile as the company struggles to deliver positive results for the rest of the year. Bossidy needs to move fast to sell off underperforming assets, such as the chemicals business.
But business is so weak that divesting that operation now won't fetch top dollar, said senior capital goods analyst
Tom Leritz with Banc of America Capital Management, a Honeywell shareholder.
Even bulls think a year may be too soon to get Honeywell back on track.

Bossidy has said he has one year to stabilize Honeywell. If he is successful, the board will consider putting the company up for sale.
But the majority of Honeywell observers think Honeywell won't be an independent company in a year.


Page 143 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"A year from now, Honeywell will be a part of another company and it'll be that company's job to turn it around," said Michael Holton, a portfolio manager with T. Rowe Price, a Honeywell shareholder.
Some think aerospace rival United Technologies Inc. will make another attempt at buying Honeywell. United
Technologies' bid for Honeywell last October was trumped by GE.

United Technologies lobbied hard against the GE-Honeywell merger, something that likely won't be forgotten by GE or Honeywell. Bossidy has told his top staff that a bid by the company would not be welcome, according to a report in Forbes magazine.

GE might lobby hard against a United Technologies-Honeywell hookup, too, suggested Michael Zhao, an analyst with money management firm Federated Investors.

GE and Honeywell still are operating under a merger agreement that runs until Nov. 30. Honeywell can't entertain rival bids while the agreement is in effect. And if reports that GE plans to appeal European Union regulators' rejection of the merger are correct, that could block other takeover bids for a year.

Some observers think GE and Honeywell won't appeal the EU decision. Instead, they will let the merger agreement run out, or negotiate terms favorable to both companies.

However, a source familiar with the matter told The Associated Press GE will appeal, not to reverse the EC's rejection of the merger, but instead to refute the commission's finding that GE has a dominant position in the jet engine market. That ruling, if allowed to stand, could make it difficult for GE to make future acquisitions.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the conglomerate hasn't decided yet what it will do, and said he doubted an appeal would block takeover attempts for Honeywell.

If that's the case, United Technologies or another suitor should make a run at Honeywell sooner rather than later, when an improved Honeywell could command a higher price tag, said Eric Longmire, senior managing director of Wyser-Pratte & Co., a Honeywell shareholder.

In announcing Bossidy's appointment as CEO, Honeywell cut earnings guidance for the second quarter. Last week, the company was able to beat analysts' estimates, reporting operating earnings of 55 cents a share. Though net fell sharply under a ton of charges, the stock gained a bit, as investors were relieved the results weren't worse.

Honeywell also reaffirmed $2.15 to $2.30 a share guidance for 2001, which would be well below year-ago earnings of $2.83 per share.

City - GE in court bid over failed merger.

GENERAL Electric,  the huge US conglomerate, is planning to take the  European Commission to court in the wake of its collapsed $42 billion  merger with Honeywell.

The company wants the EC's ruling that it has a monopoly in the aerospace industry revoked so that it can pursue other acquisitions in the sector. It is not expecting to put the Honeywell deal back on track, however.
GE is likely to face an uphill battle. Few EC decisions have ever been overturned and the case will be heard at
the European Court of Justice, which is seen as friendly with the Commission. The appeal must be lodged before
the end of September. A GE spokesman, while declining to discuss details, said: "We are considering our
options."

Insiders say the company has nothing to lose by posting an appeal and believes the EC's decision was flawed. EU competition commissioner Mario Monti blocked what would have been the biggest industrial takeover ever because he claimed it would create a "dominant position" in several markets.

GE to appeal EU finding on Honeywell merger, source says

General Electric  Co. plans to appeal the  European Union's decision to block its $41 billion (U.S.)  merger with
Honeywell  International Inc., a source familiar with the matter said yesterday.

An appeal would not be aimed at reversing the European Commission's rejection of the merger. Instead,  GE wants to refute the  commission's finding that GE has a dominant position in the jet-engine market, the source said on condition of anonymity.
That ruling, if allowed to stand, could make it difficult for GE to make future acquisitions.
The New York Times carried a similar report, citing unidentified executives close to the company. GE spokesperson Gary Sheffer said "we are still considering our options" regarding the appeal.
The EU announced July 3 it was blocking the GE-Honeywell merger, the first time it bore sole responsibility for stopping an all-American deal.

GE has until the end of September to file an appeal at the court of first instance in Luxembourg, court spokesperson Fionnuala Connolly said. If GE loses there, it can go to the European court of justice, also in Luxembourg.

General Electric  Co. plans to appeal the  European Union's decision to block its $41 billion  merger with
Honeywell  International Inc., a source said Wednesday.
An appeal would not be aimed at reversing the  rejection of the merger. Instead,  GE wants to refute the
European Commission's finding that  GE has a dominant position in the jet engine market, the source said.
That ruling, if allowed to stand, could make it difficult for GE to make future acquisitions.
The New York Times carried a similar report Wednesday, citing unidentified executives close to the company. GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said "we are still considering our options" on the appeal.
The EU announced July 3 that it was blocking the GE-Honeywell merger, the first time it ever bore sole responsibility for stopping an all-American deal.
GE has until the end of September to file an appeal at the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Document trib000020010802dx8200053

GE PLANS TO APPEAL EU FINDING

General Electric  Co. plans to appeal the  European Union's decision to block its $41 billion  merger with
Honeywell  International Inc., a source familiar with the matter said yesterday.

An appeal would not be aimed at reversing the European Commission's rejection of the merger. Instead,  GE wants to refute the  commission's finding that GE has a dominant position in the jet engine market, the source said on condition of anonymity.
That ruling, if allowed to stand, could make it difficult for GE to make future acquisitions.

The New York Times carried a similar report, citing unidentified executives close to the company, in its editions yesterday.
GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said, "We are still considering our options."
Honeywell employs the equivalent of more than 2,800 full-time employees in the Richmond-Petersburg, Va., area. The EU announced July 3 it was blocking the GE-Honeywell merger, the first time it ever bore sole responsibility
for stopping an all-American deal.

GE has until the end of September to file an appeal at the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, court spokeswoman Fionnuala Connolly said, adding that none had been received yet.

If GE loses there, it can then go to the European Court of Justice, also in Luxembourg. The court has never annulled a merger prohibition since the EU began reviewing them under its current laws a decade ago.
Of six merger prohibitions appealed, three have been upheld and the others are pending, including last year's
WorldCom-Sprint deal, which was blocked on both sides of the Atlantic.

Antitrust lawyers complain that the European courts act too slowly to save deals but say appeals can still be valuable in clarifying legal issues.

Tops on the list in the GE-Honeywell case is the EU's reasoning that GE might have been able to drive competitors out of the aerospace market by offering customers a complete package of GE engines, Honeywell avionics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services.

That so-called "bundling theory" was sharply criticized in the United States, where regulators are more inclined to allow businesses to pursue such synergies in part because they have more power to break up any monopolies that might result.
"I think the Commission's decision will set a bad precedent for conglomerates like GE" if allowed to stand, said
Fiona Carlin, an antitrust lawyer at Baker & McKenzie's European Law Center in Brussels.
An appeal is important "so we get some clarity," she said.

When WorldCom announced its appeal last year, it said it did not want the EU's decision to "become the basis for future Commission actions or initiatives."

That case, filed Sept. 27, is "still in early stages" because not all the written submissions have been received, Connolly said. No date for a hearing has been set.
