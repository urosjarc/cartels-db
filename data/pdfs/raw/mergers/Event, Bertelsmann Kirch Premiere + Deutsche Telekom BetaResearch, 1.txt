Bertelsmann/Kirch face EU pay-TV deadline.

BRUSSELS, April 27 (Reuters) - German media firms  Bertelsmann AG and Leo Kirch have until later today to notify changes to their proposed digital pay-TV alliance to alleviate concerns about reduced competition, a European Commission spokesman said on Monday.
But this deadline could be extended if the companies were willing to make concessions.

"The deadline to make formal changes is today," spokesman Stefan Rating said, adding there would be a meeting between Kirch and Bertelsmann representatives and commission competition officials.
"If today Bertelsmann and Kirch make proposals that look promising, it would be within the discretion of
(Competition Commissioner Karel) Van Miert to extend the deadline," the spokesman said.
Rating declined to speculate on the outcome of the meeting.

The Commission has said it will not give its blessing to the plan, under which Kirch and Bertelsmann would merge the Premier pay-TV company with Kirch's DF1 digital channel, due to concerns that their control of decoder technology and expensive film and sports rights would give them a lasting monopoly.
The Commission has formally until June 3 to take a final decision. (C) Reuters Limited 1998.

Kirch, Bertelsmann to meet EU officials today.

BRUSSELS, April 27 (Reuters) - Representatives of German media groups Bertelsmann AG and Leo Kirch were expected to meet  European Commission competition officials later today, a Commission official said on Monday.

"There will be a meeting with DGIV (Competition directorate general)," the official said when asked whether the firms had submitted changes to their proposed alliance.
Bertelsmann Chief Finance Officer Siegfried Luther was quoted on Sunday by the Welt am Sonntag newspaper
as saying that both groups were ready to put forward on Monday detailed proposals for adjustments in their digital
pay-TV deal.
The Commission has objected to the agreement, which would pool successful Premiere pay-TV company with
Kirch's digital channel, on the grounds that it create a lasting monopoly.
European competition chief Karel Van Miert was also quoted by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on
Monday, as saying time was running out for the two companies to make proposals.
The Commission, the EU's clearing house for large mergers and takeovers, has officially until June 3 to take a
final decision on the Kirch/Bertelsmann plan. But merger verdicts are usually announced one or two weeks before
the legal deadline.

Under EU merger control law, companies must address concerns about reduced competition at the latest one month before the deadline elapses to give the Commission time to consult a committee of merger experts from the 15 EU states.

Bertelsmann, Kirch Attempt  To Mollify  EU

Kirch Group and  Bertelsmann AG's TV arm, CLT-Ufa, said they proposed changes to their planned digital-television venture in an effort to overcome opposition from  European Union antitrust authorities.

The companies said the offer was made at talks with EuropeanCommission competition officials late Monday, but they declined to elaborate. "We are making proposals; we still have the aim of reaching an approval," said Johannes Schmitz, a spokesman for Kirch. Mr. Schmitz said the companies had no further comment at this stage.

The EU's competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, repeatedly has warned that the commission will block the venture if it isn't modified. Mr. Van Miert argues that the link-up risks closing off the German pay-TV market to other competitors. In 1994, the commission blocked a cable- and pay-TV venture involving the same parties.

A commission spokesman declined to comment on Monday's talks, which came just before the commission's formal deadline for the companies to offer concessions. In practice, the commission can extend this deadline to allow for additional negotiations, but it has to make a final ruling on the case by late May.

There has been speculation -- denied by the companies -- that one way to satisfy the commission would be for the new digital pay-TV service to be distributed through a group of cable operators, instead of using Deutsche Telekom AG's vast cable network. Under the planned venture, CLT-Ufa and Kirch will take joint control of Premiere, Germany's leading pay-TV channel, and Kirch's existing digital pay-TV service, DF1, will be merged into Premiere. In addition, the companies have agreed to distribute programs over Deutsche Telekom's vast network through another company known as BetaResearch.

EU/COMPETITION - LAST PHASE OF CONSULTATIONS IN BERTELSMANN-KIRCH AFFAIR.

(c) 1998 Agence EUROPE, Brussels Not Available for Re-dissemination. .
Brussels, 27/04/1998 (Agence  Europe) - The European Commission was expecting the proposals aimed at making "substantial" and "adequate" changes to the planned merger "Premier Medien", which involves, notably the German giants  Bertelsmann and Kirch on Monday, last deadline according to the date set in January, said the service of the spokesperson. The Community antitrust authorities were to meet representatives of the parties involved, later afternoon, for last minute technical talks before engaging on the last furlong of the in-depth enquiry that has now been going on for three months (see  EUROPE of 24 and 31 January, pp.12-13 and p.11, respectively). The  Commission has not therefore taken a final stance on this issue that it should in principle be closing by the end of May.
A possible extension of the deadline, to allow the parties to make "constructive proposals", would be up to
Commissioner Karel Van Miert, under the new procedures that came into effect in March (see EUROPE of 4
March, p. 12 and 11 February, pp.6-7), the spokesperson stressed.

EU Awaits Details Of Kirch-Bertelsmann Digital-TV Venture In Writing

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission expects German media giants Kirch Group and Bertelsmann AG to submit written responses to EU concerns about their digital-television venture, a commission spokesman said Tuesday.

CLT-Ufa, the TV arm of  Bertelsmann and Luxembourg broadcaster CLT, plan with rival Kirch to take joint control of Premiere, Germany's leading pay-TV channel. Kirch will merge its existing digital pay-TV service, DF1, into Premiere. Through another company known as BetaResearch, the partners plan to distribute programs over Deutsche Telekom AG's vast cable network.

Stafan Rating, spokesman for EU Competition Chief Karel Van Miert, said commission officials met with senior executives of Kirch and Bertelsmann Monday to hear the companies' oral proposals.

Rating added that the commission gave the companies a few days to submit the proposals in writing, saying "we won't make any comment on the proposals until we receive them."

The commission is conducting an in-depth inquiry into the digital-TV alliance, because of fears it would smother competition in the emerging digital market if it were to go ahead as planned. The EU competition watchdog is also examining the cable network aspect of the digital alliance.

Digital television promises a huge number of channels along with superior picture and sound quality. The commission's view is that in the nascent digital market, the same groups shouldn't control both access to the channels and program content - in particular films and sports rights, which are likely to be the most popular among digital subscribers.

Kirch and CLT-UFA called a truce earlier this year, agreeing to use Kirch's "d-box" as their standard decoder for digital TV.

The commission said the advertising campaign carried out by Bertelsmann and Kirch to market their d-box technology was illegal, as the merger hasn't been approved by EU regulators. It added that the marketing gave
the impression that the d-box is already the definitive digital standard for the German market, which isn't the case.

Bertelsmann, Kirch Move To Allay EU Concerns.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuters) - After months of fruitless talks, media groups  Bertelsmann AG and Kirch have offered proposals to allay  European Commission fears that their digital television plan might create a monopoly in Germany,  EU and company officials said Tuesday.

Although both sides were tight-lipped on the proposals' substance, there were signs the two partners may be able to avert a ban on their alliance with  Deutsche Telekom to get digital TV off the ground in Germany.
"The parties made some proposals orally," commission spokesman Stefan Rating told a news briefing, referring
to a meeting late Monday between the European Union's executive body and representatives of Bertelsmann and
Kirch.
"We gave them a couple of days to submit (the proposals) in writing," he said.
Monday was the deadline for the two partners to notify the commission of changes to their agreement filed for
European Union regulatory clearance in December, Rating said.

In January, the commission opened a full-scale inquiry into the deal amid concerns it would give the companies a lasting monopoly over the German pay-TV market.

Under the terms of the deal, Kirch and CLT-UFA, the television joint venture between Bertelsmann and Audiofina, would merge Germany's only successful pay-TV channel, Premiere, with Kirch's DF1 digital TV company.

Monday's meeting was attended by media mogul Leo Kirch himself, Kirch's chief executive officer Dieter Hahn, Bertelsmann's head of entertainment Michael Dornemann and its head of finance Siegfried Luther, Rating said.
CLT spokesman Mathias Wolf declined to comment, other than to say the meeting had been constructive.
"The talks yesterday were very constructive, they took three hours and we made our proposals," he told Reuters. The commission fears that Kirch's huge film and sports rights together with its control of set-top decoder
technology to unscramble pay-TV programmes will create an insurmountable barrier to new market entrants.

The use of Deutsche Telekom's cable TV network to carry the channels to homes, which is the subject of a separate investigation, only reinforces concerns of reduced competition in the German-speaking market - Germany, Austria and part of Luxembourg - where CLT-UFA is based.
The commission, the EU's clearing house for large mergers and takeovers, has the support of the German Cartel
Office, which vowed to block the alliance if given the chance.

The commission has legally until June 3 to give its verdict, but it usually adopts merger decisions one or two weeks before the deadline.
An advisory committee of merger experts from the 15 EU states will meet May 6 to give its opinion on the German
TV deal, Rating said.
This means the commission's merger task force must have a preliminary decision ready by then. Reuters/Variety.

BRUSSELS, April 28 (Reuters) - After months of sterile talks, media groups  Bertelsmann AG and Kirch have made proposals to allay  European Commission fears that their digital television plan may create a monopoly in Germany, EU and company officials said on Tuesday.

Although both sides were tight-lipped on the proposals' substance, there were signs the two partners may be able to avert a ban on their alliance to pool forces with  Deutsche Telekom to get digital TV off the ground.

CLT-UFA says EU German TV deal talks constructive.

BRUSSELS, April 28 (Reuters) - CLT-UFA, the television joint venture between Bertelsmann and Audiofina , said on Tuesday it and German media group Leo Kirch had "constructive" talks with the European Commission on Monday over conditions to clear their German digital TV alliance.
"The talks yesterday were very constructive, they took three hours and we made our proposals," CLT spokesman
Mathias Wolf told Reuters.

But he declined to comment on the substance of the talks or whether the Commission's competition officials judged the joint proposals sufficient to overcome fears the two partners could have a lasting monopoly of the German pay-TV market.
Commission spokesman Stefan Rating said on Monday the companies had until yesterday to notify changes to
the deal under which they would merge Premiere, Germany's only successful pay-TV company, with Kirch's ailing
DF1 digital TV channel.

He added that European competition chief Karel Van Miert could stretch the deadline if the talks were "promising and constructive".
Rating declined to comment on Monday on the outcome of the talks and was not available on Tuesday morning. The Commission has legally until June 3 to give its verdict, but it usually adopts merger decisions one or two
weeks before the deadline.

According to sources close to the talks, the Commission has convened a meeting on May 6 of an advisory committee of merger experts from the 15 EU states to give its opinion on the German TV deal.
This means the Commission's merger task force must have a preliminary decision ready by then.

EU investigations into controversial mergers have shown deadlines are often not met and the advisory committee can meet more than once. The most significant example was the merger last year of Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas where a compromise was reached within hours of the Commission ruling. (Amelia Torres +32 2 287

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Prospective German digital pay TV partners KirchGroup and Bertelsmann have won a few days grace to present new proposals on their merger plan to the European Commission. This follows representations from a delegation led by media mogul Leo Kirch.
The formal deadline for submissions expired at midnight Monday.

The commission had said earlier that it would block the proposed creation of a combined Premiere digital channel unless modifications were made to allow other market entrants to compete freely (HR 4/28).

The broadcasters have been granted "a couple of days" in which to make a written proposal, said Stefan Rating - spokesman for competition commissioner Karel van Miert- after a meeting Tuesday. "The parties did make some proposals orally, so we did give them the time to make them in writing."
Rating declined to comment on the nature of the proposals, although he did confirm that no representatives of
Deutsche Telekom were present.

He also said there was no discussion of BetaResearch, the company responsible for the access technology and "d-box" decoder, which would be jointly owned by Deutsche Telecom, Kirch and Bertelsmann's 40%owned subsidiary, CLT-UFA.

Kirch was accompanied by Siegfried Luther, Bertelsmann's chief financial officer; Michael Dorneman, head of Bertelsmann's music and electronic media arm, BMG Entertainment; and Dieter Hahn, a Kirch managing director and legal counsel.

The commission's competition division will study the Kirch-Bertelsmann response before deciding whether to postpone a decisive May 6 meeting.

BERTELSMANN AND KIRCH ORALLY PRESENT A REVISED "PREMIERE MEDIEN" ALLIANCE PLAN, WHICH THE COMMISSION WILL EXAMINE.

Brussels, 28/04/1998 (Agence Europe) - The German groups Bertelsmann and Kirch have agreed to review their project of alliance in the digital television sector, to avoid the European Commission veto. The new proposals were presented to the Community antitrust services orally on Monday, by a 12-member delegation of which Mr Kirch was also part. This approach, which came just at the agreed deadline and one month from the final verdict in Brussels, did not give rise to any official Commission reaction. The spokesman simply confirmed that the
consultative committee on competition matters will indeed tackle the "Premiere Medien" case on 6 May as initially planned. Last week, Commissioner Karel Van Miert had recalled that, as there were no new proposals to remove our reticence to this alliance, the Commission would have no other choice than to ban it. He expressed irritation,
in the weekly Wirtschaftswoche, about the attempts at political intervention coming from Germany. He said, "we are used to France or other Member States putting pressure on. But it is remarkable and somewhat worrying that Germany also is now starting to do the same".

At present, the Commission services are awaiting the written text of the revised project for alliance, so it may carry out its detailed examination.

GERMAN DIGITAL TV ALLIES SET TO SUBMIT NEW PROPOSAL.
407 words

EURREP
English
(c) 1998 European Report.
Media groups CLT-Ufa and Kirch are preparing to submit a modified set of proposals in a bid to have their planned digital television link-up in Germany approved by the  EU competition watchdog. A 12-strong delegation, led by Munich-based magnate Leo Kirch and including CLT-Ufa parent company Bertelsmann's Finance Director Siegfried Luther, were in Brussels on April 27 for a meeting with officials of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition (DG IV), where they verbally outlined a number of alterations they now intend to make to the proposed merger of their digital TV services and a separate alliance with German telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom to distribute programmes through the cable network (for full details of their plans and the Commission's objections see  European Report N degrees s 2301, 2287, 2285, 2283).

Neither side revealed details of the verbal offer, but it is understood to address the EU executive's concerns that the merged entity would be able to deny rivals access to vital technology and also maintain a stranglehold on popular film and sport programme content.

In an interview on April 24 with the German weekly Wirtschaftswoche, Karel Van Miert, European Commissioner for Competition, urged the two groups of companies to review their initiative, otherwise the Commission, which fears a monopoly situation, might decide to ban the alliance by invoking EU merger control rules. Kirch and Bertelsmann signed an agreement on November 8, 1997 to combine the Kirch (DF1) digital TV platform, which has failed to make a big commercial impact, with the sole German subscriber-only channel, Premiere. EU competition officials have been conducting an in-depth examination of the Bertelsmann-Kirch-Deutsche Telekom link-up since January and sent out a formal statement of objections to the plans in March. A full-scale hearing took place in Brussels with the parties and their critics on April 1/2. Under EU Merger Regulation procedures, the Commission must reach a final decision on the case by June 3.

Although the official deadline has now passed for last-minute changes to the deal, a Commission spokesman confirmed that DG IV would now await a written version of the new proposals before commenting further on the situation. The spokesman explained that the Commission was generally willing to grant an extension where a new draft "looks promising and constructive".

BERTELSMANN/KIRCH MAKE LATE EU APPEAL
593 words
29 April 1998

Vol. 3, Issue: 9

In a last-minute bid to win regulatory approval, German media companies Bertelsmann/CLT-UFA and Kirch-Group have attempted to change the negative view of the European Commission concerning their planned alliance in the digital pay-TV market. Leading executives from both companies including  Bertelsmann's director for financial and legal affairs, Siegfried Luther, intended to propose several modifications of their
collaboration agreement to the members of the regulatory body at a meeting in Brussels on Monday. According to sources close to the EU Commission, this meeting is the last chance the German companies have to change the general opinion of the Commission, which has indicated on several occasions that it will block the alliance under its current conditions as it would prevent competition and lead to a monopoly in the pay-TV market in the
German- speaking countries.

In a newspaper interview last week, EU Commissioner Karel van Miert revealed that the agreement would not receive a green light unless Bertelsmann and Kirch-Group proposed modifications, adding that this has to happen before the end of April. Denying speculation that he has already made a decision, van Miert said the he was still prepared to "recommend to my colleagues in the commission a positive decision in this case." However, this
would happen only if the companies proposed acceptable modifications. According to van Miert, the final decision will be made by June 6. Meanwhile, the head of the German cartel office, the Bundeskartellamt, Dieter Wolf, indicated that in his view, the blocking of the alliance by his colleagues in Brussels seemed possible. Wolf said that he is concerned that Bertelsmann and Kirch- Group could extend their collaboration from the pay-TV
business to their advertising-supported channels such as RTL and SAT.1, the leading commercial TV channels in Germany, thus creating a dominant force in both the pay-TV and the free-to-air market. Kirch-Group has again confirmed that it will scrap its loss- making digital bouquet DF1 if the alliance with Bertelsmann is blocked. According to Kirch's managing director Dieter Hahn, DF1 wouldn't have a chance on its own against Premiere. Currently DF1 has 160,000 subscribers while Premiere has 1.65 million subscribers, including 120,000 homes acquired for its digital bouquet before the EU Commission blocked the renting of Kirch-Group's d-box decoder by Premiere until its probe was complete. Hahn indicated that he is still optimistic about the outcome of the investigation, but Kirch- Group would have to stop the DF1 venture if the merger with Premiere wasn't allowed. In this case, some of the 1,000 jobs created as part of the Munich-based company's digital activities would be endangered, he added. Meanwhile, Bertelsmann's television business sister company CLT- UFA indicated that it wouldn't accept strict limitations placed on its activities by the EC. "We won't and can't accept any conditions which would endanger the economic prospects of our digital pay-TV project in Germany," CLT-UFA's managing director Rolf Schmidt-Holz said. "Otherwise there won't be pay-TV at all." In reaction to fears by the cartel bodies
that Bertelsmann and Kirch-Group could extend their alliance from the pay-TV to the free- to-air television market, he pointed out that this wouldn't be possible as CLT-UFA is only majority shareholder in RTL, adding that RTL, RTL 2, Super RTL and VOX weren't a family because of their different shareholder structure.

BERTELSMANN AG and Kirch have made proposals designed to allay  European Commission fears that their German digital TV deal would create a monopoly. Although both sides have refused to give details, a spokesman for Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said there were signs that the two partners might be able to avert a ban on their plans to pool forces with  Deutsche Telekom to get digital TV off the ground. An advisory committee
of member states' merger experts will meet next Wednesday (6 May) to give its opinion on the deal. This means the Commission's merger task force must have a preliminary decision ready by then, said the spokesman.

PAY-TV venture Nethold Mediterranean BV will file a complaint with the  Commission against alleged stalling by Greek state television channel ERT over its bid for a licence, the chief executive said this week. The move comes more than a year after Nethold applied to ERT for a licence for digitally-encrypted broadcasting.

THE Commission is not seeking "the disappearance or the bankruptcy" of France's Credit Lyonnais in its battle over aid given by the French state, Economics Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy insisted in an interview this week. But he added that the parties concerned must "find a solution to correct the errors of the past and not give the bank a discriminatory advantage over its competitors in the future". Paris has vowed to fight any Commission veto of financial aid to Credit Lyonnais, saying it will privatise the state-owned bank next year but will not be rushed into a sale. Angry Credit Lyonnais staff staged a protest in front of the Commission's Brussels headquarters this week.

AMERICAN Airlines' deal with US Airways Group Inc faces Commission scrutiny after the institution has completed its probes into several transatlantic pacts. The Union has authority over the deal because it will allow US Airways Group greater access to the EU's skies through the alliance between American Airlines and British Airways. The Commission is now finalising its reviews of the BA/AA alliance, the link-up between United Airlines, Lufthansa and SAS, and a number of other transatlantic aviation deals. Van Miert has warned that Lufthansa AG, United Airlines and SAS must expect to forfeit up to 100 slots per week in Germany in return for EU approval for their planned alliance.

THE Commission will hold a closed-door hearing on 12-13 May on the proposed merger between US telecom firms WorldCom Inc and MCI Communications. The hearing, which will be open to rival companies and interested parties, follows the issuing of a statement of objections outlining the Commission's fears about reduced competition in the supply of Internet backbone services.

FURTHER cuts in world shipbuilding capacity should be made to help promote the sector's competitiveness, Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann said this week. He told a London conference that shipyards needed to embrace new technologies to maintain their competitive edge, but that cuts should not necessarily fall on European shipbuilders which had already undergone severe restructuring.

Kirch offers film rights  to save Bertelsmann deal.

BRUSSELS, April 30 (Reuters) - German media mogul Leo Kirch has offered to sell 25 percent of output-rights to Hollywood films, and to license production of digital decoders in order to win  European Commission approval for his television alliance with  Bertelsmann.

The proposals were detailed in a letter to the  Commission on Tuesday, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters on Thursday.
But they are unlikely to satisfy anybody.
The German Federal Cartel Office said on Wednesday the concessions were insufficient and German cable TV
operators and rival broadcasters were expected to voice further concerns.

Kirch owns Europe's biggest film library and has output-deals with Hollywood majors Warner, Disney, Columbia, Paramount, Universal and Fox which give it the right to buy most films produced in future.

A source close to the talks said the 25 percent of rights to films which had not been produced yet were not enough to enable a company to start a film channel and there was no mention of sports rights, which Kirch also has in abundance.

The proposal to license the production of decoder boxes also met with scepticism, as it was unclear how disputes over licensing terms would be settled despite suggestions for an arbitration body.
"We don't think the conditions go far enough and are too vague. The devil is in the detail," the source said. Interested parties had until tonight to file their comments with the Commission, the source said.
The Commission declined to comment on the proposals. It will consult a committee of merger experts from the 15
EU states on May 6 before taking a final decision, possibly on May 20 or 27.

Dieter Wolf, president of the German cartel authority, told reporters the proposals did not relieve concerns about a digital TV monopoly in Germany.
After years of bitter rivalry, Kirch and Bertelsmann announced last summer they were pooling efforts to get digital
TV off the ground with the cooperation of former telecommunications monopoly Deutsche Telekom.
The deal involves Kirch and CLT-UFA, the TV joint venture between Bertelsmann and Audiofina, to merge
pay-TV company Premiere with Kirch's ailing digital TV channel DF1 and to use decoder technology developed
by Kirch's BetaResearch.

The cornering by powerful pay-TV companies like Kirch and Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB in Britain of the rights to some popular sports has also sparked a heated debate over whether such events should automatically be shown on free television.
The German authorities are drawing up a list of sports events that must be available to all viewers.
But the list is considered deficient by some, as it features mainly big events like the Olympic Games and the
World Cup Soccer finals which take place only every four years.

European Commission (EC) opposition to the German digital venture proposed by CLT-Ufa, the Kirch Group
and Deutsche Telekom (DT) will delay the hiving off of DT's cable activities and the entry of outside investors, an
industry source warned this week. The move followed comments from  EC sources that the partners have still not
offered remedies to comply with competition rulings. An  EC source confirmed there was contact between the
commission and the partners last week but the ventures have proposed 'nothing whatsoever' in structural
changes. The well-placed industry source said: 'DT has already announced that it is going to sell or take in
investors in cable TV but it will be pretty difficult if there is no digital TV in Germany. The  commission is holding
up the development of digital TV.'.

The Kirch Gruppe and Bertelsmann AG are considering changes to their digital pay TV proposal, in order to mollify the European Commission's competition investigators. The Wall Strret Journal  Europe reports that the companies, who had up to now vigorously opposed any modifications to the prospective DF1 service, backed down after meeting with officals last Monday. Neither side would comment on what any changes might involve. The German media giant was threatening to shut down its digital television service, DF1, if the  European Union blocked its proposed merger with  Bertelsmann AG's Pay-TV channel, Premiere. Kirch's MD, Dieter Hahn, was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying that the service, "has no hope of staying alive on its own." He also intimated that Kirch saw no benefit in fighting the  EU's decision if the ruling, which is due by June 2, went against the company.

The Union's competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, had demanded changes to proposals for the Pay TV alliance, to be submitted by the end of this month, if the entire venture was not to be vetoed by the directorate. Under the terms of the original deal Kirch would have transferred the assets of DF1 and its sports channel, DFS, into Premiere, which would have then become the sole Pay TV provider. The service would have been distributed by Deutsche Telecom.

In a two-day antitrust hearing, media giants the Kirch Group and Bertelsmann defended themselves against European Commission charges of monopoly by claiming that the EC made "highly speculative" assumptions and failed to consider relevant facts before making its accusations. The deal, the execution of which awaits the outcome of the hearing, merged the digital television interests of the two companies and included plans for marketing Kirch's decoder as the standard. A study conducted by Wernhard Moeschel, a professor of economic law, alleges that the  commission made "incorrect assessments" and acted prematurely in making its charges.

Brussels has until June 3 to render its judgment, after which the companies are planned to continue meeting with the commission in order to ensure regulatory clearance. In addition to the involved parties, the hearings were attended by Deutsche Telekom and the European companies that objected to the merger.

BRUSSELS, May 4 (Reuters) - German public television broadcaster ARD on Monday sharply criticised the proposed digital TV alliance between  Bertelsmann and the Kirch group, saying it would create a monopoly in Germany.
ARD Head of International Relations Andreas Weiss said that an offer made by the companies last week to the
European Commission did not alleviate concerns about market dominance.

Kirch offered to sell 25 percent of its output rights to Hollywood films and to licence the manufacturing of its digital set-top decoders.

But even the film concessions were insufficient, said Verena Wiedemann, head of ARD's Brussels EU affairs office.

Without "killer applications" such as exclusive film and sports rights, no company would be able to start a competing TV operation, she said. The only way to prevent Kirch and Bertelsmann from getting a gate-keeping position was for them, "to give up control of BetaResearch" at the company, which owns exclusive and unlimited licences for the decoder technology.

Kirch and CLT-UFA, the television joint venture between Bertelsmann and Audiofina , plan to take joint control of German pay-TV channel Premiere and to merge it with Kirch's digital TV company DF1. The deal also involves CLT-UFA and former telecommunications monopoly Deutsche Telekom taking stakes in BetaResearch, which is now a 100-percent Kirch unit.

The deal, says ARD, would totally eliminate competition between long-time foes Kirch and Bertelsmann and would see the withdrawal of France's Canal Plus from Germany. Canal Plus is a shareholder in Premiere.

ARD is worried that its own digital platform plans will be scuppered, or that it will be forced to use Kirch's set-top boxes on Kirch's terms because Telekom has announced it would use only Kirch's technology to carry digital programming through its cable TV network.

"Bertelsmann and Kirch are already too strong and Deutsche Telekom is still a monopolist...it would always end up in market dominance," Weiss said.

ARD is a network of German public broadcasters. ARD digital aims to provide better quality television and radio programmes and a range of interactive services. It has invested in its own decoder technology, which it says should be compatible with Kirch's, as customers are unlikely to invest in more than one box.

EU Still Unhappy With Kirch, Bertelsmann.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuters) - The  European Commission will propose to antitrust experts from the 15
European Union states Wednesday to block a television alliance between Bertelsmann AG and Leo Kirch
unless the companies meet the body's competition concerns, a commission source said Monday.
The source said proposals offered by the two German media firms last week were "not enough" to alleviate the
commission's fears about creation of a dominant position in the German-speaking pay-TV market.

German public television broadcaster ARD Monday also sharply criticized the proposed digital TV alliance, saying it could undermine its own digital platform plans.

Kirch has offered to sell off 25 percent of "output" rights to Hollywood films and to licence the manufacturing of its key digital decoder technology.

But the film concessions were insufficient, Verena Wiedemann, head of ARD's Brussels EU affairs office, told Reuters and The Financial Times. She added that "killer applications" such as exclusive film and sports rights were essential for the success of competing operations.

ARD's head of international relations, Andreas Weiss, also said the only way to prevent Kirch and Bertelsmann from achieving a gatekeeping position through their decoder technology advance was for them "to give up control of BetaResearch."

BetaResearch is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kirch, which owns exclusive and unlimited licences for the set-top decoder boxes.

The commission's competition department will propose to ban the deal in a preliminary draft decision at the meeting of the merger advisory committee Wednesday.
But talks are likely to continue between the commission and the companies as the EU executive body has until
June 3 to render its final verdict.

Cable companies have complained about the deal, and the German Cartel Office also has said that last week's proposals did not go far enough.

Under the proposed deal, Kirch and CLT-UFA, the television joint venture between Bertelsmann and Audiofina, would assumejoint control of the successful German pay-TV company Premiere and merge it with Kirch's digital company DF1. Canal Plus currently owns a stake in Premiere.
Former telecommunications monopoly Deutsche Telekom and CLT-UFA also would share control in
BetaResearch with Kirch.

Germany - Viag Interkom  Offers Discount Phone Calls

HAMBURG, GERMANY, 1998 MAY 4 (NB). Confirming plans laid down at the beginning of the year, Viag Interkom has pitched into the discount German telecoms market with an extremely competitive portfolio of discount long distance and international calling tariffs.

Under the European Commission mandated telecoms market liberalization that started at the beginning of the year, customers of Deutsche Telekom can now route calls through a growing number of indirect carriers across most of Germany.

As reported by Newsbytes last December, Viag Interkom wants to offer a one-stop shop for both wireless -- GSM (global system for mobile communications) 1800 -- and landline telecoms service. That plan is still on target, but in the meantime, the telecommunications firm will be offering very low cost calls to Deutsche Telekom subscribers.

As reported previously by Newsbytes, Viag Interkom plans to roll out its new cellular network using a microwave transmission network, allowing the new GSM phone operator to rapidly roll out its cellular base stations in Germany, without the need to locally interface the stations into the fixed wire networks.

In September of last year, Viag selected Ericsson Microwave Systems in Sweden and Bosch Telecom of Germany to supply the complete first phase of the new microwave transmission network. The order covered some 8,000 Ericsson Mini Link E short-haul digital microwave radios, Newsbytes notes.

It is this network that Viag is exploiting with its discount calling rates for German businesses, Newsbytes notes. The rates announced late last week offer discounts of between 15 and 30 percent when compared to Deutsche Telekom's rates, Newsbytes understands.

Officials with Viag said that they expect to sign up around 180,000 residential customers this year, twice as many as previously forecast, thanks to the low calling rates, which start at 46 pfennigs per minute during office hours and half that rate during off-peak times.
Viag's Web site is at  http://www.viag.de.

Kirch, Bertelsmann Seen Making Further Concessions.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuters) - German media firms Bertelsmann AG and Leo Kirch are expected to make further concessions to win the European Commission's blessing for their digital television alliance, a commission official said Tuesday.

The companies told the  European Union executive body in a meeting that "they would submit something in writing," only days after they made proposals to meet the competition concerns expressed by the  commission.
Kirch and Bertelsmann are under pressure from the commission to modify their deal, which would merge
Germany's pay-TV channels Premiere and Kirch's DF1, or face a prohibition.

On April 27, Kirch offered to sell 25 percent of its "output" rights to Hollywood films, a key ingredient for successful pay-TV, and to licence the manufacturing of its digital set-top decoders.

But rival broadcasters and cable companies remain critical of the merger plans, and the commission's merger department also believes that the proposals do not go far enough.

The commission will step up pressure on Kirch and Bertelsmann on Wednesday by asking an advisory committee of merger experts from the 15 EU states to back a preliminary draft decision to block the deal in its current form.
But talks are expected to continue as the commission has until June 3 to take a final ruling. Reuters/Variety.

DIGITAL TV - NEGATIVE RULING LOOMS FOR GERMAN ALLIANCE.
806 words
6 May 1998
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 1998 European Report.
Media groups CLT-Ufa and Kirch and their cable operator ally  Deutsche Telekom are facing a negative Decision from the European Commission under EU competition rules on their planned digital television link-up in Germany unless they are prepared to make further concessions on the way the deal is set up. A fresh set of proposals submitted by the partners on April 28 does not go far enough to allay the  Commission's competition concerns and a preliminary ruling against the Premiere joint venture is expected to be tabled to the  EU Advisory Committee under  EU Merger Regulation procedures on May 6. A final Decision is due to be taken by the 20
Commissioners on May 27, with a final deadline of June 3.

CLT-Ufa - which comprises the television interests of German media concern Bertelsmann - and Kirch are planning to merge their digital television businesses into a single enterprise - called Premiere - which will use the set-top decoder box already developed by Kirch to provide encrypted pay-TV to their subscribers. A separate venture - Betaresearch - owned by the two partners in conjunction with Deutsche Telekom, would provide the technical platform for these services. In January, the Commission warned that the two joint ventures which are the basis of the deal appeared to threaten fair competition by creating a stranglehold on both the technical standard and the programme content inventory of films and sports rights which are the staple of any successful digital package. Since then, the partners have been trying to allay the fears of the EU competition watchdog (for further details, see European Report N degrees s 2301, 2287, 2285 and 2283).
The latest concessions.

In their April 28 letter, the parties attempt to address the outstanding issues by offering fresh concessions in the five basic areas of technical standards, equipment manufacturing, programme content, subscription packages and relations with rival cable-TV providers. They followed this up in a meeting with Commission officials on May
1.

Programming: The Premiere partners have offered to make available to rival providers over a period of several years 25% of the television rights to Hollywood films and other vital content held by Leo Kirch. Furthermore, to reduce the potentially awesome purchasing power of the parties involved, Premiere would buy in on its own account only those TV rediffusion rights to the programmes which it required, and avoid "bundling" such
purchases with the free-TV rights held by Kirch and Bertelsmann for their other television channels - in which they are supposed to remain competitors.

Subscriptions: Premiere now undertakes not to force customers to subscribe to a basic programme package before they are entitled to tune in to the films and big-event sports broadcasts which are the real attraction of digital pay-TV.

Technical platform: Bertelsmann, Kirch and Deutsche Telekom agree to license other television providers to use their conditional-access system, based on Kirch's d-box. Given that the three partners will initially be the only digital-TV business operating in Germany, their system is set to become the de facto standard. Hence any unwillingness to allow access to this technology would effectively block any new entrants from the market.

Manufacturing: Although the parties have signed an exclusive contract with Nokia to manufacture the set-top boxes (with a guaranteed purchase order for a million boxes), they now agree to supply specifications to rival equipment makers so that these rivals can put their own equivalent product on the market in competition with Nokia.
Cable firms: Premiere/Betaresearch will agree to cooperate with cable network operators other than Deutsche
Telekom. However, the partners will not allow programme packages to be broken down and re-arranged by cable

firms who contract to purchase. Financial rebates may be arranged for those firms wishing to take only a part of the package.
Proposals "too vague".

Bertelsmann and Kirch management announced after the Labour Day meeting that it had been "constructive". However, Commission officials warned that the proposals still need to be fleshed out before the EU competition watchdog can approve the two merger deals. The Commission will want, for example, to ensure that fully objective criteria are used in assessing applications for manufacturing licences or access to the decoder
technology. "As the proposals stand, it would appear that Bertelsmann and Kirch have the power of decision over who gets access to these technologies. It's all rather vague.", said one official close to the case. Arrangements must therefore be made for arbitration, where necessary. Another question mark hangs over the offer to cede
25% of the film rights. Which 25% would this be, and how could the cession be managed? The name of media magnate Rupert Murdoch has already been bruited about as a possible buyer of these rights.

Kirch, Bertelsmann try again to appease the EC And Bertelsmann hope new concessions submitted to EC
will help prevent blocking of proposed joint German digital  pay TV project

BRUSSELS, Belgium - German media groups Kirch and Bertelsmann said Tuesday that they hope new concessions submitted today to the EuropeanCommission will be enough to prevent blocking of their proposed joint German digital pay TV project at a key meeting of competition experts.

The European Commission reiterated Monday that it intends to recommend blocking the alliance unless Kirch and Bertelsmann meet its antitrust concerns.

But a spokesman for CLT-UFA - the Luxembourg-based broadcaster, 40% owned by Bertelsmann AG, that hopes to tie up with Leo Kirch's DF1 digital service -said new written proposals promised by Kirch and CLT-UFA executives Friday during a meeting with the commission in Brussels were sent Monday night.

He declined to discuss the proposals' content but said the companies were confident they could convince the panel not to block the merger.

"We certainly hope so, otherwise we wouldn't have given new proposals," the spokesman said." The discussions between the commission and the companies will go on."

A spokesman for competition commissioner Karel van Miert insisted that the panel's opposition to the merger remains but indicated that the alliance's fate is unlikely to be decided today

He said the commission will use the meeting "to try to get a feel for how its member states feel about the new proposals." He said the likelihood of the panel rejecting the latest offer outright as "theoretical".

Last week, in the first attempt at compromise since the commission warned of its inclination to block the merger because of fears that the alliance's broadcasting rights and control of decoder technology would create a monopoly in the German-speaking market, Kirch offered to sell 25% of its output rights to Hollywood films and to license the manufacture of its digital set-top decoders.

Bertelsmann pessimistic on digital  TV pact.

LEIPZIG, Germany (Reuters) - The chairman of German media group  Bertelsmann AG said Thursday the European Commission will probably reject the company's planned pay-television alliance with Bavarian media tycoon Leo Kirch.

EC Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert is expected to make a final ruling on the alliance by June 3. But a panel of advisers from  EU member states recommended this week that he reject the tie-up.
"I believe they are going to reject it," said Bertelsmann Chairman Mark Woessner, who was at a meeting of the
American Chambers of Commerce in Germany.

Woessner said the companies had tried to convince Brussels they would make the basic pay-TV decoder technology needed for programming available to any program operator at the same cost as to the companies themselves.

"I cannot understand the way Van Miert is thinking. He is pursuing an industry policy that will be prohibitive," Woessner told Reuters.

Woessner said pay TV accounted for less than 1 percent of the total television market and that whether the companies initially had a monopoly should not be seen as prohibiting competition in the future.

Someone had to build the infrastructure for a new market, he said, adding that Bertelsmann and Kirch "were prepared to lay the information highway for pay TV.

"The consequence of this decision will be that other conglomerates will form, for example, Kirch and (News Corp. Ltd's owner Rupert) Murdoch, and isn't that power?" he said.

Sources told Reuters this week the negative recommendation of the EC panel came despite an offer by Kirch and Bertelsmann to sell 25 percent of BetaResearch, the Kirch subsidiary that controls key digital set-top decoder technology.

In January, the EC expressed concern that Bertelsmann and Kirch would achieve a lasting dominance of the German pay-TV market by merging Bertelsmann's successful pay-TV company Premiere with Kirch's digital TV channel DF1.

This strong position would be accentuated by the companies' joint control of BetaResearch with telephone company Deutsche Telekom.

MUNICH, May 8 (Reuters) - German media group Kirch said on Friday it still hopes to reach agreement with
European Union competition authorities on its proposed pay-TV alliance with  Bertelsmann .
"We are talking to the  commission and still hope for an agreement," a Kirch company spokesman told Reuters. The spokesman declined to give details of the talks.
On Thursday, Bertelsmann chief executive Mark Woessner sounded pessimistic on the chances the planned tie-up, which also includes Deutsche Telekom's cable-TV services, would receive EU approval.
Woessner told Reuters he believed the commission would block the deal.
European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert was due to meet today in Berlin with Leo Kirch and
Bertelsmann representatives to try to salvage the plan, EU and industry sources said.

Bertelsmann and Kirch agreed last year to merge their jointly owned pay-TV company Premiere with Kirch's digital pay-TV channel and to use only Kirch's digital decoder technology.

Under these conditions, it seems difficult to believe that the alliance will be approved, except if the companies concerned announce changes to the project, by, notably, admitting other partners into the operation.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The future of the proposed pay-TV alliance between German media groups
Bertelsmann and Kirch is not looking bright, a spokesman for  Bertelsmann said at the weekend.
"We expect the  EU Commission to make a negative decision," Manfred Harnischfeger, head of  Bertelsmann
public relations, told German television.

Previously, Bertelsmann spokesman Helmuth Runde had denied a report in the news magazine Spiegel that the proposed tie-up, which also includes Deutsche Telekom's cable-TV services, had collapsed.

"There is no question of a decision having been reached," he said, adding that the Commission had to make a decision by the beginning of June.
"Until this decision is made, the situation remains open," he said.

However, Harnischfeger said that Bertelsmann could not afford to make any further concessions to make the plan palatable to the EU Commission.

"We have to look at the marketability and the financial viability of the project and these are threatened if we make the wrong kind of compromises," he said.
Spiegel had reported that the alliance had failed following a meeting between both companies and European
Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert.
The two companies did not put forward any new compromise proposals, it said.

BONN, May 10 (AFP) - The German media group  Bertelsmann will make no further concessions to get the European Commission to approve its plan for an alliance with Kirch and is prepared for a "no" from Brussels, a Bertelsmann spokesman said Saturday.
"We are expecting the  European Commission to give a negative ruling," said Manfred Harnsichfeger.

He said a meeting between Leo Kirch, Bertelsmann's financial director Siegfried Luther and the European anti-monopolies commissioner Karel van Miert on Friday had achieved no progress.

"We don't know what new concession we can make. We have run short of imagination. We have to consider the feasability and the viability of the project and this is no longer the case if we make a lot of bad compromises.
In its latest edition due to go on sale Monday, the weekly magazine Der Spiegel said the round table in Berlin on
Friday had failed.

Neither of the two groups would accept further changes to the project and rejected a demand by Van Miert that they cede a majority stake in their joint Beta Research company to an independent third party, Der Spiegel said.

Kirch and Bertelsmann made an agreement on November 8 last year to regroup their digital television operations in a subscriber channel called Premiere.
The European Commission launched an enquiry into the project in January and on Thursday last week, the
European Union's consultative committee turned down the alliance.
The Commission is due to announce its final decision by June 3. lal/jb

FRANKFURT, May 11 (Reuters) - German cable television operators said on Monday they expected the European Commission to block the planned pay-television alliance between German media companies Kirch and Bertelsmann.

"We assume that the deal will fail to be approved," said Jochen Mueller, a spokesman for the ANGA association of private television cable owners.
He said that Kirch and Bertelsmann could not reach an acceptable compromise with the the EU Commission. The EU regulatory body has objected to the current terms of the deal, saying they would create a lasting
monopoly in the digital pay-TV market.
ANGA was one of the parties to file a challenge to the alliance with the commission.

Mueller said ANGA had renewed its offer to Deutsche Telekom , Germany's main cable operator, to discuss cooperation on the construction of the technical platform for digital TV.

The EU Commission is reviewing plans by Kirch, Bertelsmann and Telekom to join forces on the development of digital pay-TV in Germany.

European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert met with representatives of the two media companies on Friday, but a Commission spokesman said that the discussion had been "inconclusive" and that the groups would need to put forward an improved offer. ((Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525,

Bertelsmann-Kirch pay-TV deal appears doomed.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuters) - The  European Commission will block a digital pay-television alliance between Bertelsmann AG and Leo Kirch unless the two German media partners make serious concessions, a commission spokesman said Monday.
The spokesman, Stefan Rating, said that a meeting Friday between  European Competition Commissioner Karel
Van Miert, Leo Kirch and other company representatives had been "inconclusive."

He added the firms must "substantially" improve their offers to address commission concerns that the deal, which also involves telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom, would create a lasting monopoly in the German
pay-TV market.

"The parties know that we cannot take a positive decision as (the deal) stands, meaning on the basis of what they have submitted and the changes they have made to the originally notified agreement," Rating told a news
briefing.

"That means that if there are no further changes which address our remaining concerns we would have no option but to take a negative decision by the deadline of June 3," he said.

Despite intense negotiations in the last two weeks, the two sides are deadlocked over conditions to allow the alliance, under which Bertelsmann and Kirch agreed to bury their past rivalry to get digital TV off the ground.
Many, including Bertelsmann itself, believe the deal is dead.

"We expect the EU Commission to make a negative decision," Manfred Harnischfeger, head of Bertelsmann public relations, told German television on Sunday.

Officials with the association of German cable TV operators, ANGA, which raised strong objections about the deal from the onset, also said Monday they thought the commission would block the deal.
"We assume that the deal will fail to be approved," ANGA's spokesman Jochen Lueller said Monday.

The pay-TV alliance cannot go ahead without the blessing of the commission, the European Union's executive body and clearing house for large mergers and acquisitions.

If the companies fail to win commission's approval - which sometimes happens during 11th-hour talks - it would mark the second time in four years that they have had their pay-TV plans nixed by the European competition watchdog.

Bertelsmann and Kirch already jointly control Germany's only successful analogue pay-TV channel, Premiere, after the withdrawal of France's Canal Plus.

Their strong position would be reinforced by the addition of Kirch's digital pay-TV company DF1 and the vast library of Hollywood films and sports rights owned by the Bavarian media mogul.

The two partners' TV programming power also would be accentuated by their control of Kirch's digital decoder technology and the partnership with Deutsche Telekom, which owns Germany's biggest cable TV network.

Kirch previously offered to sell 25 percent of its film rights and a similar stake in BetaResearch, the subsidiary which has exclusive rights to its digital set-top boxes.

E.U. Commission: No Progress  On Kirch/Bertelsmann Dossier

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Talks Friday between the  European Union Commission and German media groups Kirch Group (G.KCH) and  Bertelsmann AG (G.BRT) were "inconclusive," a Commission spokesman said Monday.

Stefan Rating, spokesman for E.U. competition chief Karel van Miert, said it is now up to the companies to propose acceptable changes to their digital TV joint venture if they want to avoid a  Commission rejection of the venture by the June 3 deadline.
Rating said the companies would probably have to propose something by this week to allow sufficient time for the
Commission bureaucracy to consider any changes.
The Commission contends that the television alliance would smother competition in the emerging digital market if
it were to go ahead as planned. The E.U. competition watchdog is also examining the cable network aspect of the
digital alliance.


Under the proposed link up, Kirch and CLT-UFA would merge their digital TV business and jointly market digital television in Germany using the "d-box" developed by Kirch as their standard decoder for digital TV. They planned to distribute the service via Deutsche Telekom AG's (G.DTL) cable network.

Icy EC warning  on merger deal
632 words
12 May 1998

BRUSSELS, Belgium - The  European Commission issued a stern warning Monday to Germany's KirchGroup and Bertelsmann AG, saying the proposed merger of their pay TV and digital TV services would be blocked by June 3 unless the companies offer drastically revised new proposals.

Monday's announcement came after Kirch and  Bertelsmann submitted compromise proposals offering to sell to competitors parallel-use rights to 25% of the Hollywood output it has secured and to sell off 25% of BetaResearch, the company holding the rights to the access technology for set-top decoders (HR 5/11).

The two corporations will probably have until May 26 to decide whether to walk away or submit a restructured plan in an effort to keep the merger deal alive, since the commission customarily takes it final decision at the last meeting before the June 3 deadline.

The commission's objections now appear to call for such a fundamental restructuring of the deal that it is questionable whether it would still be worthwhile for the companies to go ahead.

"We have to look at the marketability and the financial viability of the project, and these are threatened if we make the wrong kind of compromises," Bertelsmann spokesman Manfred Harnischfeger said on German television.

Commission sources have told The Hollywood Reporter that they feel Kirch-Bertelsmann's Hollywood rights constitute "such a huge competitive advantage," that it is doubtful whether any deal involving them could be "authorizable." The merger involves Luxembourg-based broadcasting company CITUFA's Premiere pay TV channel and Kirch's DF-1 digital service. (Bertelsmann and Belgium's Audiofina are the two main shareholders in CLT-UFA.)

Commission sources said Brussels believes the sale of 25% of the companies' output rights does not free up nearly enough film output to allow any rivals to set up a competitive package.

And the compromise proposal does not even touch on the grip the alliance would have on exclusive sports broadcasting rights.

Asked to comment on German news reports over the weekend that the Premiere deal had collapsed following the latest meeting between the broadcasters and competition commissioner Karel van Miert on Friday in Berlin (HR
5/11), van Mien's spokesman, Stefan Rating, said that meeting had been "inconclusive" and the terms of the alliance were still unnacceptable.

"The parties know we cannot take a positive decision as it (thc proposed merger) stands. If there are no further changes which address our concerns we will have no alternative but to take a negative decision," he said.

Brussels has made it clear throughout the four-month investigation - due to be wrapped up on June 3- it would block the deal on the grounds that it would create a durable monopoly in the German-speaking market.

On May 6 the Advisory Committee of national competition experts endorsed van Miert's negative rccommendation.
Another concern is the spillover effect on conventional, free television programming.

Bertelsmann's Premiere pay TV channel would buy its TV rights independentof the parent broadcasters, making free TV even less competitive.

Then there is the problem of distribution through cable operators. Premiere's latest offer is believed to propose assisting rival cable operators to market the Premiere program package, but that does not in itself solve the threat to competition in the commission's view.

"What you need is something that is common practice in the U.S., the ability to customize or repackage the programming supplied, and that is something that is specifically excluded in the latest offer," said a source familiar with the negotiations.

Similarly, the offer to divest of BetaResearch, intended to be a three-way joint-venture between Kirch, Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom falls short of commission expectations, because the partners would still control the only access technology.

E.U./Deutsche Telekom -2: Unhappy With Switching Fees >G.DTL

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission is to refer its inquiry into  Deutsche Telekom AG's
(G.DTL) fees policy back to German authorities, it said Tuesday.

The Commission decided to open an inquiry into the German phone company's plans to charge its customers for switching to other telecoms suppliers in January.

Its enquiry ran parallel with one conducted by the German national regulatory authority for telecoms in Bonn, provoking criticism from the national body for the apparent lack of cooperation on the issue.

Telekom initially wanted to charge customers between DEM53 and DEM95 for changing operators. However, the national authority rejected the proposal and Telekom reapplied with a reduced fee of DEM49 for switching to another operator, a Commission official said.

Telekom also wants to impose the DEM49 fee on customers that switch their long distance phone calls to another operator, a Commission official said.

This new fee structure would remain in place for two years, after which Telekom would reduce the fee, the official said.

Explaining the Commission's decision to refer the question to the German authorities, the Commission official said: "We are still unhappy with the level of fees Telekom is proposing, but we are confident the national authorities will take the appropriate action."

BRUSSELS, May 13 (Reuters) - The European Union sees progress in new proposals made to Brussels by German media giants Kirch and Bertelsmann for their controversial digital television link-up,  Commission sources said on Wednesday.
The proposals were presented orally to the  Commission on Monday and there was no word on their content but
"they contain progress," one source said.

The two companies must now present written proposals to the European Competition chief Karel van Miert. They are expected to do that by tomorrow at the latest. ((Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230 5573, brussels.newsroom@reuters.com)).

BRUSSELS, May 13 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it had transferred to
Germany's telecoms regulator an investigation into proposed fees  Deutsche Telekom wants to charge customers
for switching networks

"The European Commission has terminated its enquiry into Deutsche Telekom's fees for telecommunications carrier preselection and telephone number portability," the EU executive said in a statement.

It said the move followed a decision by Germany's regulator to block Telekom's initial request for approval for its proposed fees structure.

It noted however Telekom has since made a new submission to the regulator "according to which these fees would remain high in 1998 and 1999."

"Consequently, the Commission has decided to transfer the case to the German authorities for further examination of a possible abuse of dominant position," the Commission said. ((Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287

FOCUS-EU slams Telekom call switching fee.

LBA

(c) 1998 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, May 13 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Wednesday said a revised  Deutsche Telekom
proposal to charge 49 marks ($27.7) to customers switching to rival firms for international calls was still too high.

This was down from Telekom's original plan in December to levy a fee of 95 marks for customers wishing to take advantage of increased competition following the full liberalisation of the German telecommunications market in January.

However, the Commission said it had closed its probe into Telekom's fees, leaving it to the German regulator to examine "a possible abuse of dominant position".

Telekom, which is currently at odds with the country's regulators over cable prices hikes, faced a barrage of criticism at the end of 1997 over plans to penalise customers taking advantage of price competition.

Telekom proposed to charge customers who switch to another operator for long distance calls - a service known as carrier preselection - and impose a sizeable fee on those who chose to defect altogether while keeping their phone number.

The Commission, the European Union's competition watchdog, said in a statement that Telekom's new proposal to charge 49 marks in 1998 and 35 marks in 1999 for carrier preselection "remained high".

The statement said nothing about the proposed level of 20 marks for 2000, but Commission sources suggested this would be fairer price.

The Commission is not against the principle of charging fees for customers who seek to take advantage of price competition between different telecoms operators, but insists the fees involved be cost related.

Information provided to the Commission by 35 telecoms operators "shows that the fees charged by incumbent operators in other (EU) member states, as well as the ones submitted by various German alternative providers, were considerably lower than those of DT," the Commission's statement said.

The statement did not detail the comparisons, but a Commission source said the average charge was "roughly less than half" the 49 marks proposed by Telekom for 1998.

The Commission "trusted the German authorities had the ability" to deal with the issue and "to apply the same strict criteria" as the EU executive, the source said.

Under EU rules, national telecoms regulatory bodies must solve problems arising from the liberalisation of the sector, but the Commission may step in if this is not done in a satisfactory way. ($ = 1.77 marks).

Kirchm,  Bertelsmann to present new pay-TV plan.
By Amelia Torres

BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuters) - German media groups  Bertelsmann AG and Leo Kirch are expected to submit new proposals for a pay-television alliance that could involve Kirch offering to sell off some of its film rights, European Commission sources said Wednesday.

The two companies, which are battling to overcome  commission concerns about how the planned alliance would affect competition in the pay-TV market, may submit their new ideas in writing later Wednesday or on Thursday, the sources said.

Rival broadcasters and cable operators say the companies offered at a series of meetings last week to sell 25 percent of Kirch's film rights as well as to divest 25 percent of its BetaResearch subsidiary.

The commission sources said officials from both companies met European antitrust chief Karel Van Miert at a meeting Monday evening in which further progress was made.
There were no details on the new proposals, but they were widely believed to focus on the extensive rights to
Hollywood films held by Kirch that are essential for the success of rival digital TV platforms.

The commission has objected in the past to the participation in the deal of Deutsche Telekom, which would provide a technical platform to distribute pay-TV over its cable network using decoder technology owned by Kirch's BetaResearch.
The sources said Deutsche Telekom had not made any offers at this stage, nor did the new proposals involve
BetaResearch.

The three companies in December requested European Union approval for their plans to merge Germany's only successful pay-TV company, Premiere, with Kirch's digital TV channel, DF1, and to take joint control of BetaResearch.

The commission started a full-scale probe into both deals in January, expressing concern that the alliance could create a lasting monopoly in the German pay-TV market, and as recently as last weekend Bertelsmann predicted the plan would be blocked.

The commission, which acts as the European Union's executive body and clearinghouse for large mergers and acquisitions, has until June 3 to render its decision.
Although difficult merger probes are often settled in last-minute talks, there was no overriding optimism about the
Bertelsmann-Kirch deal.

"There is very little the companies can do to get the deal through other than parting with a substantial amount of film rights or unless one of the three (firms) is willing to step down from the deal," Gavin Robert, a competition expert with law firm Linklaters & Paines, told Reuters.

DIGITAL TV - BETARESEARCH OWNERSHIP A STUMBLING BLOCK FOR GERMAN MERGER.
491 words
13 May 1998
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 1998 European Report.
The chances of media groups  Bertelsmann and Kirch and their cable operator ally  Deutsche Telekom obtaining EU regulatory clearance for their planned digital television link-up in Germany appeared to be fading fast, after a meeting in Brussels between company management and  EU Competition  Commission Karel Van Miert failed to achieve any progress on May 8. The  Commission feels the concessions offered so far do not go far enough to allay competition concerns, but the partners have dug in their heels on ceding majority ownership over the vital technology. The  EU executive is now expected to finalise a negative Decision on May 27, with a final deadline of June 3.

A Commission spokesman confirmed that the May 8 meeting - at which media magnate Leo Kirch participated in person alongside Bertelsmann Finance Director Siegfried Luther - had ended inconclusively. Bertelsmann Chairman Mark Woessner has already stated publicly that he now expects the Commission to disallow the deal - a double merger which will combine the existing digital pay-TV activities of Kirch and Bertelsmann under the Premiere label and pool ownership of the vital technology three ways - with Deutsche Telekom on board - in a separate company called Betaresearch (for details, see European Report N degrees s 2313, 2301, 2287, 2285 and 2283).

The EU Commissioner for Industry, German national Martin Bangemann, backed by his colleagues Edith Cresson and Marcelino Oreja, are reported to be reluctant to block the deal altogether and have been urging their
colleague in charge of the Competition portfolio, Karel Van Miert, to keep an open mind on the dossier. However, the EU Advisory Committee on Mergers and Acquisitions meeting on May 6 backed the provisional negative
ruling tabled by Mr Van Miert. "We are not against the development of a thriving digital TV industry in Germany, or any other Member State. But our basic job is to ensure that dominant positions are not created through mergers", explained one official.
Opening up the technology.

The Commissioner and his team are thus unwilling to approve a deal which would leave a monopoly over both popular programming content (notable sport and films) and platform/decoder technology in the hands of a single business interest. This focuses attention on Betaresearch. The partners have already offered to sell stakes in the technology company to interested third parties such as television stations ARD and ZDF, and Deutsche Telekom is reportedly prepared to give up its 30% shareholding in Betaresearch in order to ensure fully competitive conditions as regards the digital platform. However, Kirch and Bertelsmann are baulking at surrendering majority control over the technology company, while the TV stations do not see the use of paying for a minority stake which would allow them no say in how the business is run. On May 10, a Bertelsmann spokesman insisted the company was not prepared to make any further concessions to Commission concerns.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS - COMMISSION LEAVES DEUTSCHE TELEKOM CHARGES CASE IN GERMAN HANDS.
431 words
13 May 1998
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 1998 European Report.
The European Commission has decided to close its own investigation into fees which German telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom (DT) was planning to charge customers for the right to pre-select an alternative telephony carrier or to carry off their existing phone numbers when they jilt DT and will leave the matter in the hands of the German telecoms regulator.  EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert and his team now feel confident that the new German Telecoms Regulatory Authority, which only began work last year, is firmly in the saddle and able to cope with the sensitive case at a purely national level.
A bad example?

The EU competition watchdog opened an inquiry in January under Article 86 of the EC Treaty - which outlaws abuses of dominant market position - after Deutsche Telekom announced charges of DM 95 (ECU 48) for carrier preselection and DM 53 (ECU 27) for number portability from January 1, 1998 (see European Report Number
2281). Such fees - which prima facie appeared excessive - were not only likely to constitute a barrier to market entry for other operators in Germany, but also to serve as a bad example for dominant incumbent telecoms operators across the Community to abuse their positions in the newly-liberalised environment, feared Karel Van Miert.
Europe-wide survey.

Consequently, it was important for the Commission to be able to make an international comparison and verify whether the German tariffs impaired effective competition in the EU. Information requests were sent out on January 9 to 35 telecommunications operators throughout Europe, asking the them to detail the terms and conditions of carrier pre-selection and number portability, especially the fees charged for these services. An analysis of the replies showed that the fees charged by incumbent operators in other EU Member States, as well as the ones submitted by alternative German providers, were considerably lower than those announced by DT.
German refusal.

Meanwhile the fledging German regulator has showed its mettle by rejecting DT's application to charge a reduced fee of DM 49 (including VAT) from April 7, 1998 for number portability. The German watchdog has still not
reached a final decision on the proposed preselectivity fee. DT has recently proposed a series of gradually diminishing charges from DM 49 in 1998 to DM 35 in 1999 and down to DM 20 from the year 2000 onwards. The Commission therefore decided on May 12 to leave to Bonn the task of ensuring that DT does not overstep the mark in its home market.

European Commission To Block  Bertelsmann/Kirch Pay-TV Deal
Sylvia Dennis, Newsbytes
574 words
13 May 1998
Newsbytes News Network
NBYT

(c) 1998 Newsbytes News Network
BRUSSELS, BELGIUM, 1998 MAY 13 (NB). The European Commission (EC) has revealed that it will almost certainly block a proposed digital pay-TV alliance Bertelsmann and Leo Kirch, unless the two German firms make some serious concessions.

The somber news comes against a backdrop of the failure of digital pay-TV broadcasting to take off in Germany in anywhere near the sort of numbers that experts were predicting only 12 to 18 months ago, Newsbytes notes.
EC officials said a key meeting held last Friday between all parties failed to produce anything constructive. According to Stefan Rating, a spokesperson for EC Competition Minister Karel van Miert's office, all the parties,
which Newsbytes understands to include Deutsche Telekom, must agree to certain conditions before a linkup
deal will be officially approved.

"The parties know that we cannot take a positive decision as the deal stands, meaning on the basis of what they have submitted and the changes they have made to the originally notified agreement," Rating told journalists at a press briefing earlier this week.

"That means that, if there are no further changes which address our remaining concerns, we would have no option but to take a negative decision by the deadline of June 3," he said.

Both Kirch and Bertelsmann have their own digital pay-TV operations in the planning stages in Germany, Newsbytes notes, but the two firms want to merge their operations to reduce operating costs. Deutsche Telekom is also interested in coming on board, something that would create a monopoly in German pay-TV, hence the serious intervention by the EC.

Newsbytes notes that Bertelsmann may not be helping itself, as Manfred Harnischfeger, head of the firm's PR operations, appeared on German TV over the weekend, noting the EC's stance. "We expect the EU Commission to make a negative decision," he told a reporter.

Along with the EC, cable TV/phone operators in Germany are known to be against a linkup deal. Without EC approval, a big question mark hangs over the future of Premiere, the German film channel, which is jointly operated by Bertelsmann and Kirch.

If EC approval is forthcoming, Kirch would offer a wide range of digital programming in Germany, backed by DF1, the firm's digital firm, and supported by Bertelsmann's library of films and sports viewing rights.

As reported last December by Newsbytes, Bertelsmann and Kirch announced that Premiere's marketing budget was frozen until further notice. The companies have continued to sell subscriptions to the service, Newsbytes understands, but the service will not be advertised.

As reported by Newsbytes in March of last year, the UK's BSkyB operation dumped plans to merge its operations with Kirch in Germany "because of a failure to agree a number of fundamental issues."

BSkyB has previously announced plans to take a 49 percent stake in DF1, Kirch's German digital television service, in the summer of 1996, but nothing further was heard until March of last year.

In March 1997, Newsbytes reported that Industry experts had suggested that the plan foundered on the twin problems of lack of interest in digital satellite TV in Europe, plus BSkyB's stake in the Premiere digital venture.

Kirch, Bertelsmann in offer to cable TV firms.

BRUSSELS, May 14 (Reuters) - German media groups Kirch and  Bertelsmann AG have offered to let cable television operators other than  Deutsche Telekom market their digital TV platform, Premiere, to win  EU approval for their alliance.
The offer was contained in a letter to the  European Commission, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert declined on Thursday to comment on the latest proposal
made by Bertelsmann and Bavarian media mogul Leo Kirch, saying he received the letter only on Wednesday.

"I'm waiting for the assessment from my services," Van Miert told Reuters in Strasbourg where he was attending a regular meeting of the European Parliament.

But according to one of the cable companies, the letter went a long way to meeting the concern of rival cable companies that they would be excluded altogether from the powerful Germany pay-TV alliance.

"If they were ready to make some more efforts it could be...that the problem is solved as far as the cable operators are concerned," the cable source told Reuters.

German cable operators and TV broadcasters have led the fight against the proposed television alliance between Bertelsmann, Kirch and Telekom, which the Commission has threatened to block if competition concerns are not met.
The source said some of the conditions attached to the latest offer were unacceptable.

As an example, he cited a clause forcing the cable companies to use set-top decoder boxes owned by Leo Kirch until he was able to rid himself of one million Nokia boxes bought for a high price three years ago. Only after that would they be able to use other decoder boxes.

More importantly, rival cable firms wanted to be paid for delivering the service to homes, something that was far from guaranteed in the letter, dated May 12.

Kirch and Bertelsmann have insisted that they should be the ones to bill the service to German-speaking households, which include Austria and part of Switzerland.

Public broadcasters were also expected to seek more concessions and time is running out for the alliance partners because the Commission must rule on the deal by June 3.

The letter also detailed an offer made last week to sell 25 percent of Kirch's rights to Hollywood films, which are essential for a successful TV channel, but did not substantially improve on that proposal.

It also pledged to sell 25 percent of BetaResearch, the company that owns exclusive rights to Kirch's decoder technology. However, both rival broadcasters and cable operators demand that this company be put in neutral hands.

The Commission's merger task-force, which prepares decisions for the EU executive, is expected to draft a final decision next week, which could be submitted to the full college on May 27.

Media giant fights  to save pay-TV deal.

GERMAN media mogul Leo Kirch is set to push for further talks with the European Commission in the hope of thrashing out a last-minute deal to win anti-trust clearance for his digital pay-TV alliance with the Bertelsmann group.

Kirch's pledge to fight on follows the breakdown of talks with Competition  Commission Karel van Miert in Berlin last week.

Sources said the companies would call on the Commission to reopen the negotiating process and did not rule out further concessions in a bid to win approval before the Commission's 3 June deadline for a decision.

"We want to come together with the Commission to find an agreement. I can't talk right now about further concessions. We have to do that exclusively with the Commission, as in the past," said one Kirch insider. "It is unlikely that we will get any deal this week, but we would not rule something out towards the end of this month."

Kirch also denies any rift with partner Bertelsmann, after an apparently defeatist chairman Mark Woessner stated publicly that he thought the Commission was going to reject the alliance on the grounds that it would create a powerful digital TV monopoly in Germany.

"We have said we share their view about the situation. But Kirch Group does not resign so fast. That's not how we came to be successful," said one source at the Bavarian media giant's headquarters, although he added: "I do not want to make jokes about the situation we are in. It is difficult, but it's not impossible."

Under the terms of the alliance announced last summer, long-time media enemies Kirch and Bertelsmann agreed to merge their jointly-owned pay-TV venture Premiere with Kirch's digital pay-TV channel DF1 and to use only Kirch's digital decoder technology.
The Commission strongly opposed the alliance, saying it would create a lasting monopoly.

The proposed deal also attracted fierce criticism from all sides of the German media spectrum, including private cable TV operators and public service broadcasters who share Van Miert's concern that the move would jeopardise their own plans for free digital TV services.

"We fear the combination of Bertelsmann and Kirch's pay-TV services would inevitably lead to a situation where free TV will become less and less attractive and those viewers who are not willing or able to pay will lose out," complained public broadcaster ARD in a statement.

In response to Commission and industry warnings, Kirch offered to sell 25% of its Hollywood 'output' film rights along with a 25% share in BetaResearch, which owns the rights to the digital decoder technology behind the venture.

The alliance partners also promised to make the decoder technology accessible to other television companies, although rival firms complain that the system is not as sophisticated as other platforms and puts its owners in a dominant 'gate-keeper' position since it is approved by Deutsche Telekom, which owns the country's largest cable TV network.

These concessions were not enough to convince a committee of competition experts from the EU's 15 member states, which last week recommended that the Commission block the venture.
Despite Kirch's calls for further talks, a spokesman for Van Miert warned that
Page 60 of 124 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the Commission would not bend over backwards to bring the sides together to force a deal before the 3 June deadline.

He said there were no new plans for talks with the companies, and insisted that the ball was now firmly in their court.

"We have made our objections clear. If the companies decide that it is appropriate to make further changes, then it's up to them. We are dealing with the merger regulations and they are quite strict. Either a merger enhances a dominant position or it doesn't," he said. "It is not like an Article 85 anti-trust inquiry that can go on for ages and where the Commission takes into account all kinds of factors."

The Bertelsmann SA-Kirch Gruppe digital pay-TV joint venture, DF1, now looks as if it will be cleared by the  EC competition authorities. However, the companies involved have had to make further unspecified concessions to get the venture past the previously openly hostile  commission. The breakthrough was made in negotiations last Tuesday. CLT (Ufa), the television company in which Kirch has a 50 percent stake, revealed that concessions had been made but made no further comment. These concessions are in addition to  Bertelsmann-Kirch consortium agreeing to give up the broadcast rights to 25 percent of its Hollywood sourced output to other broadcasters and offering to sell off 25 percent of decoder makers, Beta Research.

COMMISSION TERMINATES PROCEDURE AGAINST  DEUTSCHE TELEKOM'S FEES FOR PRESELECTION AND NUMBER PORTABILITY AND TRANSFERS THE CASE TO GERMAN AUTHORITIES.
Brussels, 14/05/1998 (Agence  Europe) - The European Commission has terminated its enquiry into  Deutsche
Telekom's practices in two areas:

- carrier preselection, i.e. the right for a customer to switch to another operator for long distance calls while remaining with the incumbent operator for local calls and keeping his original phone number;

- number portability, i.e. the right for a customer to switch to another operator for all phone calls while keeping his original phone number.

The Commission had opened a procedure for abuse of dominant position (Article 86 of the Treaty) last December, further to Deutsche Telekom's announcement of the amount of the amount it planned to charge from early-1998: DM 95 for preselection, DM 53 for portability. The Commission carried out an investigation in other Member States, noting that the fees demanded elsewhere were much lower. However, last month the German "regulator" (responsible for monitoring the national telecoms market) rejected the request regarding portability fees (even though the company announced its intention of dropping them to DM 49 with effect from 1 April 1998), and Deutsche Telekom itself withdrew its request relating to preselection fees. This is why the Commission considered that its enquiry had no reason to continue and closed it.

At the same time, however, the company lodged another request with the national "regulator" to obtain approval for its preselection fees, with a downward spiral: DM 49 for 1998, DM 35 for 1999 and DM 20 from 2000 on. The Commission observed that it was up to the German authorities to decide on whether there was abuse of dominant position, and handed the issue back to them.

Not Available for Re-dissemination.
The latest concessions from German digital pay-TV partners Leo Kirch and CLT-Ufa will not be enough to save the proposed alliance from a  European Commission (EC) veto, according to an  EC spokesman.

The spokesman confirmed on Monday (11 May) that the commission will block the proposed German digital alliance - between Kirch,  Bertelsmann-backed CLT-Ufa and Deutsche Telekom (DT) - on anti-competitive grounds unless further 'substantial' concessions are forthcoming by the 3 June deadline for a final ruling.

The spokesman said: 'The parties know that we cannot take a positive decision as (the deal) stands. If there are no further changes which address our remaining concerns, we would have no option but to take a negative decision by the deadline of 3 June.'
The spokesman added that a meeting in Berlin on Friday (8 May) between competition commissioner Karel Van
Miert and executives from Kirch and CLT-Ufa had been 'inconclusive'.

The meeting was called after the EC last week rejected a revised Kirch/CLT-Ufa digital merger plan, with concessions including an offer by Kirch to sell 25 per cent of its pay-TV film rights to third parties.
The original plan involved a merger between Kirch's DF1 digital platform and CLT-Ufa's Premiere channel. The EC is concerned that the proposed merger, along with the tie-up with DT, would give the partners a
monopoly of the German digital pay-TV market.

GERMAN DIGITAL TV ALLIANCE PARTNERS IN LAST-DITCH BID FOR EU APPROVAL.
325 words
16 May 1998
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 1998 European Report.
A dramatic turnaround in the  European Commission's ongoing investigation into the proposed German digital
TV alliance came on May 13, with the announcement that media groups  Bertelsmann and Kirch had modified the
terms of their deal in a late bid to secure approval under  EU Merger Regulation procedures. The modified
proposal, which EU sources indicated "covers all points at issue", was described by the same sources as
"promising". German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported that the partners had now agreed to allow rival cable
distribution companies to offer Premiere - the digital channel which would be jointly operated by  Bertelsmann
and Kirch using the latter's set-top box technology - directly to their own customers. This would help to ensure
competition between digital television providers and ensure that the two partners do not create an unchallengable
monopoly in the sector.
The new draft of the merger proposal has now been sent out to interested third parties and the members of the
EU Advisory Committee for their comments.

The turnaround came at a hurriedly-convened meeting in Brussels late on May 12 between EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert and Leo Kirch and Michael Dornemann representing the two companies. A few hours earlier, the partners had still been insisting they would make no further changes to their deal to secure approval. At the meeting, Messrs Kirch and Dornemann rejected the idea of withdrawing their proposals and substituting new ones, but made verbal offers which were then submitted in written form on May 14. No representative of Deutsche Telekom was present and the issue of the ownership of the technology company Betaresearch was not discussed, sources indicate. Betaresearch is the subject of a second merger inquiry (see last issue of European Report), which the EU competition watchdog is hoping to finalise in parallel with the Premiere decision before the June 3 deadline.

O.Tel.O Offers Digital TV Plan To E.U. - Reports

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--O.Tel.O., the telecommunications unit of Veba AG (G.VEB) and RWE AG (G.RWE), has proposed to the  European Union Commission a consortium to offer digital television in Germany in a bid that rivals efforts by German media giants Kirch Group (G.KCH) and  Bertelsmann AG (G.BRT), according to weekend newspaper reports.
The Cologne-based O.Tel.O proposes organizing a consortium of regional cable network providers to offer digital
TV services in cooperation with  Deutsche Telekom (G.DTL), German daily Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung
reported Saturday. This solution would maintain competition between cable network providers and program
suppliers, who could still offer their own packages, according to the report.
O.Tel.O officials weren't immediately available for comment during the weekend.
Kirch Group and Bertelsmann affiliate CLT-UFA have proposed offering digital television over the cable TV
network of Germany's former phone monopoly, Deutsche Telekom, to homes with special "d-box" decoders.
The E.U. Commission's anti-trust authorities are to decide by next month whether to approve the proposed digital
TV alliance between Kirch and Bertelsmann.

KIRCH, BERTELSMANN TO MAKE FURTHER CONCESSIONS
542 words
18 May 1998

German media giants Kirch and  Bertelsmann are expected to make further concessions in a last-minute attempt to save their planned digital TV joint venture and merger of pay-TV services Premiere and DF1 from being blocked by the European Commission.

According to sources at the  Commission, proposals such as the sale of 25 per cent of Kirch's movie rights were "not enough" to alleviate its fears about the creation of a dominant position in the German-speaking pay-TV market.

"We were looking at a major concession such as the total withdrawal from the sports market, which is suffering from concentration anyway," said one official.

The Commission's competition department unanimously proposed to ban the deal in a preliminary draft decision at the merger advisory committee meeting May 6. The final ruling is expected sometime in early June, but the EU Commission usually follows the advisory's recommendations.

According to Commission sources, Kirch and Bertelsmann officials submitted written proposals that would open the digital TV market to competition. A letter sent by Kirch is said to have agreed to allow Germany's cable TV operators - Deutsche Telekom - market Premiere, one of the main sticking points at which the cable industry balked.

Under the terms of the deal, Deutsche Telekom and CLT-UfA also would share control in BetaResearch with Kirch. BetaResearch, a 100- per cent subsidiary of Kirch, owns exclusive licenses for the d-box set-top decoder boxes. Kirch apparently is willing to sell 25 per cent of BetaResearch.

The letter, however, did not agree to all of the cable operators' demands. Kirch and Bertelsmann feel that the cable operators demand of cash for delivering the service was unrealistic.

Kirch earlier said the DF1 service would be scrapped should the deal fall through. Meanwhile, Bertelsmann officials openly are discussing the future of digital TV "after Brussels." If the merger is banned, they will conduct a major review of all digital TV plans and even is reported to be considering dropping digital plans for Premiere. If this happens, Germany could in effect become a digital- free zone.

At the same time, reports are surfacing of financial difficulties at Kirch Group, which is said to be looking for a major credit extension to cover mounting costs. Bertelsmann has estimated Kirch's total liabilities at between DM7 billion ($4 billion) and DM8 billion ($4.5 billion) and his current account shortfall at about DM1 billion ($562
million).

Kirch's head of finances, Herbert Schroder, claimed last November: "Our negotiations with the major banks have become very difficult as a result of political moves against us and the continuing investigation into tax-evasion in Germany and Switzerland."

DF1 manager Gotfried Zmeck also stated at the same time: OWe are the target of a well-organised campaign to discredit the company at all costs. You can well-imagine where this is coming from, who is behind all this. These people have powerful friends."

Kirch is said to be offering his stock in Springer Verlag (35 per cent plus one share), as well as his films, as security. He has been able to obtain a short-term credit from Swiss businessman Guenter Kiss for DM200 million ($112.5 million).

TELEKOM FACES CABLE SELL-OFF

(c) 1998 Phillips Business Information, Inc.
Deutsche Telekom may be forced to sell off its 20 million subscriber cable system at a loss following moves by the German government and the  European Commission.

Telekom's system only allows for 28 analogue channels in most parts of Germany, plus some 150 digital channels using the so-called hyperband. There is no return capacity that allows for cable modems or any other kind of high-speed interactivity by the customer.

Telekom is refusing to invest in new capacity, claiming that it is already loosing about DM1 billion ($562 million) a year on its cable operation. The German government largely has banned an intended price rise by Telekom for cable, stating that it had loaded its cable operations with costs incurred elsewhere.

This state of affairs has caused several potential competitors to file a series of complaints with European Commissioner Karel van Miert. Broadcasters also have complained about the rising cost of using Telekom's system, pointing out that in the United States cable operators pay the programme suppliers.

RTL manager Helmut Thoma said, "Whenever one deals with Deutsche Telekom, the laws of physics and economics seem to have somehow miraculously changed."

Private cable and telephone operator o.tel.o (subsidiary of the power companies RWE and Veba) claims Telekom's cable system could be operated at a profit if it were modernised. Part of any such modernisation would include internet and telephone services via cable.
Commissioner van Miert is said to favour a forced separation of cable and telephone by insisting that Telekom
sell. Although in the past Telekom chairman Ron Sommer turned down any idea of a sell- off, Gerd Tenzer, board
member responsible for multimedia, admitted Telekom has had to adjust its books to create the massive DM4.5
billion ($2.5 billion) reserve to accommodate a forced sale. This is, he told journalists, the amount that Telekom
would loose.

In the event of a sale, staff would have the choice of changing employers and loosing their security of tenure, or staying with Telekom, which would then be in the difficult position of having to find new jobs for staff that it does not really want. It already employs no less than 240,000 and is trying to persuade as many as possible to take early retirement. Pension commitments are already said to be a major headache.

CLT-UFA -3:E.U. Decision  Won't Hinder Premiere Development

CLT-UFA said it would commit a major part of its 1998 investment to the digital development of German pay-TV channel Premiere, which is jointly owned by CLT-UFA's German parent  Bertelsmann and fellow German broadcaster Kirch Group (G.KCH).

It also said it would continue to invest in Premiere, even if the  European Union Commission rules against a digital alliance between  Bertelsmann and Kirch.

"CLT-UFA will be sticking to its goal, irrespective of the European Commission's decision, to secure Premiere's development on a long term basis and to expand the nucleus of German pay-TV," the company said.
The Commission is expected to decide on the Kirch/Bertelsmann dossier next Wednesday.
The Commission contends that the television alliance would smother competition in the emerging digital market if
it were to go ahead as planned. The E.U. competition watchdog is also examining the cable network aspect of the
digital alliance.

Under the proposed link up, Kirch and CLT-UFA would merge their digital TV business and jointly market digital television in Germany using the "D-box" developed by Kirch as their standard decoder for digital TV. They had planned to distribute the service via Deutsche Telekom AG's (G.DTL) cable network.


However, a Commission official said Kirch and Bertelsmann have offered to drop the Deutsche Telekom distribution link to get their alliance approved.

LUXEMBOURG, May 19 (Reuters) - CLT-UFA president and chief executive Rolf Schmidt-Holtz said on Tuesday he expected the  European Commission to block a proposed a pay-TV deal linking  Bertelsmann and Leo Kirch.

He told Reuters the German partners would hold talks with  European Competition Commissioner karel Van Miert later on Tuesday.
"I fear he'll give us a clear no, in which case we'll have to expand (German pay-TV channel) Premiere."

"We can't go further than that (what has already been proposed)," he said, adding that pressure from the German market would prevent any further concessions to the Commission.

CLT-UFA, a television joint venture between Bertelsmann and Audiofina and Europe's largest commercial broadcasting group, said earlier it remained committed to digital television in Germany, irrespective of any Commission decision on the planned deal between Bertelsmann AG and media tycoon Kirch.

The Commission, fearing the creation of a dominant force in the German-speaking pay-TV market, is due to decide whether the planned Bertelsmann/Kirch alliance should be blocked.

Bertelsmann wants to merge Premiere, Germany's only successful pay-TV company, with Kirch's ailing DF1 digital TV channel.

The Commission, acting as the European Union's antitrust watchdog, has asked the companies to review the deal and come up with changes. ((Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230 5573, brussels.newsroom@reuters.com)).

BRUSSELS, May 20 (Reuters) -  European Commission anti-trust chief Karel Van Miert said on Wednesday there had been "some progress" in talks Tuesday aimed at salvaging Germany's digital television deal involving media groups Kirch and  Bertelsmann and telecoms firm  Deutsche Telekom .
Van Miert told a news conference however that time was running out to find a compromise that would allow the
Commission to clear the deal, but predicted more talks ahead of a key advisory meeting next week.
"Presumably something new will come, but if this is sufficient, I do not know," Van Miert said, adding that
Tuesday's talks had failed to find the global agreement that would be necessary for the EU to clear the alliance.

"I'm not saying no progress has been made, that would not be fair. There has been some progress," Van Miert said, adding Telekom had "come up with helpful suggestions".
He did not elaborate.

Van Miert said however there was "very little time (left) to try and attempt to find a defensible way out and create the proper conditions (for fair competition)."

He said the EU's advisory committee on mergers, made up of national anti-trust officials, was due to look again at the case and the latest offers by the companies next Monday. ((Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- German media companies Kirch Group and Bertelsmann AG have "made progress" in their quest for approval of a digital-television venture, but time is running short, European Union competition chief Karel Van Miert said Wednesday.

Van Miert said Kirch and  Bertelsmann "need to hurry" if they want to beat a June 3 deadline on the  EU               Commission's investigation of the venture.

"A lot of time has been lost," the competition commissioner said. "There's very little time to find a defensible way out, to create proper conditions."

Effectively, the companies have to come up with a workable solution by Monday, when commission technical experts gather to analyze any proposals, Van Miert indicated.

The commission has said in the past that the television alliance would smother competition in the emerging digital market if it were to go ahead as planned. The EU competition watchdog is also examining the cable network aspect of the digital alliance.

Under the planned venture, CLT-Ufa and Kirch would take joint control of Premiere, Germany's leading pay-TV channel, and Kirch's existing digital pay-TV service, DF1, would be merged into Premiere. The companies would use Kirch's "d-box" decoder as the set-top box to receive digital TV signals. In addition, the companies have agreed to distribute programs over Deutsche Telekom AG's vast cable network through another company known as BetaResearch.

Wednesday's Wall Street Journal Europe reported that CLT-Ufa executives have vowed not to make any last-minute concessions to win EU approval and would instead expand Premiere.
Van Miert said Telekom has made proposals that have improved the venture's chances of winning the green light. Rolf Schmidt-Holtz, president and chief executive officer of CLT-Ufa, told the Journal the final offer to the
commission involved shedding a 25% stake in BetaResearch, selling 25% of Kirch's film rights and allowing other
cable companies to market the digital-television service.

For his part, the commissioner was expected to press for guarantees that cable companies will be allowed to market the digital venture on their own terms. Commission officials have also said that Van Miert was seeking a
50% reduction in the BetaResearch holding. The commission in 1994 blocked a cable and pay-TV venture involving Kirch, Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom.

BERTELSMANN AND KIRCH PROPOSE LAST MINUTE CONCESSIONS GERMANY: PARTNERS AGREE TO ALLOW CABLE OPERATORS TO TAKE OVER MARKETING

The chances for the planned pay-TV alliance between German media companies  Bertelsmann/CLT-UFA and Kirch-Group to receive the green light from Brussels became marginally better after the two partners proposed further concessions to the  European Commission last week. In response to demands from  EU Commissioner Karel van Miert to give the private cable companies more freedom in the marketing of the channels that are using the alliance's digital platform,  Bertelsmann and Kirch have agreed to allow the cable companies to take over the marketing of their jointly owned pay-TV channel Premiere and its digital bouquet. The cable companies would be able to bundle Premiere's offering with independent thematic channels and create a completely new package for their subscribers.
Also, Bertelsmann and Kirch have agreed to allow the cable companies to manage the sale or rental of digital
set-top- boxes, but only under the condition that the one million decoders ordered by Kirch-Group from Nokia are
disseminated in the market first. Then, decoders manufactured by other companies can be offered to subscribers.
According to sources at the EC the new proposals are seen as positive progress.

After the competition advisors from 15 European states on May 6 had unanimously recommended to the 20 members of the Brussels authority a ban of the companies' plans, the chances for the alliance were thought to be smaller than ever. Even a last-minute proposal by Bertelsmann and Kirch to sell 25 per cent of the movie rights they bought in Hollywood to competitors couldn't convince the European watchdogs, as reported by our sister publication Cable Europe. Bertelsmann and Kirch want to merge their pay-TV networks DF1 and Premiere into a joint offering. Kirch has already announced the closure of its loss-making digital pay-TV bouquet DF1 even if the EU Commission says "no" to the merger plans.

Bertelsmann Unit Sticks to Guns On TV Venture

LUXEMBOURG -- Executives from Bertelsmann AG's television arm, CLT-UFa, vowed not to make any
last-minute concessions to win EuropeanCommission approval for their planned digital-television venture with
Kirch Group.

But the executives said CLT-Ufa, which posted a net loss of 2.9 billion Luxembourg francs ($79 million) last year, would stick with the Premiere pay-TV venture even if the  commission rejects it under its current form. "I fear he (Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert) will give us a `no,' in which case we'll have to expand Premiere," said Rolf Schmidt-Holtz, president and chief executive officer of CLT-Ufa.

His comments came as Bertelsmann and Kirch prepared for last-ditch talks with Mr. Van Miert in Brussels in an effort to convince the commissioner to clear the venture. The commission repeatedly has threatened to block the link-up because of concerns that it will stifle competition in Germany's fledgling digital-TV market. Commission officials, however, reported some progress in meetings with the companies last week. The European Union's antitrust watchdog has until June 3 to rule on the matter, but is expected to issue its decision on May 27. "We believe we have bent over backwards . . . but we can't go further," Mr. Schmidt-Holtz said of the negotiations with the commission. He said that additional changes would mean the venture is no longer a "reasonable economic plan."

Under the planned venture, CLT-Ufa and Kirch would take joint control of Premiere, Germany's leading pay-TV channel, and Kirch's existing digital pay-TV service, DF1, would be merged into Premiere. In addition, the companies have agreed to distribute programs over Deutsche Telekom AG's vast cable network through another company known as BetaResearch.
Mr. Schmidt-Holtz said the final offer to the commission involved shedding a 25% stake in BetaResearch, selling
25% of Kirch's film rights and allowing other cable companies to market the digital-television service. Michael
Dornemann, Bertelsmann's head of entertainment, said he would be discussing the "implementation" of the
proposals with the commission Tuesday evening. "I am hoping for a `yes' on the basis of what we have offered,"
Mr. Dornemann said as he headed for the meeting with Mr. Van Miert.

For his part, the commissioner was expected to press for guarantees that cable companies will be allowed to market the digital venture on their own terms. Commission officials have also said that Mr. Van Miert was seeking a 50% reduction in the BetaResearch holding. The commission in 1994 blocked a cable and pay-TV venture involving Kirch, Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom.

DIGITAL TV - PROGRESS WITH DEUTSCHE TELEKOM ON GERMAN ALLIANCE.
622 words
21 May 1998
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 1998 European Report.
European Commission competition officials have been making "substantial progress" with the three German companies planning to set up digital television joint ventures, Commissioner Karel Van Miert told the Brussels press corps on May 20. A three-hour meeting in Brussels with media firms  Bertelsmann and Kirch and their ally Deutsche Telekom on May 19 allowed the negotiations to move forward on the key question of ownership of the technology to be used in encoding, distributing and descrambling the digital pay-TV signals, the Commissioner indicated. However, the German cartel office has expressed the view that plans by  Deutsche Telekom to decentralise its cable network will not significantly remedy competition problems thrown up by the deal unless the partners allow rival distributors to unbundle the Premiere digital TV package.
Opening up Betaresearch.

Karel Van Miert explained that the Commission-Kirch-Bertelsmann-Deutsche Telekom meeting on May 19 had produced real progress in the partners' aim to secure regulatory approval for their two linked mergers (for full details of the double merger deal, see European Report N degrees s 2315, 2313, 2301, 2287 and 2283). Rivals have claimed that if the partners retain full control of Betaresearch, the company which will develop and manage the technical platform, they will be in a position to maintain an anti-competitive stranglehold on digital TV distribution in Germany. Deutsche Telekom, originally slated to take a one-third share in the technology joint venture, has now signalled its willingness to make way for other companies - such as national TV stations - to take a significant stake.
However, Mr Van Miert warned that the allies would have to move quickly on the outstanding issues if they
wanted to secure authorisation by the June 3 deadline. The EU Advisory Committee on Mergers and Acquisitions
is to meet again on May 25 to discuss the latest concessions made by Kirch and Bertelsmann. The Commission's
current position is that the mergers cannot be approved in their currently-proposed form.
New cable market model?

Meanwhile moves to restructure the entire German cable distribution sector may have a significant bearing on the digital TV deal. The weekly Welt am Sonntag reported on May 17 that the DT board will shortly finalise a decision leading to a complete decentralisation of the running of its cable network, which reaches some 17m homes in the Federal Republic. At the same time, rival telecoms/cable provider o.tel.o (a joint venture set up by German energy groups Veba and RWE) has recommended to the European Commission a revolutionary "alternative market model" for the German cable sector. The plan would involve pooling all cable interests - those of DT plus 6,000 smaller operators - in a single consortium, which would then be organised on a regional basis to allow competition between programme providers across the nation. The EU competition watchdog has consistently expressed its opposition to powerful telecoms companies controlling cable distribution as well.

The new cable landscape would then change the nature of the way Kirch-Bertelsmann's Premiere digital TV package would be distributed. The regional cable firms would be allowed to offer Premiere alongside their own programme range, while Premiere could also be sold directly to end customers - in all cases using the d-box set-top decoder developed by Kirch, to be run by Betaresearch.

However, officials at the German monopolies office the Bundeskartellamt have categorically stated their opposition to the deal in its current form. One important stumbling block is the fact that cable firms subscribing to the Premiere package would not - under current proposals - be entitled to unbundle and re-package the content, explained a BKA spokesman on May 18.

EC czar: Digital merger nearing oblivion stage Competition commissioner warns this co and Bertelsmann to find way out before commission blocks  proposed merger of digital  svcs

BRUSSELS, Belgium --  European competition commissioner Karel van Miert on Wednesday warned that time is running out for German digital pay TV partners KirchGroup and  Bertelsmann AG to "find a defensible way out" before the  commission blocks the proposed merger of their digital services next week.

Van Miert said that he held a three-hour meeting Tuesday night with a "very large delegation" that included Rolf Schmidt- Holtz, president and CEO of CLT- UFA, and Bertelsmann executives in Brussels. (Luxembourg- based CLT-UFA is Europe's largest broadcaster, combining the TV interests of Bertelsmann and Belgium's Audiofina.)

Earlier Tuesday, Schmidt-Holtz had ruled out any further concessions to the competition commission's concerns about dominance in the German-speaking market.

The commissioner said that although "some progress" had been made, "there was no global agreement," at the meeting.

"There is very little time remaining to find a defensible way out and create the proper conditions (to ensure fair competition) ," the commissioner said.

The commissioner's senior officials, known as "chefs de cabinet," met Wednesday to agree to the ruling on the case and put it on the agenda for a formal decision next Wednesday, in time for the dead- line of June 3.

On Monday, the advisory committee of national competition experts, who have already endorsed van Miert's decision, will convene,
However, an official said both decisions "can always be changed" if there are any significant last-minute offers.

* The commissioner seemed to be going out of his way to give the German broadcasters a last chance to save their alliance, although he did not shy away from criticizing them for taking three weeks to offer modifications after commission hearings. He called attention to the companies' "very complicated way of working" in requesting negotiations hours after publicly stating no new proposals would be forthcoming.

The commission is now formally closed until Monday to celebrate Pentecost, but van Miert indicated that he expected talks to continue.

Kirch-Bertelsmann have so far offered to sell 25% of their film rights to competitors and to make their joint service available to other cable operators. In addition, they proposed to sell 25% of BetaResearch, the company holding the rights to decoder technology (HR 5/19). Bertelsmann has warned that the alliance would not be commercially viable if they gave up any more concessions.

Bertelsmann, Kirch detail proposals to EU.

BRUSSELS, May 22 (Reuters) - German media groups  Bertelsmann AG and Kirch have given the  European     Commission details of their compromise proposals to salvage their planned digital television project, according
to a letter obtained by Reuters on Friday.

The 27-page letter contains little new information but fleshes out proposals previously made to the  Commission, which is reviewing the companies' plans to merge their jointly held pay-television group Premiere with Kirch's digital pay TV channel DF1.
The deal includes cooperation with phone giant Deutsche Telekom AG . The letter was to European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert.
Bowing to pressure from the Commission, Bertelsmann and Kirch have offered to make concessions, but Germany's Federal Cartel Office and rival cable TV operator Otelo Communications have voiced strong opposition to the deal.

The letter from Kirch and Bertelsmann repeats a pledge to let private cable companies market Premiere, but says the names of clients won by the cable operators should be available to Premiere.
Private cable operators in Germany are fiercely opposed to this proposal.
Kirch and Bertelsmann also said in the letter that cable operators must use the one million decoders made by
Finnish company Nokia that have already been bought by Premiere until this stock is gone.
The letter put in writing proposals the two companies had previously made in talks with the Commission.

Van Miert said on Wednesday that there had been "some progress" in talks the previous day, but said time was running out to find a compromise that would allow the Commission to clear the deal.

The EU's advisory committee on mergers, made up of national anti-trust officials, is due to look again at the case and the latest offers by the companies next Monday.

A spokesman for Germany's Federal Cartel Office said in Berlin on Friday that the office still opposed the alliance and that it knew that anti-trust authorities in other European countries shared this view.
The Commission must decide on the alliance by June 3. ((Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6830, fax +32 2 230

Not Available for Re-dissemination.
The proposed digital pay-TV alliance between Kirch and  Bertelsmann has run into renewed criticism from the
German competition authority, despite the two partners offering further concessions.

A spokesman for the German federal cartel office said the latest Kirch/Bertelsmann offer, of allowing digital pay-TV platform Premiere to be distributed by cable television operators other than Deutsche Telekom and selling off a 25 per cent stake in Kirch decoder subsidiary BetaResearch, was not sufficient to meet the watchdog's reservations about the deal. The  European Commission, due to make a final ruling on the Kirch/Bertelsmann alliance by 3 June, has yet to comment on the latest concessions.

Proposed  Kirch-Bertelsmann TV Venture In Jeopardy,  EU Official  Says

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- A proposed digital TV alliance between German media companies Kirch Group AG
and Bertelsmann AG has run afoul of the  European Union's competition rules, an  EU spokesman said Sunday.

The EU's Executive  Commission is due to vote Wednesday on Kirch and  Bertelsmann's plans to market a digital television decoder. The panel can veto mergers or alliances it believes violate the  EU's fair-competition rules within the 15-nation bloc.

In a letter Saturday to the commission, Kirch and Bertelsmann rejected demands to change their proposed venture.

"The EU will have to submit a negative opinion on Wednesday" as the groups have refused to modify the terms of their alliance, EU competition commissioner Karel Van Miert said Sunday.

In a report to be published Monday by the German weekly magazine Focus, Bertelsmann executive board member Michael Dornemann said the two companies had rejected a major condition for EU approval of the venture.

Under the groups' original plan, Kirch and Bertelsmann unit CLT-UFA would merge their digital TV businesses and jointly market digital TV in Germany using the "d-box" developed by Kirch as a standard decoder. They planned to distribute the service via Deutsche Telekom AG's cable network.

The EU Commission last week ordered that third-party broadcasters must be allowed to market their programs jointly without restrictions on Bertelsmann's Premiere channel, according to Focus. However, the two media groups have drawn the line on such conditions, because "manipulation favoring others would destroy our competitive position," Focus quoted Dornemann as saying.

The commission has said in the past that the proposed television alliance would smother competition in the emerging digital market if it were to go ahead as planned.

Van Miert demanded that the two groups open access to their pay-TV hook-up so that competitors can select individual programs for broadcast via other multimedia and telecommunication providers, according to a report to appear Monday in the German weekly magazine, Der Spiegel. However, the two media groups have rejected this move as one that would destroy the value of the merger, Der Spiegel reported.

BRUSSELS, May 24 (AFP) - German media group  Bertelsmann submitted no compromise offer to the European Commission by a deadline to win approval for its digital television alliance partner Kirch,  EU sources said Sunday.

The two companies who want to regroup their digital television operations in a subscriber channel called Premiere had been given until Saturday evening to offer concessions to the  commission.

At a high level meeting last Tuesday between Bertelsmann and Kirch officials and the commission, chaired by the European anti-monopolies commissioner Karel van Miert, the companies said they had no more concessions to make.

"They refused to present new proposals, because, they said, they had reached the absolute limit on profitability for the project," a commission source said.
Two weeks ago Bertelsmann said they were ready for a "no" from Brussels for the merger plans.

On Sunday, a spokesman for Kirch, pointing out that the commission makes a final decision on Wednesday, said: "We still believe that the proposal that we presented to the commission was acceptable."

The two groups have rejected a demand by Van Miert that they cede a majority stake in their joint Beta Research company to an independent third party, Der Spiegel said.
The European Commission launched an enquiry into the project in January and on Thursday last week, the
European Union's consultative committee turned down the alliance.

BRUSSELS, May 24 (AFP) - The  European Commission is poised to reject a bid by the German  Bertelsmann
media group to form a digital television alliance with its partner Kirch, an  EU source said Sunday.
The scheme is set to be turned down after  Bertelsmann failed to submit a compromise offer to the  commission
before Saturday evening's deadline, according to the source.
The two companies want to regroup their digital television operations in a subscriber channel called Premiere. Failure would spell the end of the alliance between the two groups over the regrouping.
At a high level meeting last Tuesday between Bertelsmann and Kirch officials and the commission, chaired by the European anti-monopolies commissioner Karel van Miert, the companies said they had no more concessions to make.

"They refused to present new proposals, because, they said, they had reached the absolute limit on profitability for the project," a commission source said.

On Sunday, a spokesman for Kirch, pointing out that the commission makes a final decision on Wednesday, said: "We still believe that the proposal that we presented to the commission was acceptable."
Bertelsmann is waiting for the official decision before issuing a response.
Two weeks ago Bertelsmann said they were ready for a "no" from Brussels for the merger plans.

The two groups have rejected a demand by Van Miert that they cede a majority stake in their joint Beta Research company to an independent third party, Der Spiegel said.

A consultative committee made up of experts from the EU's 15 member states is due to give its opinion on the proposal on Monday.
Its response is also expected to be negative. The committee has shared Van Miert's stance to date.

The European Commission launched an enquiry into the project in January out of concern that the deal would give the two group a dominant position close to a monopoly.
On Thursday last week the European Union's consultative committee turned down the alliance.

For Kirch the alliance with its former rival Bertelsmann has been extremely important. The group denied reports in the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung that it is suffering a "serious financial crisis".

Kirch, Bertelsmann Reject Latest E.U. JV Proposal-Reports

MUNICH (Dow Jones)--German media groups Kirch Group AG (G.KCH) and Bertelsmann AG (G.BRT) have rejected a major condition for  European Union approval of their digital television venture, Bertelsmann executive board member Michael Dornemann told the German weekly magazine Focus in an advance article to appear Monday.

The E.U.  Commission had ordered last Wednesday that third party broadcasters be allowed to market their programs jointly without restrictions on  Bertelsmann's Premiere channel, according to Focus.

However, the two media groups have drawn the line with such conditions, because "manipulation favoring others would destroy our competitive position," Dornemann was quoted as saying in the Focus interview.

Under the groups' original plan, Kirch and Bertelsmann unit CLT-UFA would merge their digital TV businesses and jointly market digital TV in Germany using the "d-box" developed by Kirch as standard decoder. They plan to distribute the service via Deutsche Telekom AG's (G.DTL) cable network.

In the meantime, Deutsche Telekom has told the E.U. it would offer to provide up to 16 digital channels for a certain time for a second pay-TV broadcaster, Focus said.

Elsewhere, E.U. competition commissioner Karel van Miert has demanded that the two groups open access to their pay- TV hook-up so that competitors can select individual programs for broadcast via other multimedia and tele- communication providers, according to an advance report to appear Monday in the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel.

However, the two media groups have rejected this move as "raisin-picking" that would destroy the value of the merger, Der Spiegel reported.

The E.U. Commission is expected to rule on the merger June 3, but the two groups have effectively until Monday to come up with a solution before Commission technical experts evaluate the proposals.
Neither group was immediately available to comment Sunday.

The European Commission is likely to reject a planned pay-television merger in Germany this week, throwing into question the development of that country's digital pay-TV market, said a  commission official familiar with the situation. If Kirch Group and CLT-Ufa, the TV unit of Bertelsmann AG,fail to make any more concessions to ensure competition in Germany's digital TV market, EU antitrust guardians will reject their merger proposal, the person said. "Kirch and  Bertelsmann had until Saturday night to make new proposals. They didn't make new proposals because they said that this would make [the deal] economically unviable," he said. The two media groups confirmed they aren't offering additional compromises on their plan.

BERLIN, May 25 (Reuters) - Germany's cartel office said on Monday the majority of European Commission states were dissatisfied with assurances from Kirch,  Bertelsmann AG and Deutsche Telekom, regarding their planned German TV alliance.
The office told Reuters compromises from  Deutsche Telekom AG and media groups  Bertelsmann and Leo
Kirch were inadequate.

It said it supported European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert's rejection of the proposed digital pay-TV alliance between all three groups.

Signs of a rift in the 20-seat European Commission emerged earlier on Monday over whether to block the controversial deal.

Van Miert has said he wants the deal stopped unless the companies make serious concessions to prevent the establishment of a lasting monopoly in the German pay-TV market.

The Commission has set itself a June 3 deadline for a decision on whether to block the alliance but it is keen to announce a verdict on Wednesday. ((Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525, frankfurt.newsroom@reuters.com)).

EU split on German TV deal, experts back Van Miert.

BRUSSELS, May 25 (Reuters) - The 20-member  European Commission appeared split on Monday over whether or not it should block a controversial German television alliance between Leo Kirch,  Bertelsmann AG and Deutsche Telekom AG .

A German cartel office spokesman told Reuters that merger experts from most of the 15 European Union states had advised the Commission on Monday to ban the deal, backing the stance adopted by European Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert.

This is the second time this month the EU's merger advisory committee - made up of representatives from the bloc's 15 governments and competition authorities, including the Berlin cartel office - have issued such a recommendation to the EU executive.

The only EU country not to support Van Miert was Luxembourg, home to media group CLT-Ufa, another source said.

CLT-Ufa brought together the television interests of Bertelsmann and Audiofina in 1997 and is a direct part of the alliance.

Van Miert has said consistently he wants the deal stopped unless the companies involved make serious concessions to prevent the creation of a monopoly in the German pay-TV market.

Commission spokeswoman Martine Reicherts said the alliance partners had told the Commission on Saturday they did not intend to improve their offer. But that was not the end of the story.

"It is difficult to say at this stage what the decision will be. The (Commission decision) requires a majority of 11 votes and it risks being contested," Reicherts told reporters.

She declined to say whether any commissioners favoured letting the deal go ahead. The alliance has met stiff opposition from Germany's federal cartel office, German public broadcasters and private cable operators in both Germany and Austria.
The Commission has set a June 3 deadline for a decision but is keen to announce a verdict on Wednesday, May
27.

Bertelsmann and Kirch again ruled out any further concessions on Monday, saying they would undermine the project's economic viability. They have warned there will be no digital TV in Germany unless they are allowed to pool forces.

The two companies want to merge their Premiere pay-TV venture with Kirch's DF1 digital pay-TV channel in a deal that would also include former telecoms monopoly Deutsche Telekom.

CLT-Ufa said last week that if the Commission blocked the alliance, Bertelsmann and Kirch were likely to concentrate their efforts on beefing up the digital programme at jointly owned Premiere - a scenario industry sources also thought probable.

Commission sources told Reuters the EU executive's president, Luxembourg's Jacques Santer, was reluctant to sink the deal and might have the backing of German Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann and research chief Edith Cresson.

But a source close to Van Miert said he was likely to argue that a decision which appeared politically motivated would revive calls - silenced with great difficulty last year - for an independent European competition authority, especially from the Berlin cartel office.

Van Miert has become widely respected since he took over the job of EU antitrust chief in 1993, but he has ruffled a few feathers where national interests have been at stake and some of his fellow Commissioners reckon he has become too powerful.

The EU's merger experts unanimously backed Van Miert over the Kirch/Bertelsmann deal at a meeting on May 6 but they had to reconsider the case because concessions had been offered.

The companies proposed to sell 25 percent of Kirch's broadcast rights to Hollywood films - seen as crucial to rival projects - and sell off 25 percent in BetaResearch, a Kirch-owned firm with exclusive rights to set-top box technology.

They also pledged to let private cable firms market Premiere with conditions that were later rejected by cable operators.

Bertelsmann-Kirch TV plan remains in the air: EU

BRUSSELS, May 25 (AFP) - A planned merger of the digital television businesses of  Bertelsmann and Kirch of
Germany remains undecided, a spokeswoman for the  EU Commission said on Monday.
"It is difficult to foresee the outcome of this among the 20  EU commissioners," the spokeswoman said.

"The Commissioner for Competition, Karel Van Miert, who is recommending a ban against the proposed merger, is one commissioner among 20," she said.
"It is possible that the decision due in principle on Wednesday might be delayed until June 3."

But she confirmed that the two German companies, in a letter received by the Commission late on Saturday, had said that they would not make any more concessions.

She added: "The plan to merge the digital television interests of Bertelsmann and Kirch concerns not merely aspects of competition policy but also aspects of industrial policy."

Van Miert holds that a merger would result in abuse of a dominant position in the digital television services market in Germany and therefore be in breach of EU competition law.

But sources say that several European commissioners, notably Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann, Communications Commissioner Marcelino Oreja and Research Commissioner Edith Cresson, hold that the merger should not be banned because the German market would then be open to US companies.
The EU consultative committee on mergers, composed of specialists in competition questions from the 15 EU
states, was to give its view later on Monday and was expected to follow the opinion of Van Miert as it did on May
7.

FRANKFURT, May 25 (Reuters) - German media group Kirch said on Monday it does not expect a decision by the European Commission's Competition Authority on its digital television project with  Bertelsmann AG before Wednesday.

The Commission is reviewing the companies' plans to merge their jointly-held pay-television group Premiere with Kirch's digital pay TV channel DF1. The deal includes cooperation with Germany's dominant telephone company Deutsche Telekom AG .
"A decision by the Commission can be made at the earliest by Wednesday," a spokesman for Kirch said on
Monday. "Until now we have received no news from the Commission."

The two German media companies would make no further comment on the issue until the Commission had reached a decision, Kirch said.

Kirch and Bertelsmann had made wide-reaching compromises in order to facilitate the planned merger, Kirch added.
Although Bertelsmann and Kirch have bowed to Commission pressure to make concessions, Germany's Federal
Cartel Office and rival cable TV operator Otelo Communications have voiced strong opposition to the deal.

BRUSSELS, May 25 (Reuters) - The  European Commission will ask anti-trust experts from the 15 EU states on Monday afternoon to block the proposed TV alliance between Germany's Kirch group, Bertelsmann AG and Deutsche Telekom, a Commission source said.

Separately, Commission spokeswoman Martine Reicherts said Kirch/Bertelsmann had informed the Commission in writing on Saturday that they would not make any further concessions to win  EU regulatory approval for their planned pay-TV deal.
The deal will be on the Commission agenda on Wednesday, but the source said that a negative ruling was likely
to face opposition from Commission President Jacques Santer and at least three other Commissioners who sit on
the 20-seat Commission executive.

Reicherts also signalled a heated debate within the Commission. "It is difficult to say at this stage what the decision will be. It needs 11 votes in favour and risks being contested," she told reporters.

EU Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said last Wednesday that he would ban the deal unless the companies improved their offers of concessions to prevent the creation of a lasting monopoly in the German pay-TV market.

FRANKFURT, May 25 (Reuters) - German media group Bertelsmann AG said on Monday it was not prepared to make further concessions to the  European Union Commission on its digital TV alliance plans with Kirch group.

"There is no room for further concessions," a spokesman for  Bertelsmann said. Concessions already made to appease the EU Commission had put the economic viability of the project in question,  Bertelsmann said.
"Further concessions would undermine the economic basis for the project," the company said.
The European Commission is reviewing the companies' plans to merge their jointly-held pay-television group
Premiere with Kirch's digital pay TV channel DF1.
The potential deal includes cooperation with Germany's dominant telephone company Deutsche Telekom AG . Commission spokeswoman Martine Reicherts said Kirch/Bertelsmann had informed the Commission in writing on

pay-TV deal.
Although Bertelsmann and Kirch have bowed to Commission pressure to make concessions, Germany's Federal
Cartel Office and rival cable TV operator Otelo Communications have voiced strong opposition to the deal.

Bertelsmann and Kirch have made concessions on programming, transmission technology and distribution in order to try and win Commission approval.

The European Commission, which is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss the matter, is believed to be ready to block the companies' plans, according to EU commission sources. ((Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69

She declined to say whether any Commissioners were in favour of allowing the deal which has met stiff

But the same year he successfully managed to block a previous deal between the same German partners to provide pay-TV services in the MSG Media Service joint venture.

Van Miert will try to win the support later on Monday of an advisory committee made up of representatives from the Berlin cartel office, the Bonn economics ministry and competition authorities from the other EU states.

EU Rejection/DF-1 Future -2: Under Financial  Pressure

A rejection by the  commission also would raise questions about the digital development of Premiere and the future of DF-1, Kirch's own, unsuccessful digital service which was supposed to be folded into Premiere. Most crucially, it would raise concern about the finances of company founder Leo Kirch, who already has spent billions of dollars on launching DF-1. Under the terms of the proposed alliance,  Bertelsmann would have shared those expenses. Without  Bertelsmann, Kirch would have to bear them alone. The Munich-based entrepreneur already is under severe financial pressure, which was one of the reasons he originally teamed up with  Bertelsmann.

To be sure, the commission's warning isn't necessarily the end of the deal. Like in other merger cases, both sides could still reach a last-minute compromise. The commission has until June 3 to reach a final verdict, but it usually decides several days before the deadline. Today, a committee of EU competition experts is expected to draft a recommendation for Wednesday's commission meeting.

For weeks, the commission and the companies have haggled over ways to ensure that new market entrants would be able to compete with the towering alliance in the digital TV business. Kirch and Bertelsmann have offered to sell off part of their vast programming supplies to hopeful competitors. But they want to retain control
over the packaging of those programs. The EU wants to allow competitors to pick and choose individual programs or channels from Premiere's offer and combine them with own programming or services. But Kirch and Bertelsmann said such cherry-picking would allow rivals to loot the best of their selection without helping to pay
for less attractive programs.

In addition, the two companies have offered to open up Beta Research, a Kirch subsidiary charged with the marketing of digital decoder boxes, to partners other than Bertelsmann and cable giant Deutsche Telekom AG, who would have taken a share in it under the terms of the merger proposal. After fresh concessions from Deutsche Telekom, the commission official said, that part of the merger was "all but clearable."

E.U. Decision  On Kirch, Bertelsmann TV Plan "Very Difficult"

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission won't necessarily reject a planned pay-television merger between German media groups Kirch Group AG (G.KCH) and Bertelsmann AG (G.BRT), even though its chief competition commissioner has suggested the plan is unacceptable, a commission spokeswoman said Monday.

Martine Reicherts, spokeswoman of  commission president Jacques Santer, told journalists it's "very difficult" to predict the  commission's ruling on the merger. She suggested that questions of "industrial policy," including European cultural issues, strengthened the case for approving the merger.

Reicherts said the full 20-member commission plans to discuss the merger Wednesday, but commissioners could put off a decision until next week.

"It's a true point for discussion. It's not a decided point," she said, noting that competition chief Karel Van Miert, who opposes the merger, is just "one commissioner of 20."
The deadline for a Commission decision is June 3. (MORE) Dow Jones Newswires 25-05-98

E.U./Kirch/Bertelsmann -2: Most Officials Against  Alliance

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission is almost certain to reject Wednesday the proposed digital television alliance between German broadcaster Kirch Group (G.KCH) and German media giant Bertelsmann AG (B.BRT), according to sources who insisted on anonymity Monday.
A meeting of E.U. member country competition experts was held Monday to advise the  Commission on the
Kirch/ Bertelsmann case.
The sources told Dow Jones Newswires that only Luxembourg officials attending the meeting were in favor of the
Kirch/Bertelsmann alliance.

The rest supported the view of competition commissioner Karel Van Miert, who said over the weekend he would block the alliance in its existing form, they said.

"The decision has yet to be made," said Matthius Wulf, spokesman for CLT-UFA, the television joint venture participated in by Bartelsmann, referring to the advisory committee that met Monday in Brussels. "It's taken by Commissioners, not by this committee."

Normally, Commissioners follow the decision taken by the advisory committee on competition matters. But, Wulf said, "this is not a usual case."


Kirch and Bertelsmann want to pool their resources to create a digital TV platform out of Premiere, a German analog Pay-TV channel in which both countries share a financial and operations interest.

On the Agenda
Bertelsmann, Kirch Deal Faces EU Rejection

BONN -- The  European Commission is likely to reject a planned pay-television merger in Germany this week, throwing into question the development of that country's nascent digital pay-TV market.

If Kirch Group and CLT-Ufa, the TV unit of Bertelsmann AG, fail to make any more concessions to ensure competition in Germany's digital TV market, EU antitrust guardians will reject their merger proposal, said a commission official familiar with the situation on Sunday.

"Kirch and Bertelsmann had until Saturday night to make new proposals. They did not make new proposals because they said that this would make (the deal) economically unviable," he said.

Under these conditions, he said, the commission will reject the merger at its weekly meeting on Wednesday. The two media groups confirmed that they are not offering additional compromises on their plan. The companies are "at the end of their ropes," said Bertelsmann board member Michael Dornemann in the German newsmagazine Focus.

A veto from the EU would mark a new, dramatic milestone in the struggle to build a digital pay-TV market in Germany. An earlier plan by the companies to join forces was blocked by the commission in 1994 for antitrust reasons. For years afterwards, Kirch and Bertelsmann failed to agree on a modified partnership. After a long feud, varying alliances with other media groups and a botched attempt by Kirch to go it alone in the new and expensive digital business, the two teamed up again last summer -- only to have their effort run into new trouble with competition watchdogs.

The deal's collapse would introduce new roadblocks and uncertainty into Europe's biggest TV market, well before digital TV has even gotten off the ground there. Premiere, Germany's most successful pay-TV channel that was to be the centerpiece of the planned merger, would have to look for a new shareholder. As part of their agreement, Kirch and Bertelsmann had hoped to split ownership of Premiere between the themselves after France's Canal Plus SA decided to sell its stake in the channel.
"Canal Plus would have to find a new buyer," said one executive close to the merger talks.

A rejection by the commission also would raise questions about the digital development of Premiere and the future of DF-1, Kirch's own, unsuccessful digital service which was supposed to be folded into Premiere. Most crucially, it would raise concern about the finances of company founder Leo Kirch, who already has spent billions of dollars on launching DF-1. Under the terms of the proposed alliance, Bertelsmann would have shared those expenses. Without Bertelsmann, Mr. Kirch would have to bear them alone. The Munich-based entrepreneur already is under severe financial pressure, which was one of the reasons he originally teamed up with Bertelsmann.

To be sure, the commission's warning isn't necessarily the end of the deal. Like in other merger cases, both sides could still reach a last-minute compromise. The commission has until June 3 to reach a final verdict, but it usually decides several days before the deadline.

For weeks, the commission and the companies have haggled over ways to ensure that new market entrants would be able to compete with the towering alliance in the digital TV business. Kirch and Bertelsmann have offered to sell off part of their vast programming supplies to hopeful competitors. But they want to retain control

over the packaging of those programs. The EU wants to allow competitors to pick and choose individual programs or channels from Premiere's offer and combine them with own programming or services. But Kirch and Bertelsmann said such cherry-picking would allow rivals to loot the best of their selection without helping to pay
for less attractive programs.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union's top competition official refused to forecast Tuesday whether the E.U. Commission will block the digital television joint venture of Germany's Kirch Group (G.KCH) and Bertelsmann AG (G.BRT).

Speaking before the  European Parliament's Economics  Commission, E.U. Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said: 'We'll have to wait and see' what transpires over the next few days. The 20-member E.U. Commission is expected to discuss the Kirch/Bertelsmann venture Wednesday.

Van Miert also castigated the Germany companies for waiting until the last minute before considering serious proposals that might allay the Commission's competition concerns.
He also said the Commission wouldn't be at fault if Kirch and Bertelsmann fail to gain clearance of the venture. 'I
can't help it if the two main players are at loggerheads,' Van Miert said, without elaborating.

Van Miert said the development of digital television in Germany, and in Europe generally, would 'work much better based on a competitive framework and not a dominant position.'

German TV Scene To Change With Or Without  Bertelsmann-Kirch Merger

BONN -(Dow Jones)- As the European Union Commission nears a critical decision on whether to allow a pay-TV merger between a Bertelsmann AG unit and Kirch Group, Germany's television landscape appears about to change.

A last round of talks between company executives and EU competition officials took place in Brussels Tuesday. Despite intense opposition to the merger proposal from EU antitrust chief Karel Van Miert, it remains uncertain how the commissioners will approach the issue when they meet Wednesday.

Van Miert reiterated his position, telling a committee of the European Parliament the alliance would mark a step backward toward natonal monopolies. The antitrust chief has called for blocking the proposed Kirch alliance unless the partners take steps to guarantee competition in the German digital-TV market, Tuesday's Wall Street Journal Europe reported.

Rivals Kirch and CLT-UFA, the TV arm of Bertelsmann and Luxembourg broadcaster CLT, called a truce earlier this year, agreeing to use Kirch's "d-box" as their standard decoder for digital TV. Under the venture, CLT-Ufa and Kirch would take joint control of Premiere, Germany's leading pay-TV channel. Kirch will merge its existing digital pay-TV service, DF1, into Premiere. Through another company known as BetaResearch, the partners plan to distribute programs over Deutsche Telekom AG's (DT) vast cable network.

The EU Commission last week ordered that third-party broadcasters must be allowed to market their programs jointly without restrictions on Bertelsmann's Premiere channel, according to the German weekly magazine Focus. However, the two media groups have drawn the line on such conditions, Focus added. The magazine quoted Bertelsmann executive board member Michael Dornemann as saying the terms "would destroy our competitive position."

If the three firms were to merge their interests, they could lock up all German television rights for movies and sporting events, Van Miert argued.

In an apparent bid to mollify the commission, Deutsche Telekom on Tuesday announced plans to unbundle its broad-band cable subsidiary, the unit that would carry digital signals under the alliance. The company made no reference to the negotiations with the Commission, but an alliance insider said, "It is pointing in the right direction."

A proposal from Kirch and Bertelsman to drop Telekom from the deal didn't impress Brussels. Bertelsmann insists more concessions are impossible as the project in its current form is already on the brink of being no longer viable financially.

Digital television promises a huge number of channels along with superior picture and sound quality. The commission's view is that in the nascent digital market, the same groups shouldn't control both access to the channels and program content - in particular films and sports rights, which are likely to be the most popular digital offerings.

Van Miert's hard-line stance was backed Monday by an advisory committee of competition officials from EU countries, which voted 14-1 in favor of the antitrust chief's recommendation. Only Luxembourg was opposed, according to people familiar with the matter. The panel's vote isn't binding, however, and the only decision that counts is that of the commissioners.

Van Miert wouldn't say if the Commission actually will vote this week. The panel could delay its vote until June 3, the final deadline for the case.

Page 109 of 124 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Asked if he expects an 11th-hour agreement with Kirch, Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom, Van Miert replied: "We'll have to wait and see what happens in the next days."

Martine Reicherts, the commission's spokeswoman, said the planned TV alliance raises issues of "industrial policy" and "cultural policy," not just competition.

German members of the European Parliament Tuesday pushed Van Miert to reconsider his opposition. German media reports in recent days have suggested that media mogul Rupert Murdoch might take advantage of any decision to block the alliance. Murdoch's European television interests are now limited to the United Kingdom, and his efforts in recent years to join forces with Kirch have failed.

Van Miert argued it would be wrong to turn a blind eye to the dominant position the Kirch-Bertelsmann alliance would have because of Murdoch. If Murdoch's entry into the German market happens, Van Miert said, "that's the way it is."

Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corp., Monday signaled the company's continuing interest in expanding its media activities in Europe despite setbacks he has suffered there.

"We will continue to have conversations with European companies who approach us," Murdoch said in a speech to the European Audiovisual Conference in Birmingham, England. "We regret that BSkyB's attempt to form a joint venture with Kirch in German pay-television failed last year, and we remain receptive to any other opportunities."

News Corp. (NWS) controls a 40% stake in British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC (BSY), Britain's largest pay-TV broadcaster. Regulators last year scuttled a plan for BSkyB to team up with Kirch. Last month, Murdoch failed to gain control of Mediaset SpA, a media holding company controlled by Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's former prime minister. Mediaset rejected Murdoch's $3.2 billion offer, mainly because it considered the price too low.

Kirch recently warned that a veto from Brussels would force it to pull the plug on its existing pay-TV service, DF1. Without a merger with Premiere, jointly owned by Kirch and Bertelsmann, Kirch Managing Director Peter Halm warned a month ago that DF1 "has no hope of staying alive."

Leo Kirch, and owner of the Kirch Group, would be hard hit if this happened. Not only would he be left with thousands of his "d-box" digital decoders, which cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop, he would also be left with a mountain of programming bought from Hollywood studios for DF1 at great expense in 1996.

While closely held Kirch is secretive about its account books, reports the company is in financial trouble have made the rounds repeatedly over the past year. Earlier this month, the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung claimed Kirch had liquidity problems after banks turned down requests for additional loans. Kirch dismissed the story as incorrect and out of date.

Speculation that Kirch will be forced to sell assets to cover its liquidity problems have made the rounds for nearly a year. Recent reports hold that the company wanted to ditch its 40% in German publishing group Axel Springer AG. Both companies denied the report.

Bertelsmann, on the other hand, is in good shape. As one of the largest media groups in the world, its 1997 sales in the fiscal year ending June 30 hit 22 billion marks ($38 billion), from 21.5 billion marks a year earlier, and net profit rose to 1 billion marks from 905 million marks. It also boasts low debt exposure in comparison to its competitors.

In contrast to Kirch, CLT-Ufa, has said it would keep its German pay-TV business in the event of a merger-veto from the commission.

Premiere, in which Kirch has a minority stake, would be used "to expand the nucleus of German pay-TV," the company said last week. The channel, driven by movies and live sport, currently has around 120,000 subscribers, while DF1 counts 160,000.

BRUSSELS, May 26 (Reuters) -  European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Tuesday that the Commission, the European Union's antitrust watchdog, must take a position on the proposed German pay-TV alliance between Leo Kirch, Bertelsmann AG and Deutsche Telekom on Wednesday.
However, Van Miert did not rule out the possibility that a formal decision may have to wait until the following
Wednesday - a June 3 deadline which the  Commission has set itself for a final decision.
Van Miert would also not rule out further meetings between his Commission team and representatives from the
German companies.
"The Commission has to fix its position tomorrow anyway," he told reporters after attending a meeting of the
European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee.

On Monday, signs emerged that some of Van Miert's fellow Commissioners on the 20-seat executive may not support his proposal to block the deal.

But a clear majority of merger experts from the 15-nation EU on Monday advised the EU executive for the second time this month to ban the deal.

Van Miert has said consistently he wants the deal stopped unless the companies make serious concessions to prevent the establishment of a lasting monopoly in the German pay-TV market.

Bertelsmann and Kirch on Monday ruled out any further concessions saying they would undermine the project's economic viability. They have warned there will be no digital TV in Germany unless they are allowed to pool forces.

FOCUS-Deutsche Telekom to spin off cable TV.
By William Boston

English
(c) 1998 Reuters Limited
BONN, May 26 (Reuters) - German telecommunications group  Deutsche Telekom said on Tuesday it would spin off its loss-making cable television activities and seek partners to break it up into at least six regional companies.

The announcement, expected for some time, was seen as a move by Telekom to head off regulatory action by the European Commission, which has pressed for barring dominant phone carriers from operating cable TV networks.

"The spin-off is a decision that looks toward the future, that will provide our customers a new attractive offering," said Gerd Tenzer, Telekom board member in charge of cable TV.

Telekom ran up cable TV losses of 1.3 billion marks ($737 million) last year. Facing a possible regulatory ruling that could force it to slash monthly cable TV rates, Telekom said last week it would take a charge this year of up to 4.5 billion marks.

Under pressure to make cable TV profitable, the management board approved a plan on Monday to put the cable assets into a fully-owned subsidiary on January 1, 1999 and begin talks with potential investors about creating regional cable companies.

By the year 2000 at least six regional cable firms would be set up. The regional operators would in turn jointly own a service unit that would market programming to the customer.

A Telekom spokesman said the company "could give up the majority in the regional companies" to other investors.

Telekom said it would place no restrictions on how other operators develop the network in the future, which industry observers said could open the door for operators to offer phone services and Internet access over the cable network.

That was welcome news for rival cable TV operators, which have refused to enter talks about a partnership with Telekom unless the phone giant agrees to take a minority position and give them a free hand to develop new services.

"This means that Telekom is willing to give up industrial leadership of the regional companies," said a spokesman for the Association of Private Cable Network Operators (ANGA). "This is also necessary in order to attract competent investors."

Of some 20 million cable TV subscribers in Germany, Telekom has just 5.6 million under direct contract. The rest are served by three big rival operators and hundreds of smaller firms.
Telekom's biggest cable TV rivals could also become its most likely partners in the future.

Otelo Communications GmbH, one of Telekom's main competitors in long-distance phone services, has some 1.9 million cable TV customers and has offered act as trustee on behalf of other cable operators in talks with
Telekom.

After Otelo, the next two largest cable operators are Robert Bosch GmbH, which has one million cable customers, and Augsburg-based TSS Telekabel Service Sued GmbH, with one million customers the biggest family-owned cable operator.
Page 113 of 124 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Otelo declined immediate comment.

Robert Bosch, an electronics group, said it was still too soon to judge Telekom's offer. "When we know more details we will begin making our own plans," a Bosch spokesman said.

German cable television networks are organised into four so-called levels. Levels three and four are the most important in the relationship between Telekom and other operators.

Level three is the network that runs from the head station - which receives programmes broadcast from satellites to be distributed in the local cable network - across public property to the edge of private homes or apartment buildings.
Level four begins at the private property line.

As a former monopoly only Telekom operates level three networks with a few exceptions in eastern Germany where independent operators have built their own head stations. ($ = 1.764 German Marks).

EU holds last-ditch talks with Kirch, Bertelsmann.

BRUSSELS, May 26 (Reuters) - European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert held talks on Tuesday
with Leo Kirch and Bertelsmann's head of entertainment Michael Dornemann to try to head off an  EU ban of their
pay-television alliance with Deutsche Telekom, a Commission source said.
The source had no information on the outcome of the talks which took place less than 24 hours before the
European Commission was expected to discuss a proposal by Van Miert to stop the deal.

The source close to Van Miert also said that Telekom's announcement on Tuesday that it would spin off its cable television activities and seek partners to break it up into regional companies "had nothing to do with Kirch and Bertelsmann".

"This is totally independent. It's an announcement that Deutsche Telekom had made in November last year orally...but the problem with Bertelsmann/Kirch is the separation of network level three and four which is independent of who owns and operates level three," he said.

German cable television networks are organised into four so-called levels. Levels three and four are the most important in the relationship between Telekom and other cable operators which had criticised the pay-TV alliance as being anti-competitive.
Van Miert said on Tuesday he would ask his colleagues to block the alliance at their regular weekly meeting on
Wednesday morning on the grounds that it would establish a lasting monopoly in the German pay-TV market.
But the Commission often settles merger competition concerns in last-minute talks. (Amelia Torres +32 2 287

BRUSSELS, May 25 -- The  European Commission said it was set to reject the planned digital television alliance of a Bertelsmann A.G. venture and the Kirch Group as early as Wednesday, after the companies failed to ease antitrust concerns over the weekend.

The commission received a letter Saturday from Kirch and  Bertelsmann saying they would not go any further than the concessions they had already offered, said Martine Reicherts, spokeswoman for the  commission.

An advisory committee of antitrust officials from the 15 European Union countries were scheduled to meet this afternoon to review the objections of Karel van Miert, the competition commissioner.
If they support his position, Mr. van Miert will seek majority approval from the 20-member commission, the
European Union's executive agency.

Mr. van Miert has said that the alliance, to be marketed under the CLT-UFA Premiere label, is unacceptable in its current form because it will be able to bar rivals from Germany's digital TV market by controlling access to set-top decoder boxes.

The companies could save the alliance by offering last-minute concessions between now and Wednesday, the legal deadline for the commission's ruling.

Bertelsmann and Kirch submitted a written proposal to the commission two weeks ago seeking to answer antitrust concerns, but the commission said the offer was insufficient.
Neither Kirch nor CLT-UFA would comment before the commission's decision, which is expected on Wednesday. Document nytf000020010918du5q00seg

E.U. Official  Won't Forecast Future Of Kirch-Bertelsmann

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union's top competition official refused to forecast Tuesday whether the E.U. Commission will block the digital television joint venture of Germany's Kirch Group (G.KCH) and Bertelsmann AG (G.BRT).

Speaking before the  European Parliament's Economics  Commission, E.U. Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said "We'll have to wait and see" what transpires over the next few days. The 20-member E.U. Commission is expected to discuss the Kirch/Bertelsmann venture Wednesday.

Van Miert also castigated the Germany companies for waiting until the last minute before considering serious proposals that might allay the Commission's competition concerns.
He also said the Commission wouldn't be at fault if Kirch and Bertelsmann fail to gain clearance of the venture. "I
can't help it if the two main players are at loggerheads," said Van Miert, without elaborating.

Van Miert said the development of digital television in Germany, and in Europe generally, would "work much better based on a competitive framework and not a dominant position."

Deutsche Telekom -2:Deal Said Unrelated To Kirch-Bertelsmann

Tuesday's announcement that  Deutsche Telekom will unbundle its broad-band cable business sparked speculation that the move was a concession to the European Union Commission for the proposed digital television alliance between Kirch Group (G.KCH) and Bertelsmann AG (B.BRT).

Kirch and Bertelsmann want to pool their resources to create a digital TV platform out of Premiere, a German analog Pay-TV channel in which both share a financial and operations interest.

And since Deutsche Telekom dominates the cable network market throughout Germany, it would be seen as exclusive distributor of the digital TV platform, sources said.

A spokesman for Telekom, however, said Tuesday's announcement isn't related to the E.U.'s pending decision on the Kirch-Bertelsmann alliance.

A last round of talks between company executives and E.U. competition officials is underway in Brussels Tuesday, and it remains uncertain how, or even if, commissioners will reach agreement on the matter at their meeting Wednesday.
'This resolution has nothing to do with the E.U. Commission decision' on Kirch-Bertelsmann, the spokesman said.
'Our plans to unbundle the cable business in this manner were announced back in November, and this is just a
further step in the restructuring.'


Late last November, Telekom said it would spin off its cable television business into a newly structured unit, paving the way for possible new business partners.

WSJE: EU Commission Set For Talks On Kirch, Bertelsmann

From Tuesday's Wall Street Journal
Europe
By Julie Wolf and Cacilie Rohwedder

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission is expected to hold talks Tuesday with Kirch Group and
Bertelsmann AG in a last-ditch bid to head off a European Union ruling against the companies' planned
pay-television venture in Germany, according to people familiar with the case.

The talks come as divisions have surfaced within the commission over EU antitrust chief Karel Van Miert's call for the alliance involving Kirch, Bertelsmann's TV unit CLT-Ufa and Deutsche Telekom AG to be blocked unless the companies offer further changes to guarantee competition in the German digital-TV market. The discord
increased the pressure on Van Miert to reach a negotiated settlement.
At the same time, however, the commissioner's hard-line stance was backed Monday by an advisory committee
of competition officials from EU countries. The committee voted 14-1 in favor of Van Miert's recommendation, with
only Luxembourg opposed, according to people familiar with the matter.

While the panel's vote isn't binding, it gives Van Miert additional ammunition in negotiations with the companies as well as with other commissioners, some of whom fear that a negative decision would stymie Germany's nascent digital-TV market.

Martine Reicherts, the commission's spokeswoman, signaled the depth of these doubts when she raised the possibility that Van Miert might not get the majority needed among the 20-member commission to veto the TV linkup. "It is difficult to say at this stage what the decision will be. The (draft decision) requires a majority of 11 votes and it risks being contested," Reicherts said. Van Miert is "but one of 20 commissioners," she added.

Reicherts said the planned TV alliance raises issues of "industrial policy" and "cultural policy," not just competition.

The commission is due to rule on the case at its weekly meeting Wednesday, although Reicherts and others said the decision could be delayed for a week. The final deadline for an EU ruling is June 3. Reicherts said the lobbying ahead of the commission's decision has been "intense."

Executives from Kirch and Bertelsmann are scheduled to meet commission competition officials Tuesday, according to people familiar with the case, but the companies insisted that they would make no further offers to counter the concerns raised by Van Miert.

"The economic viability of the venture is questionable already," said Bertelsmann spokesman Helmuth Runde. "Further concessions would take away the economic basis altogether." Kirch officials didn't return phone calls seeking comment. Insiders said, however, that the companies are bracing themselves for a rejection from the commission.

Although Reicherts declined to elaborate on the positions of individual commissioners, people familiar with the situation said Van Miert's stance is strongly opposed by Commission President Jacques Santer, Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann and Culture Commissioner Marcelino Oreja.

EU Commission/Kirch, Bertelsmann -2: Santer Stance Key

Moreover, Regional Affairs Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies, Research Commissioner Edith Cresson and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy also are likely to express doubts about blocking the venture, these people added.

Commission officials were uncertain about whether Van Miert's opponents - who alone don't have enough votes to overrule the competition commissioner - would be able to garner more strength. Of key importance could be the stance taken by Santer, who is from Luxembourg - where CLT-Ufa is based and boasts as chairman of its board of directors a former  commission president, Gaston Thorn.

Politically, "it would be hard for Van Miert to act against the views of both German commissioners and both French commissioners," said a commission official who asked not to be identified. "There's a lot of pressure on him to reach a compromise."

Others, however, pointed out that the commissioner's view on a merger case has been rejected by his colleagues only once before - in 1994, when the commission cleared a steel merger between Mannesmann of Germany, Vallourec of France and Ilva of Italy.

Moreover, the German TV alliance has been criticized by the German federal cartel office, private cable operators in Germany and Austria, and German public broadcasters. Van Miert's "economic arguments are very solid. The companies would be creating a monopoly," another commission official said.

The stakes in the commission verdict are high for all those involved. Already, Kirch and Bertelsmannn say, the delay due to the extended inquiry into the planned merger has cost them more than 100 million marks ($56.9 million). Both companies have spent years to develop a plan to build a digital-TV market in Germany. Both jointly own Premiere, an analog pay-TV channel whose future would be made uncertain by a veto from the commission. In future attempts to build a pay-TV business, both would have to contend with consumer skepticism rife after years of haggling and uncertainty.

A prohibition from the EU also would mark a setback for German telephone titan Deutsche Telekom, which is hoping that its agreement with Kirch and Bertelsmann will help turn around its unprofitable cable business.

Along with Kirch and Bertelsmann, Deutsche Telekom has offered to open up Beta Research, a Kirch subsidiary charged with the marketing of digital decoder boxes, to outside partners. In the original merger proposal, the three groups would have split ownership of Beta Research among themselves. After fresh concessions from Deutsche Telekom last week, commission officials said that this part of the merger was "all but clearable."
But it is Leo Kirch, owner and founder of the Kirch Group, who would be hit the hardest if the deal fell apart. Kirch has spent billions of dollars to build his own digital platform, DF-1, which was supposed to be merged with
Premiere. In case of an EU veto, DF-1 would be shut down. But Kirch would be left with vast programming
supplies that he amassed at huge expense to air on DF-1 and Premiere. Without the merger, Kirch could still sell
the bulk of these programs to Premiere. But it is unclear whether he could sell all of them and whether Premiere
would pay the high prices that Kirch paid for the rights in 1996.
