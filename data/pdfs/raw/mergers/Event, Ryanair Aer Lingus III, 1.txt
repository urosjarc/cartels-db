MERGERS : AER LINGUS-RYANAIR: REVIEW PERIOD EXTENDED

The European Commission has extended by one week its deadline for review of the proposed merger between the low-cost airline  Ryanair and Aer Lingus,  both of Ireland, to have time to study the new concessions submitted. It will announce its verdict by 6 March.

On 5 November 2012,  Ryanair, which owns nearly 30% of its rival, announced that it had submitted "unprecedented remedies" in its bid to obtain the  EU executive's green light for the deal announced in June 2012. It explained that the concessions would give other airlines the opportunity to acquire these crossover routes, in return for which it would give up  Aer Lingus  landing slots at London's Heathrow Airport (see  Europolitics 4521).

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary approached around ten interested airlines, including AIG, Virgin and CityJet (4502). According to The Financial Times, 43 duplicate destinations would be taken over by the British regional airline Flybe. They make up around 40% of Aer Lingus's short-haul operations. In exchange for their move to Dublin, Ryanair is thought to have agreed to sell Aer Lingus landing slots at Heathrow Airport in London. The British newspaper is reporting that Ryanair has specifically agreed to sell British Airways the right to buy nearly half the lucrative Aer Lingus slots at Heathrow that affect routes between London and Dublin, Shannon and Cork in Ireland.

Flybe has confirmed in a statement that it is holding "non-exclusive and non-binding" talks with Ryanair on a possible transfer of aircraft and routes. The question is whether the regional airline can be a sufficiently credible rival in the Commission's view to compete with Europe's number one low-cost carrier in terms of passengers. This is the factor believed to have derailed the merger between UPS and TNT, with the Commission concluding that DPD, a potential candidate for the takeover of certain TNT assets, was not a credible competitor (4564).

The €42.5 million cost-cutting plan announced by Flybe on 23 January, which includes axing 10% of its staff, is not likely to reassure the EU executive, however. The Commission finds that the existence of duplicate lines between Ryanair and Aer Lingus may kill real and potential competition on these routes.

The Commission opened an in-depth investigation (phase 2) on 29 August (4475). It rejected an earlier merger proposal and another attempt was cancelled by Ryanair itself.

The market test process is under way, ie the consultation of competitors and third parties on the additional concessions proposed.

O'Leary says Ryanair AL bid is 'radical'

Ryanair chief, Michael O'Leary, this morning said that its offer for  Aer Lingus  is "a radical and unprecedented remedies package to the  EU".
The EU's competition authorities are currently considering the E694m takeover bid and will deliver a verdict in
March.

"We believe these remedies address every current RyanairAer Lingus crossover route and all other competition issues raised by the Commission in its Statement of Objections," Mr O'Leary said.

"The remedies involve two upfront buyers each basing aircraft in Ireland to takeover and operate a substantial part of Aer Lingus' existing route network and short-haul business. This will be the first EU airline merger which will deliver structural divestitures and multiple upfront buyers. We look forward to completing our offer for Aer Lingus subject to receiving approval from the EU competition authorities in early March". Ryanair hiked its
full-year profit forecast today as strong demand in Northern Europe lifted average fares dramatically in the last three months of 2012. Dublin-based Ryanair, Europe's top low-cost airline, which has used its size and low costs to undercut struggling flag carriers, hiked its profit forecast to 540 million euros for the year to March, up from an earlier 490-520 million euro range. "We saw strong demand out of the UK, out of Germany and out of Scandinavia and that has gone straight to our bottom line," Chief Operating Officer Michael Cawley told Reuters. Strong demand in the run-up to Christmas and a high uptake of reserved seating options helped to lift ticket prices in northern Europe well above the company's forecasts, he said. Sales were not as buoyant in Southern Europe, with Spain in particular "very weak," and fare growth in Italy flat, he said. An 8 percent rise in average
fares lifted the airline to a profit of 18 million euros in the traditionally weak three months to December, compared with an average forecast by five analysts polled by Reuters of a 5 million euro loss. Fare growth compared with 5 percent in the six months to September and was way ahead of the 3 percent average forecast by three analysts polled by Reuters. Average fares will grow at a slower pace in the three months to March, however, Cawley said. Ryanair has been able to sweep up customers as traditional rivals cut back capacity in the face of slow economic growth in Europe and high fuel costs.

Ryanair submit  'radical' remedies package to EU over Aer Lingus  bid

Ryanair says it has submitted a ''radical and unprecedented'' remedies package to the  EU in connection with its offer for  Aer Lingus.
The €694m takeover bid is being examined on competition grounds.
The European Commission blocked a previous bid in 2007, saying it would create a monopoly on Irish flights. In a statement this morning, Ryanair has said the remedies involve two upfront buyers each basing aircraft in
Ireland to takeover and operate a substantial part of Aer Lingus' existing route network and short-haul business.

The airline has announced third quarter profits of €18m - up three million on last year - and it says the figures were boosted by stronger than expected pre-Christmas bookings.

Ryanair announces radical remedies on Aer Lingus  bid

28 January 2013 - Irish airline  Ryanair Holdings Plc (LON:RYA) has proposed a radical and unprecedented remedies package to win  EU support for its planned buy of rival  Aer Lingus  Group Plc (LON:AERL), the suitor's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said today.

There are two upfront buyers, each basing aircraft in Ireland, for a substantial part of  Aer Lingus'  existing route network and short-haul business, O'Leary noted, without specifying the proposed concessions. According to him, the package of remedies concerns every route, on which competition could be threatened. He added that his company expects to complete the deal in early March.
Last week the European Commission (EC) said it had extended its probe into the deal until 6 March from 27
February after the suitor offered more remedies. According to sources cited by Reuters previously, Ryanair
proposed to shed 43 routes to UK’s Flybe Group Plc (LON:FLYB) and three Aer Lingus' Heathrow routes to
British Airways plc.
So far, EU regulators had twice banned Ryanair’s attempts to buy the 70% stake it does not already have in Aer
Lingus. The latest offer of EUR1.30 (USD1.75) per share values the target at EUR694m.
Status: Bidding Type group: Type: Corporate acquisition Buyer: Ryanair Holdings Plc
Comment: Bid values the target at USD932.7m. Country: Ireland
Sector: Air Transport
Target: Aer Lingus Group Plc

Ryanair confident of securing Aer Lingus  deal as it eyes higher profits

Ryanair is confident of getting the green light from  European regulators to press ahead with its bid for rival  Aer    Lingus  after offering an "unprecedented" package of measures.

The bullish comments came as the Irish budget carrier raised its full-year profit forecast following a strong performance over the festive season.

It now expects to deliver a profit of "close to" Euros 540 million (GBP461.7m) for the year to March, up from an earlier estimate of between Euros 490m and Euros 520m, despite predicting a 19 per cent rise in fuel costs.

Chief executive Michael O'Leary said a "radical and unprecedented" package of remedies had been presented to the European Commission in a bid to win approval for its takeover offer, having made two previous attempts to secure a deal.

He said: "The remedies involve two upfront buyers each basing aircraft in Ireland to take over and operate a substantial part of Aer Lingus' existing route network and short-haul business.

"This will be the first EU airline merger which will deliver structural divestitures and multiple upfront buyers. We look forward to completing our offer for Aer Lingus subject to receiving approval from the EU competition authorities in early March."
Rival outfit Flybe last week confirmed it was in talks with Ryanair about taking over aircraft and routes if the
Dublin-based airline succeeded with its latest approach.

Ryanair currently owns about 30 per cent of Aer Lingus and launched its Euros 694m offer in June, arguing that consolidation in the airline sector meant its rival's long-term future would be secured if it became part of a larger group. Its first approach was blocked by European regulators in 2007, while a subsequent bid in 2009 was withdrawn.

Details of its attempt to assuage regulators' concerns over its latest bid emerged as Ryanair posted a profit after tax of Euros 18.1m for the three months to 31 December, up from Euros 14.9m a year earlier, on revenues 15 per cent higher at Euros 969m.

Average fares during the period rose 8 per cent, ahead of the 3 per cent rise predicted by analysts, and passenger numbers grew 3 per cent to 17.3 million.
The airline has grounded up to 80 aircraft this winter as a result of high oil prices, airport fees at Stansted and
Dublin airports and expectations for seasonally weaker demand.

As a result, it expects traffic will be 3 per cent lower in the current quarter, which is equivalent to around 400,000 passengers.
Espirito Santo analyst Gerald Khoo said: "We see scope for the positive earnings momentum to continue and for
Ryanair to benefit from any further re-rating of the airlines on the back of improved market risk appetite."
Ryanair flies from 51 bases and will be the only passenger airline operating out of Prestwick from 1 March after
Wizz Air said it was switching to Glasgow airport in a bid to win more customers.

Meanwhile, rival EasyJet confirmed yesterday that chairman Sir Michael Rake is to stand down in the summer after three years in the post. Rake survived an attempt by founder and major shareholder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou to have him ousted from the board last year, and said it had been a "tremendous experience" to chair the budget carrier over the past three years.

BUDGET airline  Ryanair has recorded a huge surge in profits as more passengers snap up their cheap fares.

And controversial airline boss Michael O'Leary yesterday revealed that he's confident of getting  EU approval to take over rival Aer Lingus.

O'Leary's company beat TARGETS and recorded third quarter after-tax profits of '18.1million — a 21 per cent rise on the same period last year.

The airline also perked up its profits outlook for the full year. This came despite an '81million hike in fuel prices as the cost of oil jumped.
The airline added that it has paid out a second special dividend of '492million to shareholders in the third quarter
— bringing to '1.53billion the funds returned to shareholders over the past five years.

RYANAIR chief executive Michael O'Leary said yesterday he thinks his airline's "radical and unprecedented" concessions will ensure success in its bid for  Aer Lingus.

The budget airline, which expects to hear back from the  EU competition authorities in March, has offered to sell parts of Aer Lingus'  network to two buyers to help ease anti-trust concerns.

"We believe these remedies address every current Ryanair/Aer Lingus crossover route and all other competition issues raised by the Commission in its Statement of Objection," said O'Leary.

His bullish comments came as Ryanair posted a surprise profit before tax of €19.3m (£16.6m) for the three months to the end of December and raised its full-year profit forecast by around €30m to €540m.

Revenues rose 15 per cent to €968.8m, fuelled by a 24 per cent jump in ancillary revenues such as reserved seat fees and baggage charges to €220.1m.

The surge in turnover soaked up some of Ryanair's rising operating expenses, up 14.6 per cent to €934.2m. Most of this increase came from fuel and oil costs, which climbed 24 per cent to €414.8m.
Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said Ryanair "continues to produce the best returns in the industry". Document CITYMO0020130129e91t0001k

Ryanair not ruling  out appeal if Aer Lingus  bid blocked; O'Leary: two buyers already agreed to take over
large part of rival's  network

RYANAIR hasn't ruled out making an appeal if the  European Commission blocks its latest attempt to buy  Aer       Lingus.
Deputy chief executive Howard Millar told the Irish Independent that he could not see why Brussels would block
Ryanair's efforts to acquire its smaller rival.

However, he said that if its proposed remedies were rejected, Ryanair would have to study the ruling in detail before making any decision.
He said he couldn't predict at this stage whether Ryanair would appeal a decision made against it.

The European Commission's competition watchdog is due to say by March 6 whether or not it will allow Ryanair to proceed with a €694m takeover battle for Aer Lingus.

Chief executive Michael O'Leary said yesterday that two upfront buyers have already agreed to take over and operate a substantial part of the Aer Lingus route network if Ryanair manages to buy the carrier. Ryanair already owns close to 30pc of Aer Lingus.

Mr Millar was speaking as Ryanair delivered a strong set of results for its third financial quarter and said it now expects to make a full-year profit of about €540m - 7pc ahead of last year and more than the €490m-€520m it had previously expected to make.

It posted an €18.1m profit after tax in the latest quarter - 21pc higher than in the corresponding quarter the previous year. Analysts had expected Ryanair to lose €5m in the three months to the end of December.

Ryanair was boosted by a slightly lower than expected fuel bill and robust passenger numbers. It also kept a tight rein on costs during the period.

Mr Millar said Ryanair laid on 2,000 extra flights in a sevenweek period approaching and during Christmas, driven by demand for services to Eastern Europe and also from the UK to destinations such as the Canaries. That
meant using some of the 80 aircraft that Ryanair had grounded for the quieter winter season.

Ryanair operated a total of 100,000 flights in the 12-week period to the end of December. Mr Millar said the performance out of Dublin had been "so-so".

Boosted Total revenue rose 15pc to €969m, with the average fare having risen 8pc in the period. Mr Millar said two percentage points of that increase were due to stronger sterling in the quarter than a year earlier.

Scheduled revenue from tickets was 12.1pc higher at €748.7m, while ancillary revenue - which includes income from items sold on board such as beverages and food - was up 24pc, at €220.1m.
Mr Millar said ancillary revenues were boosted by increased demand for priority boarding.

He declined to say what percentage of passengers were opting for the service, but said demand has beaten expectations.

Ryanair allows 33 seats of 189 on each aircraft to be reserved.

But Mr Millar said there were no plans to increase this at the moment. Doing so could hamper Ryanair's ability to turn around each aircraft within 25 minutes, he said.

Ryanair confident of Aer Lingus  deal in March
370 words
29 January 2013

Ryanair expects to gain approval for its proposed €694m takeover of  Aer Lingus  in early March.

In a statement, the company said it had submitted a "radical and unprecedented" remedies package to the  EU in support of its  Aer Lingus  offer.

"We believe these remedies address every current Ryanair/Aer Lingus crossover route and all other competition issues raised by the [European] Commission in its statement of objections," the statement added.

The commission launched its investigation into Ryanair’s latest Aer Lingus approach last August. While a ruling was scheduled for the end of January, the commission raised a number of objections with the airline concerning its initial offers of maintaining competition on routes in and out of Ireland.

Last month saw the Government — via Transport and Tourism Minister Leo Varadkar — stating its opposition to Ryanair’s plans for Aer Lingus on the grounds that they weren’t in the best interest of competition, connectivity, and employment for Ireland.

However, the Government did say it remained committed to selling its 25% stake in Aer Lingus "at the right time and under the right conditions".

Ryanair lodged its revised remedies package to the commission this month, ahead of an extended early March ruling deadline.
While press reports have suggested it is offering to offload half of Aer Lingus’s short-haul business to the
Exeter-based loss-making budget airline, FlyBe and Heathrow slots to British Airways, Ryanair was relatively
tight-lipped on details yesterday, apart from saying the revised remedies involve "two upfront buyers each basing
aircraft in Ireland to take over and operate a substantial part of Aer Lingus’s existing route network and short-haul
business".

Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary added that, if successful, the deal will mark "the first EU airline merger which will deliver structural divestitures and multiple upfront buyers".

"We look forward to completing our offer for Aer Lingus, subject to receiving approval from the EU competition authorities in early March," Mr O’Leary said.

Another commission rejection next month could see Ryanair launch a lengthy appeal into the decision or — as it has previously hinted — disposing of its near 30% stake in Aer Lingus.

Last chance for Ryanair-Aer  Lingus  deal, EU says

BRUSSELS, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Ryanair has one last chance to argue the merits of its latest attempt to acquire Irish rival Aer Lingus,  the European Union's antitrust chief said on Friday, as he prepares to decide the deal's fate.

Europe's leading low-cost carrier is making its third takeover bid for  Aer Lingus  after the  European Commission blocked its first attempt in 2007 and  Ryanair dropped its second in 2009.

Ryanair submitted a third set of proposals to the EU competition authority last month. Among them were a promise to cede 43 routes to British-based rival Flybe and three of Aer Lingus's Heathrow routes to British Airways, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier.

The Commission, which acts as competition authority in the 27-member European Union, has since sought feedback from rivals and other interested parties on those proposals.
Asked if Ryanair would need to offer more concessions, or if it still had time to do so, EU Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told Reuters: "There is one more time to discuss it."
He declined to elaborate.
The Commission has set a March 6 deadline for a decision.

Ryanair has signed a non-binding agreement with British Airways as part of its plan to acquire Aer Lingus. It is now in non-binding talks with Flybe about a transfer of aircraft and operating routes.

An antitrust lawyer said striking binding deals with both rivals could tip the Commission's decision in Ryanair's favour, as that would show all the carriers are committed to the agreements.

Ryanair in final Aer Lingus  push; Airline  enhances offer with two UK carriers in attempt to satisfy  EC on

RYANAIR, the low-fares airline, is in discussions this weekend with two British airlines on a radically enhanced package of remedies designed to secure  European Commission approval for its €694m bid for  Aer Lingus.  The airline had extensive contact with IAG, parent of British Airways, and Flybe, the regional carrier, late last week on enhancing agreements signed in December whereby the two airlines will take over a slew of  Aer Lingus  routes.

Joaquin Almunia, the  European commissioner, said on Friday that there was "one last time to discuss" the takeover. It has set a deadline of March 6 for a decision on the plan.

To meet the timetable, the enhanced remedy package could be tabled as early as this week. The proposals will be circulated to interested parties or "market tested". Under a deal agreed in December, Ryanair has lined up Flybe to operate up to 43 Aer Lingus routes. Separately, British Airways will operate the critical Heathrow to Dublin, Cork and Shannon routes.

Last week's discussions centred on addressing European Commission concerns, including the nonbinding nature of the agreement with Flybe.
The plan will also seek to address concerns over the financial firepower to be deployed behind the planned Flybe
Ireland operations and its lack of brand awareness in the Irish market.

A potentially more serious stumbling block is the so-called article 10 issue. This is the clause in the Aer Lingus articles of association, inserted just before its flotation, which afforded the government's golden share a near-veto on the future transfer of Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots. Under the agreement, any shareholder with a 25.11% stake, the state's holding, can block the "relinquishing" of the slots if it can garner the support of a further 5% of the company shareholders.

Article 10 was central to the European Commission blocking previous Ryanair takeover bids and remains a concern. As reported in The Sunday Times in December, Ryanair has proposed that BA be allowed to operate the routes while the courts decide whether it can legally assign the Heathrow slots without fear of government interference.
Government announced its opposition to the Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus in December.

The European Commission is unlikely to clear the Ryanair and Aer Lingus merger if there is any uncertainty over the Heathrow slots. Speculation on enhanced remedies has driven the Aer Lingus share price to €1.29, just short of Ryanair''s €1.30 per share offer. London market sources suggested an element of hedge-fund activity speculating on a bidding war for the company.
Ryanair last week said it expected its full-year profits to be €540m, ahead of previous guidance of €490m to
€520m. The airline said it was confident the EU would give the go ahead for the bid.

Ryanair Submits  Fresh Remedies to EU
613 words
4 February 2013
20:55
Dow Jones Global News Select
DJON
English
(c) 2013 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
LONDON--Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY, RYA.DB, RYA.LN) has submitted yet another new package of concessions to European Union regulators in a last ditch attempt to secure approval for its bid to acquire rival Irish airline Aer Lingus  PLC (ACSTF, EIL1.DB), people close to the process said on Monday.

The package, submitted to the  European Commission on Friday and subject to board approval, guarantees regional carrier Flybe Group PLC (FLYB.LN) EUR20 million in annual profit from the 43  Aer Lingus  routes it would take over as a sweetener for the deal.  Ryanair would also provide EUR100 million in cash up front for Flybe, two people close to the negotiations said.

Ryanair will also transfer all Aer Lingus' London Gatwick-to-Ireland routes to British Airways, a unit of International Airlines Group SA (ICAGY, IAG.LN, IAG.MC). Under a previous package British Airways would have got the London Heathrow-to-Ireland routes instead.

In June, Ryanair renewed its pursuit of its Irish rival, in which it currently holds a stake of 29.8%, with a EUR694 million ($925 million) offer. The commission threw out an earlier bid saying it would create a monopoly for Irish flights. The Irish government, which has a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, has also come out against the bid.
The Commission has demanded board approval from Ryanair, British Airways and Flybe by close of play
Tuesday. It recently extended the deadline of its review of the merger to March 6.

The commission has already contacted interested parties, and had given them until Thursday evening to send their feedback, as part of its so-called market testing procedure, one of the people said.

The person, who is familiar with the negotiations, said the upgraded offer could still raise many issues for regulators, as it exposed the risks of handing over a large slice of Aer Lingus to Flybe, an airline that has issued several profit warnings over the past two years and which announced last month it would cut its workforce in the U.K.
"With this offer of cash, O'Leary is acknowledging that once he hands over this profile business [Aer Lingus] to
Flybe, it will not longer be profitable and might need to be propped up," the person said.

More broadly, the latest concessions could still fail to address concerns that Flybe cannot become a credible rival, as the regional carrier operates mainly smaller aircraft and, unlike Aer Lingus, operates under a very different business model. "On the routes where they compete directly, Ryanair and Aer Lingus often fight for the same customers, even if they offer a slightly different service," the person explained. "Given the kind of airline it is and the challenges it faces, Flybe may not be seen as a genuine rival."
Last Friday, the commission signalled Ryanair would be given just one last chance to submit a credible package
of concessions. The EU's Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told reporters there was "one more time to
discuss it."

Ryanair said it wouldn't comment until the process was completed. Representatives for IAG and Flybe declined to comment.

It is Ryanair's third attempt to buy the airline in the past six years. The deal is part of the carrier's plans to expand at a time when tough conditions in the European market have led to the collapse of several regional airlines in the face of spending cuts and rising fuel costs.

Ryanair to pay Flybe to take Aer Lingus  routes-source

4 February 2013

English
(c) 2013 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (Reuters) -  Ryanair has offered rival Flybe 100 million euros ($136 million) to take some  Aer   Lingus  routes off its hands, a source close to the deal said on Monday, as the  European Commission prepares
to decide on its 694-million-euro offer for the Irish airline.

Ryanair's latest concession to regulators follows  EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia's comments to Reuters last week that  Europe's top low-cost carrier has one more chance to convince him of the merits of the Aer Lingus  deal.

Ryanair, which is making its third takeover attempt of Aer Lingus, needs to make concessions that would retain healthy competition in air transport from to and from Ireland.

"The 100 million euros is tied to Flybe's performance. If it over performs, Flybe will pay back Ryanair," the source said, adding Ryanair has also offered nine planes to Flybe.

Flybe is a low-cost regional airline group operating over 180 routes to 65 European airports and is Europe's largest regional airline.
The source said Ryanair has also offered Gatwick slots to British Airways on top of Aer Lingus' Heathrow slots. Last month, a source told Reuters that Ryanair's offer to the Commission included ceding 43 routes to Flybe and
three of Aer Lingus' Heathrow routes to British Airways.

The EU antitrust authority asked rivals and interested parties on Monday for feedback on Ryanair's latest concessions, the source said. They have until Thursday to reply.
The Commission has set a March 6 deadline for its decision. ($1 = 0.7376 euros)

LONDON--Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY, RYA.DB, RYA.LN) has submitted yet another new package of concessions to European Union regulators in a last ditch attempt to secure approval for its bid to acquire rival Irish airline Aer Lingus PLC (ACSTF, EIL1.DB), people close to the process said on Monday.

The package, submitted to the European Commission on Friday and subject to board approval, guarantees regional carrier Flybe Group PLC (FLYB.LN) EUR20 million in annual profit from the 43 Aer Lingus routes it would take over as a sweetener for the deal. Ryanair would also provide EUR100 million in cash up front for Flybe, two people close to the negotiations said.

Ryanair will also transfer all Aer Lingus' London Gatwick-to-Ireland routes to British Airways, a unit of International Airlines Group SA (ICAGY, IAG.LN, IAG.MC). Under a previous package British Airways would have got the London Heathrow-to-Ireland routes instead.

In June, Ryanair renewed its pursuit of its Irish rival, in which it currently holds a stake of 29.8%, with a EUR694 million ($925 million) offer. The commission threw out an earlier bid saying it would create a monopoly for Irish flights. The Irish government, which has a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, has also come out against the bid.
The Commission has demanded board approval from Ryanair, British Airways and Flybe by close of play
Tuesday. It recently extended the deadline of its review of the merger to March 6.

The commission has already contacted interested parties, and had given them until Thursday evening to send their feedback, as part of its so-called market testing procedure, one of the people said.

The person, who is familiar with the negotiations, said the upgraded offer could still raise many issues for regulators, as it exposed the risks of handing over a large slice of Aer Lingus to Flybe, an airline that has issued several profit warnings over the past two years and which announced last month it would cut its workforce in the U.K.
"With this offer of cash, O'Leary is acknowledging that once he hands over this profile business [Aer Lingus] to
Flybe, it will not longer be profitable and might need to be propped up," the person said.

More broadly, the latest concessions could still fail to address concerns that Flybe cannot become a credible rival, as the regional carrier operates mainly smaller aircraft and, unlike Aer Lingus, operates under a very different business model. "On the routes where they compete directly, Ryanair and Aer Lingus often fight for the same customers, even if they offer a slightly different service," the person explained. "Given the kind of airline it is and the challenges it faces, Flybe may not be seen as a genuine rival."
Last Friday, the commission signalled Ryanair would be given just one last chance to submit a credible package
of concessions. The EU's Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told reporters there was "one more time to
discuss it."

Ryanair said it wouldn't comment until the process was completed. Representatives for IAG and Flybe declined to comment.

It is Ryanair's third attempt to buy the airline in the past six years. The deal is part of the carrier's plans to expand at a time when tough conditions in the European market have led to the collapse of several regional airlines in the face of spending cuts and rising fuel costs.

LONDON—Ryanair Holdings PLC has submitted yet another package of concessions to European Union regulators in a last-ditch attempt to secure approval for its bid to acquire rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus  Group PLC, people close to the process said on Monday.

The commission, the EU's executive body, threw out an earlier bid, saying a merger would create a monopoly of Irish flights. The Irish government, which has a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, has also come out against the bid.

The commission has demanded board approvals from Ryanair, British Airways and Flybe by Tuesday. It recently extended the deadline of its review of the merger to March 6.

Roundup-Ryanair pulls out all the stops

Ryanair has offered to give British airline Flybe E100 million in cash to help establish an operation in Ireland that could take over 43 routes from  Aer Lingus  as it seeks to gain approval from the  European Commission to acquire its Irish rival.

The routes in question are expected to generate a profit of E20 million for Flybe, according to  Ryanair's submission.
Ryanair has also withdrawn a proposal that British Airways would take over Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots. Instead, BA has agreed to take over Ryanair and Aer Lingus Gatwick slots for flights to Dublin, Cork and
Shannon.This is an important change to the remedies package submitted to the commission. Government veto At
present, the Government, which owns 25.11 per cent of Aer Lingus, could veto a transfer of the Heathrow slots to
British Airways if it were to gain the support of another 5 per cent of shareholders in the former state-owned
airline. This is likely given that Aer Lingus's code-sharing partner Etihad Airways owns just under 3 per cent of the
Irish airline and that pilots and other staff also have significant holdings in the business and are unlikely to sell to
Ryanair. The Irish Times XXXX Ghostly skeletons of large residential estates, half-finished shopping malls, empty
apartment buildings with no windows, serviced by dirt tracks full of potholes. Sound familiar? These images of
half-built luxury ghost developments are known to Irish readers, but they are relatively new in China, where the
property market has slowed significantly since the government introduced cooling measures to stop the boom
turning into a bubble. In places like Ordos in Inner Mongolia, hundreds of projects have ground to a halt after a
building boom fuelled by over-investment went bust, leaving tens of thousands of investors at risk of default. In
the search for options that offer more than the minimal return of a bank deposit book, investors in China have
been piling into investment vehicles known as trusts, which promise high annual interest rates and a return of
principal for people with more than a million yuan (E120,000) to invest. According to Wang Tao, chief China
analyst at UBS, trusts account for more than a quarter of the country's estimated dollar 3.35 trillion (E2.56 trillion)
in non-bank lending, or about 45 per cent of China's gross domestic product. The investment bank Sanford C.
Bernstein Co estimates that shadow finance in China totals about 20 trillion yuan (E2.45 trillion), or a third of the
current size of the bank lending market. Shadow banking in China includes banks' off-balance-sheet vehicles,
such as commercial bills and entrusted loans, as well as underground lending by individual. The reason it is
booming in China is because more than 90 per cent of the nation's 42 million small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) - find it difficult to get bank loans. The Irish Times XXXX Ireland is the "standout" country when it comes
to recovery and may bounce back more quickly than previously expected, rating agency Standard and Poor's has
said in a report "Wage flexibility and investment inflows make Ireland a standout," S and P analyst Frank Gill
wrote in a report on Europe's economies. Highly indebted countries are making faster progress in rebalancing
their economies than the rating agency had previously anticipated, the report says. Rising exports are helping
Ireland, Spain and Portugal, the report concludes. Greece is not benefiting from this trend and has seen exports
fall. Spain and Portugal both saw exports hit record highs last year thanks to demand from China, Brazil, Angola,
Mozambique and the US. Irish exports are close to an all-time high. Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and Greece all
improved their current account positions last year. "For 2013, we forecast that Spain, Portugal and Ireland will
operate outright current account surpluses, potentially enabling them to post an earlier recovery of GDP (gross
domestic product) than we had previously anticipated," the report said. Current account surpluses occur when
countries receive more in payments for selling domestic goods than they do in payments buying imports. S and P
highlighted Ireland's reduction in unit labour costs - with cuts to both public and private sector wages as well as
large-scale job cuts, especially in the construction sector. The report says Spain's unit labour costs also fell but
blamed the decrease on rising unemployment. The rating agency said Ireland and Estonia are both champions
when it comes to attracting foreign investment. The Irish Independent XXXX Dunnes Stores boosted its share of
Ireland's multi-billion-euro grocery market by the most in four years as heavy promotional activity over Christmas
helped it steal a march on its rivals. New data from research group Kantar Worldpanel shows that Dunnes Stores'

Page 37 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
share of the grocery market rose 4.6pc to 24.3pc in the 12 weeks to January 20. Tesco and the
Musgrave-controlled SuperValu and Super-quinn all lost ground in the period. The decline posted by Tesco is the
first time that the retailer has fallen behind the market growth rate since October 2009. In the latest period, the
market growth rate was 0.6pc. Kantar said Tesco could grow its share again by capitalising on shoppers who've
been making more frequent trips to its stores. The performance by Dunnes firmly reverses what had been
previously difficult trading for the family-owned retailer. Generous But retail insiders say the group effectively
"bought Christmas" by rewarding customers with generous vouchers in the run-up to the season. The strategy
worked. Dunnes Stores was the only one of the larger multiples to pick up market share. Tesco's market share fell
1pc to 27.6pc, but it's still the country's biggest grocery retailer. SuperValu's share slipped 0.5pc to 19.8pc while
Superquinn's fell 4.5pc to 5.3pc. Aldi's market share was 5.9pc. Lidl's was virtually unchanged at 5.7pc. David
Berry, commercial director at Kantar Worldpanel, said that shoppers responded well to Dunnes' promotional
'Shop and Save' offer, buying more items when they did shop and increasing the average size of their baskets by
almost E3 to E36.70, a rise of 9pc. The Irish Independent

0950 GMT [Dow Jones] FlyBE Group (FLYB.LN) +2.7% to 47p following confirmation that it is in discussions with Ryanair (RYA.DB) about the possible transfer of a number of aircraft and operating routes. This forms part of Ryanair's efforts to address issues with regards to its offer for  Aer Lingus  Group (EIL1.DB). Also, EUR100M cash will fund initial losses of the operation. "We are worried about Flybe's ability to compete head to head with Ryanair," says Liberum Capital. But Liberum concedes that it has yet to see the full details of the business plan.

0950 GMT [Dow Jones] FlyBE Group (FLYB.LN) +2.7% to 47p following confirmation that it is in discussions with Ryanair (RYA.DB) about the possible transfer of a number of aircraft and operating routes. This forms part of Ryanair's efforts to address issues with regards to its offer for  Aer Lingus  Group (EIL1.DB). Also, EUR100M cash will fund initial losses of the operation. "We are worried about Flybe's ability to compete head to head with Ryanair," says Liberum Capital. But Liberum concedes that it has yet to see the full details of the business plan. Has Flybe at hold. (andrea.tryphonides@dowjones.com Twitter: @ATryphonides)

0946 GMT [Dow Jones] Morgan Stanley upgrades London Mining (LOND.LN) to overweight from equalweight and increases its price target to 230p from 180p. It says London Mining has lagged relative to small-cap iron peers in the recent iron ore price rally, largely on concerns about the company's ability to finance and deliver
expansion at the Marampa mine. However, following a site visit in Sierra Leone, the brokerage is now comfortable enough to incorporate cost-saving initiatives and reduce its perception of risk. London Mining shares are up 2.1% at 167p.(andrea.tryphonides@dowjones.com Twitter: @ATryphonides)

0921 GMT [Dow Jones] Investec Securities places its 900p target price for ARM Holdings (ARM.LN) under review following the company's 4Q results. Sales of $262 million are ahead of Investec's $238 million estimate, driven by
$85.2 million in licences, which is higher than Investec's $72 million forecast. It notes costs are higher than expected, but says this is due to bonuses payable as a result of the sales beat. Pretax profit of $80 million is ahead of Investec's view of $74.3 million. It adds the licence order backlog was up 25% sequentially, which
suggests strong underpinning to future licence revenue. "The key will be on the sustainability of this licence level," it says. Investec rates ARM at hold. Shares are up 3.7% at 925p. (nina.bains@dowjones.com)

0854 GMT [Dow Jones] ARM Holdings' (ARM.LN) fourth-quarter sales and profits beat market expectations and the dividend is also higher than expected, UBS says. Revenue is 8% ahead and Ebit is 6% ahead of market views. Guidance is also solid, with first-quarter sales forecasts ahead by 5% and Ebit ahead by 3%. Licensing for higher-end products and graphics is strong and there is also a strong backlog. UBS has a neutral recommendation on ARM with a 900p target price. Shares are up 4.5% to 932p.(kathy.gordon@dowjones.com)

0837 GMT [Dow Jones] A bid from Liberty Global (LBTYB) for Virgin Media (VMED) would not offer any in-market synergies but would widen their base in Europe says Espirito Santo Investment Bank. Says no valuation has
been mentioned but thinks Virgin Media is undervalued at the current share price, particularly given the scale of its tax assets. Adds that given its relatively high leverage it is unclear how Liberty would finance a bid for Virgin Media. Has no rating on Liberty. Has Virgin at buy with fair value of 3150p. Virgin shares trading in London are up
14% at 2800p. (andrea.tryphonides@dowjones.com Twitter: @ATryphonides)

0821 GMT [Dow Jones] Qinetiq Group's (QQ.LN) 3Q results indicate the performance in UK services has offset weakness in the US says Liberum Capital. Also, notes that cash generation remains strong in the period and as a result, the brokerage increases its FY net cash estimate to GBP66M from GBP59M, versus consensus of GBP44M. Liberum highlights that its forecasts imply a 20%+ EPS decline in 2014 due to a number of known headwinds. Thinks Qinetiq has good earnings momentum but says the valuation looks full relative to peers.
Keeps a hold rating. Shares +0.6% at 199p. (andrea.tryphonides@dowjones.com Twitter: @ATryphonides)

RYANAIR is thought to have offered a gift of €100m to struggling UK airline Flybe if it agrees to take over around
43 Aer Lingus  short-haul routes.

Ryanair desperately needs to share out Aer Lingus  routes with other airlines if it is to convince the authorities in Europe to okay its third bid to buy Aer Lingus.  The two Irish airlines currently control around 80pc of the flights between Ireland and the UK.

To win approval for the takeover, Ryanair has to prove that passengers will have a choice of airlines with a secure future when flying between Ireland and the UK.

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary is racing against time as he tries to cobble together a deal with other airlines to persuade the European Commission to allow Ryanair to take over Aer Lingus. The commission will rule on the takeover next month.

It's believed Ryanair has also offered to lease 10 Aer Lingus aircraft, complete with crew, to Flybe as part of the deal.
Ryanair would forego about €20m of Aer Lingus's pre-tax profits as a result of the deal.

Flybe has previously confirmed it's been in talks with Ryanair regarding the Irish airline's efforts to buy out its smaller rival in a takeover that would value Aer Lingus at €694m.
Ryanair already owns close to 30pc of Aer Lingus and the current effort to secure the green light from the
European Commission's competition watchdog is seen as a final attempt to buy the remainder.

Mr O'Leary has already said he will consider selling his airline's Aer Lingus stake if Ryanair fails this time to persuade the EC that it should be allowed to acquire the former state-owned carrier. Mr O'Leary has warned that Aer Lingus will be split up if Ryanair was to sell its stake in it.

It's also understood that Ryanair retracted an offer it made to British Airways that would have seen it sell a chunk of valuable landing slots at Heathrow. The two airlines had signed a non-binding agreement in relation to a proposed deal. But there was a political and public backlash in Ireland at the notion.
Control The Government subsequently said it would not sell its 25.1pc stake in Aer Lingus to Ryanair.

But under a fresh proposal, British Airways will instead operate flights from London Gatwick to Dublin, Shannon and Cork, and hold an option over the Heathrow slots if Ryanair manages to gain more than 75pc control of Aer Lingus. The Government is able to block any slot transfer as long as it retains its 25.1pc stake in Aer Lingus.
The EU intends to make its decision by March 6. The EU Competition Commissioner Jaoquin Almunia said last
Friday that Ryanair had "one more time" to gain approval.

Ryanair ups ante in Aer Lingus  bid

Ryanair is offering Flybe Group €100m and use of  Aer Lingus’s  brand name for three years in a bid to secure
EU consent to complete its €800m takeover of the national airline.

In a final bid to win  EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia’s approval to take over  Aer Lingus,  Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary is offering unprecedented concessions to secure his plans to purchase the carrier. The commission has set a Mar 6 deadline for its decision.

The Irish Examiner has confirmed that Ryanair is prepared to concede as much as 50% of Aer Lingus’s profitability to Flybe and British Airways.
Ryanair plans to off-load to British Airways all Aer Lingus and Ryanair routes from Gatwick to Ireland, and up to
43 Aer Lingus routes, with 12 aircraft and 1,500 staff to Flyby on other short-haul routes.

Ryanair has battled for almost five years to win control of Aer Lingus, and now, Mr O’Leary’s strategy is raising concerns within Ryanair that the carrier is conceding far too much to take over Aer Lingus.

Ryanair had planned to off-load valuable Heathrow slots to British Airways to appease EU authorities, but this concerned Transport Minister Leo Varadkar, who sees the Heathrow slots as crucial to Ireland’s transport infrastructure.
Under the new strategy, Ryanair will retain ownership of these slots if Aer Lingus is acquired.

The Government owns 25% of Aer Lingus and plans to sell it off as part of a government strategy of divesting state assets. Up to now, the Government has not been prepared to sell to Ryanair, who has a 30% stake in the company.
Ryanair, British Airways, and Flybe would not comment last night.
An analyst with Merrion Capital, David Holohan, who has a "buy" rating on Aer Lingus and a "neutral" rating on
Ryanair said: "The level of concessions being offered now are unprecedented for the industry, without a doubt.
"It shows how committed Ryanair is to doing a deal and willing to do whatever it takes to getting it over the line." Mr O’Leary has said he would like to bring the low- cost model to transatlantic services. An Aer Lingus takeover
would also expose Ryanair to Airbus aircraft and give it leverage when negotiating for planes.

Ryanair proposes €100m Flybe deal.

Ryanair has offered to give British airline Flybe €100 million in cash to help establish an operation in Ireland that could take over 43 routes from  Aer Lingus  as it seeks to gain approval from the  European Commission to acquire its Irish rival.

The routes in question are expected to generate a profit of €20 million for Flybe, according to  Ryanair’s submission.
Ryanair has also withdrawn a proposal that British Airways would take over Aer Lingus’s Heathrow slots. Instead, BA has agreed to take over Ryanair and Aer Lingus Gatwick slots for flights to Dublin, Cork and
Shannon.This is an important change to the remedies package submitted to the commission.
Government veto

At present, the Government, which owns 25.11 per cent of Aer Lingus, could veto a transfer of the Heathrow slots to British Airways if it were to gain the support of another 5 per cent of shareholders in the former state-owned airline.

This is likely given that Aer Lingus’s code-sharing partner Etihad Airways owns just under 3 per cent of the Irish airline and that pilots and other staff also have significant holdings in the business and are unlikely to sell to Ryanair.

The Gatwick solution now offers an alternative remedy to the commission. BA would retain an option to take over the Heathrow slots in the event that Ryanair gains more than 75 per cent control of Aer Lingus at some point.

The commission is expected to market-test Ryanair’s latest remedies this week. It has set March 6th as the deadline for its decision on the takeover proposal.

LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) -  Ryanair has agreed the possibility of transferring some of its routes and aircraft to smaller operator Flybe in order to win the  European Commission's approval for its  Aer Lingus  bid.

Flybe said on Tuesday, in response to press speculation, that  Ryanair had agreed in principle to create a new company, into which business assets, including cash of 100 million euros ($136 million), would be transferred and which Flybe would then acquire.

Reuters reported on Monday that Ryanair had offered Flybe 100 million euros to take some Aer Lingus routes off its hands as the European Commission prepares to decide on the budget carrier's 694 million euro offer for the Irish airline.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, is making its third takeover attempt of Aer Lingus and needs to make concessions that would retain competition in air transport to and from Ireland.
Flybe is a low-cost regional airline group operating over 180 routes to 65 European airports. ($1 = 0.7376 euros) (Reporting by Brenda Goh, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)

5 February 2013 – UK regional airline company Flybe Group Plc (LON:FLYB) announced in a statement today it had agreed in principle to acquire several aircraft and operating routes from Irish peer  Ryanair Holdings Plc (LON:RYA).

The potential transaction, which still needs to be approved by Flybe’s board and shareholders, is part of a package of concessions sent to the European Commission (EC) by Ryanair in an attempt to finally obtain the regulator’s nod for a buyout of rival Aer Lingus  Group Plc (LON:AERL).

The agreement in principle envisages the transfer of the particular business assets and liabilities to a new entity which will then be acquired by Flybe. The company would also receive a payment of EUR100m (USD135.6m) from Ryanair.

So far, European Union (EU) regulators had twice banned Ryanair’s effords to buy the 70% stake it does not already have in Aer Lingus. The latest offer of EUR1.30 per share values the target at EUR694m.

Ryanair's  New Effort For Aer Lingus  Deal
By Marietta Cauchi and Vanessa Mock
590 words
5 February 2013
The Wall Street Journal Europe

English

LONDON -- Ryanair Holdings PLC has submitted yet another package of concessions to European Union regulators in a last-ditch attempt to secure approval for its bid to acquire rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus  Group PLC, people close to the process said on Monday.

The package, submitted to the European Commission Friday and subject to board approval, guarantees regional carrier Flybe Group PLC -- 20 million euros ($27.3 million) in annual profit from the 43 Aer Lingus routes it would take over as a sweetener for the deal. Ryanair would also provide -- 100 million euros in cash up front for Flybe, two people close to the negotiations said.

Ryanair will also transfer all of Aer Lingus's London Gatwick-to-Ireland routes to British Airways, a unit of International Airlines Group SA. Under a previous package, British Airways would have received the London Heathrow-to-Ireland routes.
In June, Ryanair renewed its pursuit of Aer Lingus, in which it currently holds a 29.8% stake, with an offer of --
694 million euros, or $945 million. The commission, the EU's executive body, threw out an earlier bid, saying a
merger would create a monopoly of Irish flights. The Irish government, which has a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, has
also come out against the bid.

The commission has demanded board approvals from Ryanair, British Airways and Flybe by Tuesday. It recently extended the deadline of its review of the merger to March 6.

The commission has already contacted interested parties, and had given them until Thursday evening to send their feedback, as part of its so-called market-testing procedure, one of the people said.

The person, who is familiar with the negotiations, said the upgraded offer could still raise many issues for regulators, as it exposed the risks of handing over a large slice of Aer Lingus to Flybe, an airline that has issued several profit warnings over the past two years and announced last month it would cut its workforce in the U.K.

"With this offer of cash, [Aer Lingus Chief Executive Michael] O'Leary is acknowledging that once he hands over this profile business to Flybe, it will not longer be profitable and might need to be propped up," the person said.

More broadly, the latest concessions could still fail to address concerns that Flybe can't become a credible rival, as the regional carrier operates mainly smaller aircraft and, unlike Aer Lingus, operates under a very different business model. "On the routes where they compete directly, Ryanair and Aer Lingus often fight for the same customers, even if they offer a slightly different service," the person explained. "Given the kind of airline it is and the challenges it faces, Flybe may not be seen as a genuine rival."

Last Friday, the commission signaled Ryanair would be given one last chance to submit a credible package of concessions. The EU's competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, told reporters there was "one more time to discuss it."

Ryanair said it wouldn't comment until the process was completed. Representatives for IAG and Flybe declined to comment.

It is Ryanair's third attempt to buy the airline in the past six years. The deal is part of Ryanair's plans to expand as tough conditions in the European market have led to the collapse of several regional airlines in the face of spending cuts and rising fuel costs.

UPDATE 2-Ryanair seeks binding deals to allay EU on Aer Lingus

* British Airways, Flybe commit to boost competition
* Ryanair asks British Airways, Flybe for binding commitments
* EU indicates Ryanair package likely its last chance
(Adds details, quotes) By Conor Humphries
DUBLIN, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Ryanair is seeking binding commitments from two rivals to compete with it as part of a last-ditch attempt to secure anti-monopoly approval for a takeover of smaller Irish rival Aer Lingus, a source close to the deal said on Tuesday.

British Airways and Flybe have agreed in principle to increase their presence on the Irish market to allay concerns of the European Commission, Europe's anti-monopoly watchdog, but Ryanair is seeking a binding commitment approved by their respective boards, the source said.

The European Commission last week indicated that the package of concessions will be Ryanair's last chance to convince it of the merits of the Aer Lingus deal.
British Airways management has agreed to take over Aer Lingus routes between Dublin and London's Gatwick
Airport, the source said.

Rival Flybe said in a statement that it had committed in principle to setting up an Irish subsidiary, with 100 million euros of capital provided by Ryanair, to take over Aer Lingus routes.

Analysts say the concessions have raised the chance of approval by the European Commission, and Aer Lingus' share price has climbed from 1.10 euro at the start of January to 1.28, just short of the 1.30 euro bid price.
But concerns remain about the strength of Flybe, which has issued profit warnings in recent months and laid off
10 percent of its UK based staff.

Some observers have also questioned the commercial logic for British Airways, which is based in Heathrow, of launching additional capacity from Gatwick.
"If investors were putting on 10 percent probability, now they might be putting on a 30-40 percent probability," a
Dublin-based trader said.

Ryanair had offered to sell Aer Lingus' Heathrow routes to British Airways to allay concerns the merger would curb competition on routes between the United Kingdom and Ireland.

But the fact that Aer Lingus requires the approval of over 75 percent of its shareholders to dispose of Heathrow slots raised concerns in the European Commission about the ability of the merged airline to sell the slots, the source said.
The Irish government, which owns 25 percent of Aer Lingus, has said it opposes Ryanair's bid.

Instead, British Airways will commit to take on Aer Lingus routes between Gatwick Airport and Dublin, with an option to take over the Heathrow routes if Ryanair ultimately secures over 75 percent, the source said.
Page 51 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A spokesman for British Airways declined to comment.
The new Flybe subsidiary would operate 43 routes that are currently worth around 20 million euros in profit to Aer
Lingus each year, the source said.

Ryanair would have no involvement with Flybe after the new venture's creation and will not guarantee its profits, the source said.

Flybe, a low-cost regional airline group operating over 180 routes to 65 European airports, said in a statement that the deal was subject to EU commission approval.

LONDON--Low cost airline Flybe Group PLC (FLYB.LN) said Wednesday it has reached agreement with Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.DB) over the possible transfer of a number of aircraft and operating routes as part of a package of remedies that  Ryanair has submitted to the  European Commission DG Competition, in the context of its offer for  Aer Lingus  Group PLC (EIL1.DB).
MAIN FACTS:

-Proposed transaction is contingent upon the EC's approval of Ryanair's proposed remedies and a successful bid by Ryanair for Aer Lingus.

-If Ryanair's acquisition of Aer Lingus is completed, Flybe expects to seek formal shareholder approval for the acquisition of Flybe Ireland from Ryanair in early Autumn 2013.

-Flybe has received irrevocable acceptances representing 64% of the shareholders in support of this possible transaction.
-Under the deal, Flybe has agreed to acquire a new company, Flybe Ireland, from Ryanair for EUR1 million.
-Prior to its acquisition by Flybe, Ryanair has agreed to transfer to Flybe Ireland:
* 43 routes, all within Europe, many to or from current Flybe destinations;
* The requisite number of slots and licences to operate the routes;
* A minimum of nine Airbus A320 aircraft;
* The requisite number of flight crew, aircraft engineers, management and facilities to operate the business;
* A cash injection of EUR100 million;
* All forward sales cash and liabilities, estimated at a further circa EUR50 million in working capital funding.

-Ryanair in consultation with Flybe will undertake to develop a one year business plan to deliver a cost structure that based on the assumption that the preceding year's revenue remains the same, would provide EUR20 million in pre-tax profits in the 12 months following the transfer to Flybe Ireland.

-Flybe shares closed Tuesday at 45 pence valuing the company at 33.51 million pounds; Ryanair shares closed at 555 cents valuing the company at EUR8.03 billion; Aer Lingus shares closed at 129 cewnts valuing the company at EUR688.91 million.

AIR TRANSPORT : RYANAIR WILLING TO PAY COMPETITOR TO GET AER LINGUS MERGER CLEARED

Ryanair is said to have offered €100 million to Flybe, a British airline, to take over routes that duplicate those operated by Aer Lingus,  with which the Irish carrier hopes to merge. The deal concerns flights to and from Ireland, which it would sell to obtain the  European Commission's green light, as well as the operation of nine aircraft. Reuters reported the story, citing "a source close to the deal". Flybe would pay back the €100 million if the flights prove profitable.

The EU executive opened an in-depth investigation (phase two), on 29 August 2012 (see Europolitics 4475), due to its concerns that the duplication of flights operated by Ryanair and Aer Lingus may shut out real and potential competition on these routes. To address its concerns, Ryanair announced, on 5 November 2012, that it had submitted new "unprecedented remedies". It then revealed that these concessions would enable other airlines to acquire these crossover routes between the two airlines, in return for which it would sell Aer Lingus landing slots at London's Heathrow airport (4521). This aspect interests British Airways.

Flybe confirmed in late January that it was holding "non-exclusive and non-binding" talks with Ryanair (4573). The regional airline operates more than 180 routes to 65 European airports but is in financial difficulty (it has announced a €42.5 million cost-cutting plan and staff cuts). This boost from Ryanair is meant to convince the Commission to consider Flybe a credible competitor.
Ryanair's competitors have until 7 February to submit their views on the concessions proposed by the airline.

Aer Lingus: Flybe deal with Ryanair is 'desperate’ move; Aer Lingus  has accused Flybe of acting out of
“desperation" after the UK regional  airline admitted  it would receive €150m (£129m) to operate 43 of the
Irish carrier’s short-haul routes if it is taken over by Ryanair.

Christoph Mueller, chief executive of  Aer Lingus,  hit out at Flybe for striking a deal with  Ryanair that could lead to the European Commission approving the low-cost carrier’s proposed €694m takeover of its Irish rival.

The EC had expressed concerns that  Ryanair’s proposed €1.30-a-share offer for  Aer Lingus  would create a monopoly on 46 routes out of Ireland.

Ryanair has sought to alleviate those fears by showing that Flybe is willing to set up in competition on most of those routes. It has also held talks with British Airways over operating Aer Lingus routes between Ireland and Gatwick.
Flybe on Wednesday published its plans for a new Irish business, funded by €100m of cash from Ryanair, if the
EC decides next month that it will allow the takeover bid to proceed.

The Exeter-based regional carrier, which is heading towards losses of more than £14m this year, said it would pay €1m for a new company, Flybe Ireland, which would operate half of Aer Lingus’s short-haul routes in Europe and would receive up to 12 Airbus A320 aircraft.

In addition to the €100m of cash, Ryanair has committed to ensuring that Flybe Ireland would receive about €50m in forward sales and would generate €20m of pre-tax profit in the first year.
Flybe has also secured use of the Aer Lingus brand for up to three years.

Mr Mueller said the unusual arrangement appeared “very desperate" on the part of loss-making Flybe, which has issued five profit warnings since its flotation in 2010. “If your back is so much against the wall you grab every straw. I see Flybe as the tool in the hands of Ryanair," the airline boss said.

“They [Ryanair] have found after talking to more than 20 carriers in the last nine months, the weakest of all [which is] in such a desperate need of cash. I believe for Flybe, without exaggerating, it’s a question of survival."

Critics of the deal claimed Flybe could operate successfully in Ireland for the first few years, buoyed by Ryanair’s cash, but said it would struggle to provide effective competition in the long term to the self-styled “ultra low-cost" carrier. Ryanair offers market-beating fares and has the lowest cost base of any airline in the world.

Mr Mueller likened the deal to drug-dealing. “The first shot is for free and then the dependency is there," the Aer Lingus boss said, claiming the competition that would be created through an arrangement between Flybe and Ryanair would be “artificial".

Jim French, chairman and chief executive of Flybe, said his carrier would be able to bring a “different product mix" to the Irish aviation market.

He acknowledged that Ryanair would be a tough competitor but insisted that Flybe would be able to compete by offering more frequent flights on key business routes. The regional carrier has ordered 135 Embraer aircraft – some of which it could deploy to Ireland.

“We have to ensure our ticket price and seat costs are very close to Ryanair so that we can charge a premium, but not a premium that will be unattractive to passengers.

Aer Lingus: Flybe deal with Ryanair is 'desperate’ move; Aer Lingus  has accused Flybe of acting out of
“desperation" after the UK regional  airline admitted  it would receive €150m (£129m) to operate 43 of the
Irish carrier’s short-haul routes if it is taken over by Ryanair.

Christoph Mueller, chief executive of  Aer Lingus,  hit out at Flybe for striking a deal with  Ryanair that could lead to the European Commission approving the low-cost carrier’s proposed €694m takeover of its Irish rival.

The EC had expressed concerns that  Ryanair’s proposed €1.30-a-share offer for  Aer Lingus  would create a monopoly on 46 routes out of Ireland.

Ryanair has sought to alleviate those fears by showing that Flybe is willing to set up in competition on most of those routes. It has also held talks with British Airways over operating Aer Lingus routes between Ireland and Gatwick.
Flybe on Wednesday published its plans for a new Irish business, funded by €100m of cash from Ryanair, if the
EC decides next month that it will allow the takeover bid to proceed.

The Exeter-based regional carrier, which is heading towards losses of more than £14m this year, said it would pay €1m for a new company, Flybe Ireland, which would operate half of Aer Lingus’s short-haul routes in Europe and would receive up to 12 Airbus A320 aircraft.

In addition to the €100m of cash, Ryanair has committed to ensuring that Flybe Ireland would receive about €50m in forward sales and would generate €20m of pre-tax profit in the first year.
Flybe has also secured use of the Aer Lingus brand for up to three years.

Mr Mueller said the unusual arrangement appeared “very desperate" on the part of loss-making Flybe, which has issued five profit warnings since its flotation in 2010. “If your back is so much against the wall you grab every straw. I see Flybe as the tool in the hands of Ryanair," the airline boss said.

Flybe should  be wary of Ryanair's  Trojan horse; How times change. Just a few weeks ago it seemed as
though  it would be third time unlucky for Michael O’Leary, the colourful boss of Ryanair who has been stalking Aer Lingus  since 2006. Virgin Media takeover is good news for Britain

The European Commission, which put a stop to his first tilt at Ireland’s national carrier seven years ago, has never before approved a deal that it had previously blocked on competition grounds. It appears that could now be set to change.

Senior aviation sources, who weeks ago were only willing to offer distant odds that Mr O’Leary would get his way, now believe it’s closer to 50-50 after Flybe emerged as an unlikely saviour.

The loss-making UK carrier has agreed to set up a new airline in Ireland that would take on 43 routes from Aer Lingus and compete head-to-head with Ryanair in return for €150m in cash. Ryanair hopes that the deal, plus a separate route agreement with BA, will be sufficient to convince Brussels that it won’t have a monopoly in Ireland.

Full marks to Mr O’Leary for being inventive. He promised a “radical" set of remedies to alleviate anti-trust concerns and paying a competitor to enter the market certainly fulfills that pledge.
On first sight, it looks as though Flybe has struck the deal of all deals. Flybe would pay Ryanair €1m in return for
a new company that would have €150m cash on its balance sheet, including €50m generated from forward sales.

On closer scrutiny, though, there’s a clear risk that the arrangement could turn out to be a Trojan horse. It is in Ryanair’s interests to play nicely for the first year to ensure the €20m profit goal is achieved. Thereafter, Flybe is on its own against a competitor which has the lowest cost base in the world. And when the gloves come off, Mr O’Leary has a track record of knocking his opponents out cold.

Often, the knee-jerk reaction to a foreign takeover of a UK company is to bemoan the loss of another beacon of British enterprise. But the acquisition of Virgin Media by US media giant Liberty Global might offer a much-needed boost to the British economy.

In the six years after Virgin Media was born out of the NTL and Telewest merger, it made impressive headway in reducing debts and becoming a profitable business, albeit one that was largely run for cash. It signed up 5m customers, invested heavily in its fibre network and battled to close the gap with its major rival, BSkyB. Even so, BSkyB has remained impressively ahead, with nearly 11m subscribers.

However, the Liberty Global deal can give Virgin Media the firepower to take this competition up a level. The company, chaired by John Malone, has the determination and wherewithal to invest heavily in the UK market, creating employment and, potentially, improving service and driving down prices for consumers.

Virgin executives have spent years lobbying for BSkyB to license its content to other players so that they can offer the same flexible service to their customers as BSkyB offers its own. As a major European cable company,
Liberty will have a much bigger lobbying voice than the UK enterprise could ever have hoped for on its own.

A lot of this souped-up competition boils down to a longstanding rivalry between Malone and Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns 39pc of BSkyB. It’s good news that these two men have chosen the UK as their battleground. As long as the world’s media tycoons are slugging it out on British shores, their money will fuel British investment, British jobs and British spending.

Ryanair woos Flybe

RYANAIR has stepped up efforts to gain  European clearance for a takeover of Irish rival  Aer Lingus  at the third attempt after lining up a deal with regional airline Flybe.

It has offered to give Flybe £85million to help establish an Irish operation to take over some of  Aer Lingus's short-haul business in a bid to ease concerns over a lack of competition on routes between the UK and Ireland.

It is believed Flybe would acquire 43 routes from Aer Lingus and more than 10 aircraft. The routes are expected to generate a profit of about €20million for Flybe. Flybe said it had "reached an agreement in principle with Ryanair" about the possible transfer of a number of aircraft and operating routes.
EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said last week that Ryanair, which owns about 30 per cent of Aer
Lingus, has one more chance to convince him over the offer.
Gerald Khoo, airline analyst at Espirito Santo, said: "Ryanair's extensive efforts to overcome the concerns of the
European Commission are increasingly placing the burden on the EC to justify why the deal should be blocked."

Flybe sides with Ryanair to back latest Aer Lingus  bid

AIRLINE Flybe has admitted it has agreed to work with rival Ryanair as its chief executive Michael O'Leary mounts yet another attempt to takeover Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus.

Mr O'Leary made a €694m bid for the 70.2% of  Aer Lingus  which his company doesn't already own in June but needs to satisfy the  European Commission that any takeover wouldn't create a monopoly on flights to and from the Republic.

He's hoping to achieve that by committing to give Flybe 43 of Aer Lingus's routes if a takeover was successful. It's not clear whether this would include any of the routes operated by Aer Lingus from Belfast.

To get agreement from Flybe, he's thought to have guaranteed it €20m a year profit on the routes and an upfront cash payment of €100m.

A statement from Flybe said it had agreed to work with Ryanair in principle but has yet to receive board level approval.

"Flybe confirms that it has reached an agreement in principle with Ryanair about the possible transfer of a number of aircraft and operating routes as part of a package of concessions Ryanair has submitted to the European Commission.
"The agreement provides for a new company to be incorporated into which the relevant business assets
(including cash of €100m) and liabilities would be transferred and which Flybe would then acquire."

Key to whether Mr O'Leary's latest bid for Ryanair is successful is whether the EU consider Flybe a credible competitor, even with the addition with the extra flights.
It's thought this latest bid for Aer Lingus will be Ryanair's last. Document WBEL000020130206e9260000c

Flybe offered multi-million deal as part of Ryanair bid

Flybe has responded to mounting speculation over a 100 million euro deal with  Ryanair, confirming it has come to an "agreement in principle" over the takeover of short-haul routes that will strengthen the Irish operator's 694 million euro bid to acquire  Aer Lingus.  Ryanair has offered the Exeter-based airline a cash consideration worth around £87 million to take on a number of Aer Lingus  aircraft and short haul routes, in order to satisfy competition rules which would also enable Ryanair to focus on long-haul operations. Media reports suggested that if deal goes ahead, Flybe would acquire up to 43 routes from  Aer Lingus  - almost half the Dublin-based carrier''s short-haul network - and more than 10 aircraft and associated crew.

The possible transfer forms part of a package of concessions  Ryanair has submitted to the  European Commission, with a ruling anticipated next month. The concessions are intended to address competition concerns, where a Ryanair merger would create a monopoly.

Aer Lingus has resisted repeated attempts by 30% shareholder Ryanair to engineer a takeover. Ryanair is offering to sell around 40 per cent of Aer Lingus' short-haul operations to Flybe, in a last-ditch attempt to prevent its takeover bid for the Irish flag carrier being blocked by the European Commission.

The outline agreement between Ryanair and Flybe provides for a new company to be incorporated, into which the relevant business assets - including the 100 million euros - and liabilities would be transferred and acquired by Flybe. In a statement issued to the stockmarket yesterday in response to mounting speculation, Flybe said the deal had yet to be approved by its shareholders. It said that any agreement would be dependent on the status of Ryanair''s offer for Aer Lingus; the outcome of the Commission''s deliberations on the competition aspects of Ryanair's bid; and the agreement of a timetable for the implementation of the proposed moves. According to reports, in addition to the Flybe offer, Ryanair would give British Airways, part of International Airlines Group, the right to buy approximately half of Aer Lingus's lucrative Heathrow slots, which are used to provide services to Dublin, Shannon and Cork.

The announcement comes as Flybe plans to shed around 300 staff, including 95 in Exeter, as part of a turnaround plan aimed at returning the airline to profitability.

As part of its blueprint for new business growth, Flybe has formed a new division - Flybe Outsourcing Solutions. It comprises its engineering arm, Flybe Aviation Services, the Flybe Training Academy and the contract flying service it delivers on behalf of other European airlines and will focus on a complete service package to European airlines seeking to focus upon their long-haul operations.
Aer Lingus is due to release its 2012 results today. Document WMN0000020130206e92600027

Aer Lingus  shares hit Ryanair bid price

Aer Lingus  shares rose to E1,30 this morning after a strong set of full year results, reaching  Ryanair's bid price after Ryanair sought to do a deal with two UK rivals to strengthen its chances of winning  EU approval for a takeover.

Ryanair is seeking binding commitments from two rivals to compete with it as part of a last-ditch attempt to secure anti-monopoly approval for a takeover of  Aer Lingus,  a source close to the deal said.

British Airways and Flybe have agreed in principle to increase their presence on the Irish market to allay concerns of the European Commission, Europe's anti-monopoly watchdog, but Ryanair is seeking a binding commitment approved by their respective boards, the source said.

The European Commission last week indicated that the package of concessions will be Ryanair's last chance to convince it of the merits of the Aer Lingus deal. British Airways management has agreed to take over Aer Lingus routes between Dublin and London's Gatwick Airport, the source said. Rival Flybe said in a statement that it had committed in principle to setting up an Irish subsidiary, with 100 million euros of capital provided by Ryanair, to take over Aer Lingus routes. Analysts say the concessions have raised the chance of approval by the European Commission, and Aer Lingus' share price has climbed from E1.10 at the start of January to reach the E1.30 euro bid price this morning. But concerns remain about the strength of Flybe, which has issued profit warnings in recent months and laid off 10 percent of its UK based staff. Some observers have also questioned the commercial logic for British Airways, which is based in Heathrow, of launching additional capacity from Gatwick. "If investors were putting on 10 percent probability, now they might be putting on a 30-40 percent probability," a Dublin-based trader said. Ryanair had offered to sell Aer Lingus' Heathrow routes to British Airways to allay
concerns the merger would curb competition on routes between the United Kingdom and Ireland. But the fact that Aer Lingus requires the approval of over 75 percent of its shareholders to dispose of Heathrow slots raised concerns in the European Commission about the ability of the merged airline to sell the slots, the source said.
The Irish government, which owns 25 percent of Aer Lingus, has said it opposes Ryanair's bid. Instead, British Airways will commit to take on Aer Lingus routes between Gatwick Airport and Dublin, with an option to take over the Heathrow routes if Ryanair ultimately secures over 75 percent, the source said. A spokesman for British Airways declined to comment. The new Flybe subsidiary would operate 43 routes that are currently worth around
20 million euros in profit to Aer Lingus each year, the source said. Ryanair would have no involvement with Flybe after the new venture's creation and will not guarantee its profits, the source said. Flybe, a low-cost regional airline group operating over 180 routes to 65 European airports, said in a statement that the deal was subject to EU commission approval.

Flybe boosts  Ryanair's  Aer Lingus  bid with plan to take on 43 short-haul routes

Airline Flybe boosted  Ryanair's hopes of a takeover of  Aer Lingus  today by agreeing a plan to fly 43 of the Irish carrier's short-haul routes.
The proposal is part of Ryanair's attempt to persuade the  European Commission that its planned €694million
(£596.7million) takeover of Aer Lingus  will not harm competition for Irish passengers.
Under the agreement, Flybe will receive a minimum of nine Airbus A320 aircraft and a cash injection of
€100million (£85.9million) from Ryanair.

The newly created Flybe Ireland will operate from bases in Dublin and Cork, with many of the 34 European destinations served by the 43 routes already used by Flybe's UK business.

Ryanair will give Flybe the right to use the Aer Lingus brand for three years and will develop a business plan that should provide €20million (£17.2million) in pre-tax profits in the 12 months following the transfer.

The deal comes a month before the European Commission is due to give a decision on Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus. Should the budget carrier succeed with its takeover, Flybe Ireland is expected to commence operations in time for the winter season.

Flybe chairman and chief executive Jim French said: 'Flybe would be proud to have the chance to serve the Irish markets, and would be, as we seek to be throughout the rest of Europe, a good employer and corporate citizen.

'However, before Flybe Ireland can come into being there are many hurdles to overcome, not least the EC accepting the remedies offered by Ryanair in its offer to take over Aer Lingus, and then the shareholders of Aer Lingus accepting an offer from Ryanair.'

Exeter-based Flybe, which flies from airports including Bristol, Cardiff, Doncaster, Edinburgh and East Midlands, recently announced plans to slash costs by £35million as it looks to stem recent losses. It has been hit by the high cost of fuel and the impact of air passenger duty hikes.

Flybe lifting off as Ryanair has its third try at Aer Lingus; MARKET ROUND-UP

COULD it really be third time lucky for  Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary? Today Flybe shares took off as it agreed a deal with O'Leary to help him in his third takeover attempt of Irish airline  Aer Lingus.

Flybe soared 6.25p to 51p on news of the plans to create Flybe Ireland with  Ryanair. If  Ryanair's audacious bid goes ahead Flybe will pay Ryanair £865 million for 43  European routes and around nine planes as well as flight crew and staff while Ryanair will put up €100 million (£86 million) for the venture.
The arrangement is part of O'Leary's endeavour to gain European Commission approval for his £600 million Aer
Lingus takeover bid.

A smooth landing for the bid is far from assured. The EC will make a decision on competition issues on March 6. But if the plan does fly the outcome is great for Flybe shareholders.

Investec's experts think the deal "is in keeping with Flybe's long-standing strategy of expanding in a low-risk way to create a European network. If this goes ahead, we'd expect a material increase in the share price." Investec gave Flybe a hold rating and a 68p share price target.

But Flybe's chairman and chief executive Jim French played down the chances and said: "Before Flybe Ireland can come into being, there are many hurdles to overcome, not least the European Commission accepting the remedies offered by Ryanair… and then the shareholders of Aer Lingus accepting an offer from Ryanair."

The EU blocked a Ryanair takeover effort five years ago on the grounds that it would create a monopoly on Irish flights so the Flybe plan goes some way in averting this accusation this time.

Christoph Mueller, chief executive of takeover target Aer Lingus, is certainly not going down without a fight. He said the plan is "not going to fly".

Ryanair's shares, which have their main listing in Dublin, travelled up eight cents to €5.60. Over on the benchmark index retail stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown was top of the tree after reporting strong first-half profits. Its shares added 50p to 784.5p.

It was followed up by Kazakh miner Enrc, which reported iron ore and ferrochrome output was up in its fourth quarter. It was 23.5p better off at 367.9p.
Punters were still willing to overlook bad eurozone news and the outlook was broadly upbeat. The FTSE 100 index put on 26.79 points to 6309.55.
On the mid-cap index, gaming software maker Playtech got a boost from analysts at Deutsche Bank ahead of its fourth-quarter results tomorrow.
Deutsche rates the stock a buy and raised its share price target from 470p to 550p. The shares fluttered up 4p to
484.6p.

Small-cap oil services specialist Lamprell has won a new Singapore contract and its shares gushed up by 11.5p to 146.5p.

The proposal is part of  Ryanair's attempt to persuade the  European Commission that its planned 694 million euro (£596.7 million) takeover of  Aer Lingus  will not harm competition for Irish passengers.

Under the agreement, Flybe will receive a minimum of nine Airbus A320 aircraft and a cash injection of 100 million euros (£85.9 million) from Ryanair.

The newly created Flybe Ireland will operate from bases in Dublin and Cork, with many of the 34 European destinations served by the 43 routes already used by Flybe's UK business.

Ryanair will give Flybe the right to use the Aer Lingus brand for three years and will develop a business plan that should provide 20 million euros (£17.2 million) in pre-tax profits in the 12 months following the transfer.

The deal comes a month before the European Commission is due to give a decision on Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus. Should the budget carrier succeed with its takeover, Flybe Ireland is expected to commence operations in time for the winter season.

Flybe chairman and chief executive Jim French said: "Flybe would be proud to have the chance to serve the Irish markets, and would be, as we seek to be throughout the rest of Europe, a good employer and corporate citizen.

"However, before Flybe Ireland can come into being there are many hurdles to overcome, not least the EC accepting the remedies offered by Ryanair in its offer to take over Aer Lingus, and then the shareholders of Aer Lingus accepting an offer from Ryanair."

Exeter-based Flybe, which flies from airports including Bristol, Cardiff, Doncaster, Edinburgh and East Midlands, recently announced plans to slash costs by £35 million as it looks to stem recent losses. It has been hit by the high cost of fuel and the impact of air passenger duty hikes.

Flybe offered Euros100m to help Ryanair win approval  for Aer Lingus  takeover

Ryanair has offered fellow low-cost airline Flybe Euros100 million (GBP85.8m) in cash to take some routes off its hands if the Irish carrier succeeds in its bid for  Aer Lingus.

Flybe said yesterday that it had reached an agreement, which still needs board and shareholder approval, that would see it take on "a number of aircraft and operating routes as part of a package of concessions  Ryanair has submitted to the  European Commission".

The firm added: "The agreement provides for a new company to be incorporated into which the relevant business assets, including cash of Euros100m, and liabilities would be transferred and which Flybe would then acquire."

Ryanair, headed by chief executive Michael O'Leary, launched its latest Euros694m offer for Aer Lingus in June, having seen two previous approaches fail. The airline has proposed an "unprecedented" package of measures to get the green light from regulators. Among them are a promise to cede 43 routes to Flybe and three Heathrow routes to British Airways, sources said.

Espirito Santo analyst Gerald Khoo said Ryanair's efforts meant the European Commission was coming under increasing pressure to justify why the deal should be blocked.

He added: "We understand the remedies package involves many other airlines committing to compete on routes where a combined Ryanair-Aer Lingus would otherwise have a monopoly. Nothing would happen unless both the EC cleared the deal and Ryanair were to succeed in securing the support of sufficient Aer Lingus shareholders."

(AE) COMPETITION: New Ryanair concessions in Aer Lingus  buy-out

Brussels, 05/02/2013 (Agence Europe) - On Friday 1 February, the low-cost Irish airline, Ryanair, proposed new concessions in order to obtain European Commission approval for buying out its Aer Lingus  competitor, in which it already has a 30% share (see EUROPE 10677). Ryanair is also offering €100 million to the regional British Flybe company if it agrees to take over around 43 Aer Lingus  lines. It may also cede 10  Aer Lingus  planes and crew to Flybe in exchange for the €100 million if the operation is successful. By introducing these concessions, Ryanair is also subsequently renouncing around €20 million in  Aer Lingus  profits, which would go to Flybe. The Irish airline is also proposing to give up three slots to British Airways at Heathrow in order to avoid being labelled “anti-competitive” on flights to Ireland.
The Commission decision is expected on 9 March and the boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, has already said
that in the event of the decision going against his company, Ryanair would sell off its share in Aer Lingus. Several
analysts, however, believe that this third attempt by Ryanair to take control of Aer Lingus will be successful. Last
June, Ryanair proposed to buy up Aer Lingus for €694 million. (FG/transl.fl)

Flybe confirms €100m offer by Ryanair on Aer Lingus  routes;  Deal part of Irish carrier's latest bid to win
over competition tsars

UK AIRLINE Flybe has confirmed it's been offered €100m by  Ryanair as the Irish carrier attempts win over competition tsars in Brussels for its €694m  Aer Lingus  takeover attempt.

Loss-making Flybe said that under the terms of a provisional deal struck with  Ryanair, the Irish carrier would transfer "a number of aircraft and operating routes as part of a package of concessions  Ryanair has submitted to the European Commission".

"The agreement provides for a new company to be incorporated into which the relevant business assets (including cash of €100m) and liabilities would be transferred and which Flybe would then acquire," said the UK carrier.
Flybe would acquire the company at nil cost, with Ryanair stumping up the €100m from its own funds.

It would supply about 10 Aer Lingus-branded aircraft to Flybe, as well as associated crew and cabin staff. Flybe would acquire about 43 short-haul Aer Lingus routes.

The agreement would come into effect if Ryanair was successful in buying Aer Lingus. But Ryanair, which already owns almost 30pc of Aer Lingus, first has to secure approval from the European Commission to buy its smaller rival.

It would then have to persuade enough Aer Lingus shareholders that selling out to Ryanair represents a good deal.

There would likely be immense Aer Lingus shareholder opposition to a Ryanair takeover, especially as Aer Lingus is in better financial and operational shape than it has been for years. The Government, which owns 25.1pc of Aer Lingus, has already said it won't sell to Ryanair.
Aer Lingus releases full-year financial results this morning.

While Flybe would have to obtain the approval of its own shareholders to acquire the Aer Lingus routes, it's unlikely that, with a €100m honey pot from Ryanair, there would be any significant opposition to the deal. It's thought that the Flybe board - which hasn't yet approved it - believes the acquisition of the Aer Lingus routes fits perfectly with its strategy of the airline's continuing development as a regional carrier.

Flotation Shares in Flybe initially jumped over 7pc yesterday on confirmation of the Ryanair talks, but closed down slightly at just under 45p in London. Shares in the carrier have plunged from their £2.95 flotation price in December 2010.

Last month, Flybe announced that it is cutting 300 jobs - or about 10pc of its total workforce - in an effort to cut costs by £35m (€41m).

It also put its 13 UK bases under review. It made a £1.3m loss in the six months to the end of September, compared to a £14.3m profit in the period a year earlier. It blamed high fuel costs and dwindling passenger numbers on the loss.

Yesterday, Ryanair said that its own passenger numbers in January fell by 50,000, or 1pc, to 4.35 million as it grounded about 80 aircraft for the winter.

Desire for Aer Lingus  clear from O'Leary's  bid.
CIARáN HANCOCK
753 words
6 February 2013
The Irish Times
IRTI

English
(c) 2013, The Irish Times.
Ryanair’s latest package of remedies submitted over the weekend to the  European Commission in relation to its
€694 million offer for  Aer Lingus  is unprecedented in terms of aviation takeovers.
It also clearly illustrates the strategic long-term value that Michael O’Leary places on acquiring  Aer Lingus. Ryanair has offered to provide a €100 million, no-strings-attached, cash payment to UK regional carrier Flybe to
capitalise a new business in Ireland that would take over 43 of Aer Lingus’s 90 short-haul routes.

Ryanair has also guaranteed Flybe that the piece of Aer Lingus that it takes over would come with a cost base that would result in a profit of €20 million a year. Ryanair has agreed to hand over the Gatwick-Ireland routes to British Airways rather than the Heathrow slots.

The Government has a near-veto on the use of the Heathrow slots and was not keen on Ryanair’s initial remedy that they be transferred to BA, which already flies the route.

BA would retain an option on the Heathrow slots in the event that Ryanair can persuade the Government and others to allow them be transferred. Either way, whether it is Gatwick or Heathrow, Ryanair is effectively giving away another chunk of Aer Lingus’s profits.
These remedies mean that the cost of buying Aer Lingus in its entirety would top €1 billion. It has already spent €407.2 million on acquiring its 29.8 per cent stake.
Buying the remaining shares would cost it €487 million. To that, you can add in the €100 million payment to Flybe and the profits forgone by giving away half of Aer Lingus’s short-haul routes.

It’s not clear what level of profitability the other half of the business throws off but some analysts suggest it is probably about €30 million.
This would suggest a multiple of 33 times, which is off the radar.

These are rough calculations and Ryanair could get management control of Aer Lingus – it would increase its shareholding to 50.1 per cent – without buying out all of the remaining equity.

That would cost it €108.4 million rather than €487 million and reduce the multiple to 21.2 times, which is still very high. The chunky multiples might suggest why some Ryanair board members and institutional shareholders are said to be questioning whether this deal is now worth doing.
Why is O’Leary prepared to spend all this money to effectively buy half of Aer Lingus’s business? Sturdy balance sheet
Aer Lingus has net cash of €390 million, giving it one of the strongest airline balance sheets in Europe. But that could be significantly reduced to resolve the deficits in the workers’ pension schemes. It has a profitable long-haul business that O’Leary probably feels he can grow successfully.

There is also undoubtedly a significant brand value in Aer Lingus and O’Leary has spoken confidently of growing its operations across Europe.

Page 78 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
You can be sure that O’Leary will also be ruthless in eliminating costs from Aer Lingus while leveraging synergies from joint aircraft orders and delivering other procurement savings.

Perhaps more importantly, acquiring Aer Lingus would give him greater leverage with the Dublin Airport Authority and significant control over Irish skies.
Some wonder whether Flybe has the market power and stamina to be a viable long-term competitor of Ryanair in
Ireland, as Aer Lingus is now. Its market cap yesterday was just £34.25 million and its share price has declined by
15 per cent over the past three months.

Last month it announced plans to lay off 10 per cent of its staff and review its entire network to help achieve cost savings of £35 million by 2015. Brokers estimate its full 2013 losses at anything up to £20 million. It’s no EasyJet.

Who’s to say that Flybe would make a success of flying 43 routes from Ireland? Or that Ryanair wouldn’t simply swat it away after a few years of polite rivalry?

Ryanair could clean up in this market by taking out Aer Lingus. Having failed with two previous offers for Aer Lingus, O’Leary knows this is his last chance to acquire his local rival. The weight of money is still on the commission saying no but O’Leary’s daring remedies have shortened the odds and made the outcome on March
6th less predictable.

By Rhys Jones and Conor Humphries
LONDON/DUBLIN, Feb 6 (Reuters) - British airline Flybe

has agreed to create a new carrier as part of a deal with Ryanair to satisfy regulatory concerns over the Irish carrier's last-ditch bid to take over peer Aer Lingus .

The new carrier, Flybe Ireland, would receive 100 million euros ($135 million) and nine aircraft from Ryanair and commit to operating 43 routes for at least three years if Ryanair's Aer Lingus bid succeeds, Flybe said.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, is making its third attempt to take over smaller Irish rival Aer Lingus and has been told by the European Commission it has one last chance to submit measures to prove the merger will not curb competition.
Ryanair will also provide Flybe Ireland with forward sales cash and liabilities worth around 50 million euros. In return Flybe will pay Ryanair 1 million euros for the newly created airline.
In addition to the Flybe deal, Ryanair will pass Aer Lingus's routes from London's Gatwick Airport to British
Airways , a source close to the talks said.

Flybe said on Wednesday the deal had received "irrevocable acceptances" from 64 percent of shareholders, allowing Ryanair to present it to the European Commission as a binding deal.

"We are not setting up an airline in Dublin as a short-term project. This is a long-term project," Flybe Chief Executive Jim French told a conference call. "Flybe Ireland, if it goes ahead, will be a new, well-capitalized business."
A decision from the European Commission, Europe's anti-monopoly watchdog, is due by March 6.

"This deal is a step in the right direction but considerable issues remain," said Merrion Capital analyst David Holohan, who said the chances of EU approval of the Aer Lingus-Ryanair merger had increased significantly in recent weeks but were no higher than 40-50 percent.
ARTIFICIAL
Ryanair's takeover target Aer Lingus, meanwhile, said it did not expect the Flybe deal to convince the European
Commission that the new airline would be capable of offering serious competition to an enlarged Ryanair.


Page 80 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"This shady deal, where you create an artificial competitor, funded up front... is simply a joke," Aer Lingus Chief Executive Christoph Mueller told Irish state broadcaster RTE after announcing a 40 percent hike in its 2012 operating profit.

"That a weak almost bankrupt carrier is supported to take out a very strong carrier like Aer Lingus... I believe is not going to fly," he said.

Flybe said its main competitive advantage was the ability to introduce high-frequency routes with small planes carrying less than half the 190 carried on Ryanair's Boeing 737s.

Ryanair agreed to give Flybe the right to use the Aer Lingus brand for three years to allay European Commission concerns of Flybe's poor brand recognition in Ireland, he said. If the merger went ahead, Ryanair could also use the Aer Lingus brand for some routes, French said.
Aer Lingus shares have climbed from 1.10 euros at the start of January to 1.30 euros, the level of the Ryanair bid. Shares in Flybe, which have shed about a third of their value in the last year amid profit warnings and lay-offs,
were 20 percent up at 53.7 pence by 1110 GMT.

Aer Lingus  expects  Ryanair's  takeover offer to fail

6 February 2013 - Irish airline  Aer Lingus  Group Plc (LON:AERL) expects the  European Commission (EC) to block rival Ryanair Holdings Plc’s (LON:RYA) EUR694m (USD941.3m) takeover offer, due to competition issues, CEO Christoph Mueller told journalists on Wednesday.

Ryanair proposed to sell some Aer Lingus  routes to UK sector player Flybe Group Plc (LON:FLYB) in an effort to secure clearance from the European regulator. For its part,  Aer Lingus  sees the plan unrealistic, with Mueller saying he very much doubted that Flybe would be an independent competitor to  Ryanair after such a move.
The CEO spoke to journalists after Aer Lingus announced an up to 40% increase in 2013 operating profit to
EUR69.1m, Reuters said.

The EC is expected to give its ruling on the transaction by 6 March. The regulator had expressed concerns that a potential combination of the two airlines which are the main operators out of Dublin airport would eliminate competition on a large number of European routes where the two are each other’s closest competitor.

This offer of EUR1.30 a share made in June 2012 is Ryanair’s third attempt to buy Aer Lingus. The target’s board turned it down. Its first move on Aer Lingus was blocked by the EC in 2007, with the regulator at the time claiming that a merger would create a dominant player on 35 routes to and from Ireland. Ryanair, which holds 29.8% of
Aer Lingus, said back in June 2012 that a deal would support Aer Lingus’ future development and growth.

O'Leary strikes  deal to take to the Aer; NEW CARRIER ON BUYOUT GO-AHEAD

A NEW airline could be cleared for take-off if  Ryanair gets the go ahead to buy  Aer Lingus.
Michael O'Leary has struck a deal with British carrier Flybe to create the new company in a bid to satisfy  EU
competition regulators.
The move would see Flybe Ireland servicing 43 of the former flag carrier's short-haul routes.

The plan is part of Ryanair's attempt to convince the European Commission that its €694million takeover would not lead to higher prices for Irish passengers.
Under the plan Flybe will receive at least nine Airbus A320 aircraft and a cash injection of €100million from
Ryanair.
Aer Lingus claims the plan is doomed as Flybe Ireland will not be an independent airline.

But Mr O'Leary said: "It's a question of spending time trying to tweak the remedies so we ensure we address all the commission's competition concerns and come out with the best deal for Irish consumers and visitors."

Ryanair's biggest obstacle is the risk that its proposed takeover could be blocked by EU competition chiefs. They will make a decision by March 6. The low-cost airline already owns just under 30% of Aer Lingus. The bid is being opposed by Lingus and the Government which owns 25% of the former national carrier. Aer Lingus management said the plan, which would effectively create a new Irish airline, was unrealistic.
Its chief executive Christoph Mueller said: "It seems to me so far fetched we don't bother wasting our time on it. "We question very much that Flybe will be an independent competitor to Ryanair and we are working from the
assumption that we will be around next year when we talk."

Flybe bosses have agreed in principle to set up an Irish subsidiary which would run short-haul routes from Ireland now operated by Aer Lingus.
Separately Ryanair's plan to buy up to 150 Boeing 737's could be signed off within weeks.

Most or all of the aircraft would likely be current generation 737s which would allow Ryanair to secure a significant discount on the asking price.

The newly created Flybe Ireland will operate from bases in Dublin and Cork, with many of the 34 European destinations served by the 43 routes already used by Flybe's UK business.

Ryanair will give Flybe the right to use the Aer Lingus brand for three years and will develop a business plan that should provide 20 million euros (£17.2 million) in pre-tax profits in the 12 months following the transfer.

ow times change. Just a few weeks ago it seemed as though it would be third time unlucky for Michael O'Leary, the colourful boss of  Ryanair who has been stalking  Aer Lingus  since 2006.

The European Commission, which put a stop to his first tilt at Ireland's national carrier seven years ago, has never before approved a deal that it had previously blocked on competition grounds. It appears that could now be set to change.

Senior aviation sources, who weeks ago were only willing to offer distant odds that Mr O'Leary would get his way, now believe it's closer to 50-50 after Flybe emerged as an unlikely saviour.

The loss-making UK carrier has agreed to set up a new airline in Ireland that would take on 43 routes from Aer Lingus and compete head-to-head with Ryanair in return for €150m in cash. Ryanair hopes that the deal, plus a separate route agreement with BA, will be sufficient to convince Brussels that it won't have a monopoly in Ireland.

Full marks to Mr O'Leary for being inventive. He promised a "radical" set of remedies to alleviate anti-trust concerns and paying a competitor to enter the market certainly fulfills that pledge.
On first sight, it looks as though Flybe has struck the deal of all deals. Flybe would pay Ryanair €1m in return for
a new company that would have €150m cash on its balance sheet, including €50m generated from forward sales.

On closer scrutiny, though, there's a clear risk that the arrangement could turn out to be a Trojan horse. It is in Ryanair's interests to play nicely for the first year to ensure the €20m profit goal is achieved. Thereafter, Flybe is on its own against a competitor which has the lowest cost base in the world. And when the gloves come off, Mr O'Leary has a track record of knocking his opponents out cold.

Flybe deal with Ryanair is 'desperate' move, says Aer Lingus

AER LINGUS has accused Flybe of acting out of "desperation" after the UK regional airline admitted it would receive €150m (£129m) to operate 43 of the Irish carrier's short–haul routes if it is taken over by  Ryanair.

Christoph Mueller, chief executive of  Aer Lingus,  hit out at Flybe for striking a deal with  Ryanair that could lead to the European Commission approving the low–cost carrier's proposed €694m takeover of its Irish rival.

The EC had expressed concerns that Ryanair's proposed €1.30–a–share offer for Aer Lingus would create a monopoly on 46 routes out of Ireland.

Ryanair has sought to alleviate those fears by showing that Flybe is willing to set up in competition on most of those routes. It has also held talks with British Airways over operating Aer Lingus routes between Ireland and Gatwick.
Flybe yesterday published its plans for a new Irish business, funded by €100m of cash from Ryanair, if the EC
decides next month that it will allow the takeover bid to proceed.

The Exeter–based regional carrier, which is heading towards losses of more than £14m this year, said it would pay €1m for a new company, Flybe Ireland, which would operate half of Aer Lingus's short–haul routes in Europe and would receive up to 12 Airbus A320 aircraft.

In addition to the €100m of cash, Ryanair has committed to ensuring that Flybe Ireland would receive about €50m in forward sales and would generate €20m of pre–tax profit in the first year.
Flybe has also secured use of the Aer Lingus brand for up to three years.

Mr Mueller said the unusual arrangement appeared "very desperate" on the part of loss–making Flybe, which has issued five profit warnings since its flotation in 2010. "If your back is so much against the wall you grab every straw. I see Flybe as the tool in the hands of Ryanair," the airline boss said.

"They [Ryanair] have found after talking to more than 20 carriers in the last nine months, the weakest of all [which is] in such a desperate need of cash. I believe for Flybe, without exaggerating, it's a question of survival." Critics
of the deal claimed Flybe could operate successfully in Ireland for the first few years, buoyed by Ryanair's cash, but said it would struggle to provide effective competition in the long term to the self–styled "ultra low–cost" carrier. Ryanair offers market–beating fares and has the lowest cost base of any airline in the world.

Mr Mueller likened the deal to drug–dealing. "The first shot is for free and then the dependency is there," the Aer Lingus boss said, claiming the competition that would be created through an arrangement between Flybe and Ryanair would be "artificial".

Jim French, chairman and chief executive of Flybe, said his carrier would be able to bring a "different product mix" to the Irish aviation market.

He acknowledged that Ryanair would be a tough competitor but insisted that Flybe would be able to compete by offering more frequent flights on key business routes. The regional carrier has ordered new Embraer aircraft – some of which it could deploy to Ireland.

Page 90 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Let's be very clear: Ryanair is the lowest cost airline in the world but there are more ways to compete than purely on ticket price," Mr French said, adding that it was not so long ago that Aer Lingus was itself loss–making. "We have to ensure our ticket price and seat costs are very close to Ryanair so that we can charge a premium, but not a premium that will be unattractive to passengers.

"Frequency is our main weapon in our armoury against easyJet, Ryanair and all of the other low–cost airlines we have been competing with for some time."

The EC has until March 6 to rule on Ryanair's proposed takeover of Aer Lingus but senior aviation sources believe a decision will be published in the next 10 days.
Ryanair said it wanted to "respect" the EC's process and would not comment.

FLYBE has agreed a deal with  Ryanair which could see the Exeter-based airline receive around £87m to take over a number of aircraft and routes from Irish flag carrier  Aer Lingus.
Talks have been taking place between the two companies for some time as  Ryanair seeks to overcome the
European Commission's competition concerns surrounding its £600m bid for its rival Irish airline.

In a statement to the stock exchange, Flybe said: "Flybe confirms that it has reached an agreement in principle with Ryanair about the possible transfer of a number of aircraft and operating routes as part of a package of concessions Ryanair has submitted to the European Commission.
"The agreement provides for a new company to be incorporated into which the relevant business assets
(including cash of 100 million euros) and liabilities would be transferred and which Flybe would then acquire." The
agreement still requires the approval of Flybe's board and shareholders, and would depend on the commission's
ruling on Ryanair's bid.

Media reports suggested that if the deal goes ahead, Flybe would acquire 43 routes from Aer Lingus - almost half the Dublin-based carrier's shorthaul network - and more than 10 aircraft and associated crew.
The routes in question are thought to account for about £17m of Aer Lingus' pre-tax ear nings. Flybe shares rose slightly following the news.
It comes as the airline plans to shed around 300 staff, including 95 in Exeter, as part of a turnaround plan aimed at restoring profitability.

Thereafter, Flybe is on its own against a competitor which has the lowest cost base in the world. And when the gloves come off, Mr O’Leary has a track record of knocking his opponents out cold.

Often, the knee-jerk reaction to a foreign takeover of a UK company is to bemoan the loss of another beacon of British enterprise. But the acquisition of Virgin Media by US media giant Liberty Global might offer a much-needed boost to the British economy.

In the six years after Virgin Media was born out of the NTL and Telewest merger, it made impressive headway in reducing debts and becoming a profitable business, albeit one that was largely run for cash. It signed up 5m customers, invested heavily in its fibre network and battled to close the gap with its major rival, BSkyB. Even so, BSkyB has remained impressively ahead, with nearly 11m subscribers.

However, the Liberty Global deal can give Virgin Media the firepower to take this competition up a level. The company, chaired by John Malone, has the determination and wherewithal to invest heavily in the UK market, creating employment and, potentially, improving service and driving down prices for consumers.

Virgin executives have spent years lobbying for BSkyB to license its content to other players so that they can offer the same flexible service to their customers as BSkyB offers its own. As a major European cable company,
Liberty will have a much bigger lobbying voice than the UK enterprise could ever have hoped for on its own.

A lot of this souped-up competition boils down to a longstanding rivalry between Malone and Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns 39pc of BSkyB. It’s good news that these two men have chosen the UK as their battleground. As long as the world’s media tycoons are slugging it out on British shores, their money will fuel British investment, British jobs and British spending.

The proposal is part of Ryanair's attempt to persuade the  European Commission that its planned £596.7m takeover of Aer Lingus  will not harm competition for Irish passengers.

The newly created Flybe Ireland will operate from bases in Dublin and Cork, with many of the 34 European destinations served by the 43 routes already used by Flybe's UK business.

Ryanair will give Flybe the right to use the Aer Lingus brand for three years and will develop a business plan that should provide £17.2m in pre-tax profits in the 12 months following the transfer.
The deal comes a month before the European Commission is due to give a decision on Ryanair's bid for Aer
Lingus.

Should the budget carrier succeed with its takeover, Flybe Ireland is expected to commence operations in time for the winter season. Flybe chairman and chief executive Jim French said his company "would be proud to have the chance to serve the Irish markets" and would be " a good employer and corporate citizen".

"However, before Flybe Ireland can come into being, there are many hurdles to overcome, not least the EC accepting the remedies offered by Ryanair in its offer to take over Aer Lingus, and then the shareholders of Aer Lingus accepting an offer from Ryanair," he added.

Exeter-based Flybe, which flies from airports including Edinburgh and East Midlands, recently said it will cut costs by £35m as it looks to stem recent losses. It has been hit by fuel prices and the impact of passenger duty hikes.

IRISH flag carrier Aer Lingus  yesterday insisted it could survive as an independent company and said the hostile takeover bid from rival Ryanair was unlikely to make it past  European competition authorities.

"It seems to me so farfetched, this proposition, that we don't bother wasting our time on it,"  Aer Lingus  chief executive Christoph Mueller said yesterday as he unveiled a 40 per cent rise in operating profit to €69.1m (£59.7m) for 2012.

Ryanair made its third bid for the company last year, valuing Aer Lingus at €694m. But its deal hinges on offloading some routes to British airline FlyBe to allay competition concerns. The European Commission will decide on the deal by 6 March.

"We question very much that Flybe will be an independent competitor to Ryanair and we are working from the assumption that we will be around next year," added Mueller.

Flybe investors betting  on green light for Ryanair; Analysis

SHARES in Flybe - which have tanked since its flotation in December 2010 - soared over 20pc yesterday as it showcased its deal with  Ryanair. But there remain massive hurdles to the transaction ever happening - not least whether the  European Commission will even sanction an  Aer Lingus  takeover.
It seems like investors are getting very much ahead of themselves in buying into Flybe's stock. Flybe boss Jim
French conceded the deal is contingent on an awful lot else going  Ryanair's way.
The company has received irrevocable acceptances from 64pc of its shareholders approving the deal. "The operative word here is 'possible'," said Mr French yesterday.
He insisted Flybe would have a long-term interest in operating the services and would also boost its presence in
Ireland by bringing in additional aircraft and frequencies.

He also said that the airline - which is Europe's largest regional carrier and operates about 90 aircraft - would engage with the Government to persuade it that it is committed to Ireland. Flybe wants to reduce its dependence on the UK market.

"The terms of the deal negotiated ensure that Flybe Ireland will be a wellcapitalised, well-funded company, enabling us to deliver upon that strategic aim," said Mr French.

But whether the deal structure would attract legal action from disgruntled rivals is anyone's guess. Mr French insists a proposal such as this has already been tried and tested. Flybe acquired British Airway's 'Connect' in
2007, with BA taking a 15pc stake in the smaller airline in return for providing funding.

The cash being provided to Flybe by Ryanair equates to about 2.5 times the smaller airline's market capitalisation as of earlier this week.

Christoph Mueller said that Aer Lingus would be happy to continue competing with Ryanair if its bigger competitor wants to hand it 2.5 times its market capitalisation.
"It would find the full support of the European Commission," he claimed. JOHN MULLIGAN

Aer Lingus  profits soar to €69m despite fuel and airport  costs hike

AER LINGUS has generated its best financial performance since its 2006 stockmarket flotation, delivering a
€69.1m operating profit for 2012 - a near 41pc increase in 2011.
The results - twinned with an 8pc rise in revenue to just under €1.4bn - come as the  European Commission
nears its final decision on whether rival  Ryanair should be allowed to pursue a takeover of its smaller challenger.

Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller said the airline had managed to lure traffic away from bigger rivals including Ryanair and British Airways and that forward bookings for 2013 are so far "very strong".
He added that the results served to validate the carrier's business model.

The results for 2012 were achieved even as Aer Lingus said its fuel bill jumped 24.2pc in 2012 to €358.6m, impacted by currency exchange rates. In dollar terms, fuel costs were 13.4pc higher.

It also saw airport charges rise 7.1pc to €295.3m. Its charges at Dublin Airport, where it's the single biggest operator, were 7pc higher at €92.5m, while at Heathrow they were up almost 12pc to €50.7m.
The airline also said that annual savings achieved under its 'Greenfield' restructuring plan are ahead of target at
€104.2m last year. Just over €62m of that was achieved via staff cost savings.

Extension Speaking to the Irish Independent, Mr Mueller said the firm would have to continue to look for opportunities to control its cost base, especially as largely uncontrollable expenses including fuel and airport charges creep up.

Mr Mueller also said that Aer Lingus has "put skin in the game" by intensifying its relationship with Aer Arann. The smaller airline - now owned by UK transport group Stobart - has inked a 10-year extension to an agreement
where it operates its dozen or so aircraft under the Aer Lingus Regional brand.

Aer Arann has ordered eight aircraft from manufacturer ATR to replace its existing fleet. Aer Lingus has a 33pc stake in a firm that is acquiring the aircraft, which will in turn be leased to Aer Arann.
Aer Lingus has agreed to pay an initial $14.2m (€10.5m) for its stake in the firm and may boost that if a further
two aircraft are acquired. Mr Mueller has always ruled out a direct equity investment in Aer Arann for fear it would
expose itself to increased financial exposure to the operation. He added that a significant proportion of the one
million-plus passengers carried by Aer Arann under the 'Regional' brand last year are now routing through Dublin
to the United States.

Aer Lingus incurred €26.5m in exceptional costs in 2012, which drove its pre-tax profits 52pc lower to €40.6m for the year. Those charges included €10m in professional and legal fees related to its defence of Ryanair's effort to buy the airline. Most of an additional €17.2m charge related to the relocation of an aircraft maintenance operation from Shannon to Dublin.

Business - Flybe could take charge of 43 Ryanair routes

Budget airline Flybe says it will take charge of 43  Ryanair routes should the carrier succeed in taking over  Aer      Lingus.

Ryanair plans a EUR694 million (£597m) takeover of  Aer Lingus  but must convince the  European Commission it would not lead to a monopoly of the Irish airline market.

The Flybe board entered an agreement which would see it receive a minimum of nine Airbus A320 aircraft and a cash injection of EUR100 million (£86m) from Ryanair.

The newly created Flybe Ireland would operate from bases in Dublin and Cork, with many of the 34 European destinations served by the 43 routes already used by Flybe's British business.

Ryanair said it would allow Flybe to use the Aer Lingus brand for three years and would develop a business plan that should provide EUR20m (£17m) in pre-tax profits in the 12 months following the transfer.
The European Commission is set to give its decision on the takeover bid next month.
Flybe said should the deal go through it expects to start using the routes at the beginning of the winter season. "Flybe would be proud to have the chance to serve the Irish markets and would be, as we seek to be throughout
the rest of Europe, a good employer and corporate citizen," its chairman and chief executive Jim French said.

"However, before Flybe Ireland can come into being there are many hurdles to overcome, not least the EC accepting the remedies offered by Ryanair in its offer to take over Aer Lingus and then the shareholders of Aer Lingus accepting an offer from Ryanair."

Exeter-based Flybe flies from airports across Britain and Ireland including Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Doncaster, Edinburgh and the east midlands.
Last month, it announced plans to slash costs by £35m as it looks to stem recent losses. It has been hit by the high cost of fuel and the impact of air passenger duty hikes.
It is understood as many as 20 staff the airline's Belfast operation could go as a result of the move.

Flybe operates to 17 destinations from the George Best City Airport where it has had a presence for 30 years and employs 250 staff.

Support and production roles such as human resources and IT will be affected by the jobs cull while around a fifth of its management team is being cut.
Ryanair, meanwhile, last week reported a 15 per cent rice is revenues in the three months to the end of
December.

It now expects profits of around EUR540m (£466m) in the year to March, which would represent a seven per cent increase on last year's performance.
Ryanair also increased its full-year profits guidance in November to between EUR490m (£423m) and EUR520m
(£449m), up from EUR400m (£345m) to EUR440m (£380m) previously forecast.

AIRLINE ANNOUNCES JUMP IN REVENUES
Irish carrier Aer Lingus has announced an eight per cent jump in revenues after a record year for passengers. Revenue for 2012 was just shy of EUR1.4billion (£1.2bn), however the firm's pre-tax profits fell by more than a
half to less than EUR41bn (£35bn) from more than EUR84bn (£73bn) in 2011.

Aer Lingus put the drop down to restructuring its Shannon aircraft maintenance operations and legal fees incurred from the Ryanair takeover bid.

It is also followed a year in which it made "exception gains" by surrendering its lease of it Dublin Airport headquarters. The airline said it had 10.8m passengers during the year, the highest number on record,

The board is recommending an increased dividend of four cent per share, which follows a three cent per share dividend paid in 2011.

The group's chief executive Christoph Mueller said the result, "representing our third consecutive year of profitability, validates our value carrier business model and shows that our strategy is delivering a leaner, more efficient and profitable carrier, to the benefit of customers, shareholders and staff".

Flybe deal with Ryanair over Aer Lingus  routes.

Flybe's chief executive Jim French has said it intends to establish a "viable business" in Ireland if the  European
Commission clears Ryanair to take over  Aer Lingus.

"Our objective is to provide a long-term sustainable business," Mr French said yesterday. "This is a long-term project we are working on."

He dismissed suggestions from Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller that Flybe was an airline with significant financial difficulties. He noted how it was Europe's largest regional airline and the biggest in the UK outside of London.
Flybe is loss-making and has announced a major restructuring for its core British operation.
'A bit cruel'

"I think he's been a bit cruel," Mr French said. "It's only four years ago that Aer Lingus sent a team into Flybe to understand our business." He added that Flybe would be profitable again next year.
Mr Mueller said the plan was "flawed" and would "not benefit the Irish travelling public".

Flybe confirmed yesterday that it had reached agreement with Ryanair to acquire half of Aer Lingus's short-haul business. This is part of a package of remedies that Ryanair has submitted to the European Commission to win approval for a takeover of Aer Lingus.
The deal with Ryanair would involve Flybe acquiring a new entity called Flybe Ireland from Ryanair for €1 million. Flybe Ireland would have transferred to it the requisite number of slots and licences to operate 43 of Aer Lingus's
short-haul routes from Ireland.

It would also have a minimum of nine Airbus A320 aircraft, and the required number of flight crew, aircraft engineers, management and facilities to operate the business.
Cash injection

Ryanair would provide it with a cash injection of €100 million and all forward sales cash and liabilities, estimated at about €50 million in working capital funding. Ryanair has also agreed to provide Flybe Ireland with a cost structure to deliver a pre-tax profit of €20 million in year one.

Flybe has undertaken to the European Commission to operate these routes for three years and will pay compensation if it fails to honour this obligation.

The UK airline said it has received irrevocable acceptances from 64 per cent of shareholders in support of the deal.

When asked what was to stop Ryanair from attacking Flybe's new Irish operation following a cooling-off period after the takeover, Mr French said: "If Michael [ O'Leary] were to do anything reckless, I suspect the European bodies would be keeping a very close watch on him."

Flybe, Ryanair ink deal on routes transfer

7 February 2013 – UK regional airline company Flybe Group Plc (LON:FLYB) said it had signed a deal under which it would acquire several aircraft and operating routes from Irish peer  Ryanair Holdings Plc (LON:RYA), if the latter manages to successfully take over its rival  Aer Lingus  Group Plc (LON:AERL).
The planned transaction is part of a package of concessions sent to the  European Commission (EC) by Ryanair
in an attempt to finally obtain the regulator’s nod for its  Aer Lingus  buyout.
As part of the deal, Ryanair would form a new company, to be known as Flybe Ireland, and transfer to it a total of
43 European routes along with requisite number of slots and licences to operate them. In addition, the Irish
company would contribute at least nine Airbus A320 aircraft and inject EUR100m (USD135.3m) in cash. In turn,
Flybe will acquire the new company for EUR1m.

The move will only be carried out in the event that the EC clears Ryanair’s bid for Aer Lingus by 6 March 2013 and the transaction is completed in May. On the other hand, the Flybe Ireland deal is seen to close in October, after its potential buyer conducts due diligence and posts a circular to its own stockholders for approval. Flybe noted it has already received irrevocable acceptances representing 64% of the shareholders.

Yesterday, however, Aer Lingus’s CEO Christoph Mueller told journalists he expects the EC to once again block Ryanair’s takeover offer despite the proposed remedies. According to him, it is doubtful whether Flybe would be an independent competitor to Ryanair after such a move.

So far, European Union (EU) regulators had banned twice Ryanair’s effords to buy the 70% stake it does not already have in Aer Lingus. The latest offer of EUR1.30 per share values the target at EUR694m.

As part of the deal,  Ryanair will transfer 43 short-haul routes to the new carrier, along with nine Airbus A320s and a £85.9million cash injection as it tries to convince the  European Commission that the  Aer Lingus  deal wouldn't kill off competition in Ireland.

Ryanair may have to raise bid as Aer Lingus  shares trade at €1.41

INVESTORS are betting that  Ryanair will be forced to up its €694m bid for  Aer Lingus  in the event it secures approval from the  European Commission to go ahead with a takeover attempt.

Aer Lingus  shares touched €1.41 in Dublin yesterday - higher than the €1.30  Ryanair offered last year and the
€1.40 it offered in its second takeover attempt in 2008.

Ryanair tabled €1.30 per Aer Lingus share last summer to buy its rival in a deal that would value the smaller carrier at €694m. Ryanair already owns close to 30pc of Aer Lingus. The Government has already said it won''t sell its 25.1pc holding in Aer Lingus to Ryanair.

But shares in Aer Lingus closed up more than 5.7pc yesterday in Dublin at €1.37, giving the airline a market capitalisation of €726m.

Good shape Having released strong full-year results this week, Aer Lingus is in good financial shape. Investors clearly believe that Ryanair has undervalued the business.

Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller also said this week that the bid undervalues the carrier. He and his board have already rejected the latest approach, which was made last summer.

That offer has lapsed under takeover rules as the European Commission considers whether or not to sanction a takeover of Aer Lingus. But Mr O''Leary has already said that if Ryanair makes a fresh offer for Aer Lingus, pending approval from the EU, that the new offer will not exceed the €1.30 per share already tabled.

"We believe that Ryanair''s offer of €1.30 now offers Aer Lingus' ' long-suffering shareholders a real and meaningful return," Mr O''Leary said last summer as he launched the third bid for Aer Lingus.

Aer Lingus floated its shares on the stock market in 2006 at €2.20. In its first bid that year, Ryanair offered €2.80 per share. The second Ryanair bid, in 2008, valued Aer Lingus at €748m based on an offer of €1.40 per share.
Ryanair has proposed what Mr O''Leary has described as a "radical" remedy package to the European
Commission in an effort to persuade competition regulators to allow a takeover.

Aer Lingus  CEO - we’re worth more; Aer Lingus  could be worth more than €850m (£719m) if it remains

A decision on whether a  takeover of Aer Lingus   by Ryanair would be anti-competitive is expected well ahead of a March 6 deadline, after details last week emerged of the low-cost carrier’s final remedy proposals.
Christoph Mueller, chief executive of  Aer Lingus,  remains hopeful the  European Commission will apply
“common sense" and block  Ryanair’s third attempt to take over its Irish rival.

The aviation veteran believes a plan published last week for Flybe to take over 43 of Aer Lingus’s short-haul flights in return for €150m of cash from Ryanair would not provide “independent competition" within the Irish market.

The EC believes Ryanair would have a monopoly on 46 routes should it be allowed to proceed with its €1.30 a share bid – a concern Europe’s biggest low-cost carrier has sought to alleviate by  striking a deal with Flybe and British Airways owner, International Airlines Group.

IAG has held discussions with Ryanair over routes between Ireland and Gatwick, which could potentially be exchanged for Aer Lingus’s Heathrow slots at a later date.
“The competition which is initiated there is not independent," Mr Mueller said during a visit to London last week. Shares in Aer Lingus closed on Friday at €1.40 a share, valuing the company at €742.13m. The shares have
gained more than 20pc in the past month.

“In the very unlikely case that they [Ryanair] will be successful, of course the share price [at] which the shares will trade will be so much higher," Mr Mueller said.

“But even if we stay independent, we are good for a share price, let’s say €1.50/€1.60 on earning potential and we have this huge cash pile which needs to be finally redistributed if we don’t invest that," he added.
At a share price of €1.60, Aer Lingus would be worth more than €850m.

Analysts said last week that Ryanair’s bid for Aer Lingus, its third since 2006, appeared to be gaining “unexpected traction" after Flybe published proposals to buy a company from Ryanair with up to 12 planes and rights to fly 43
of Aer Lingus’s routes for €1m.

The new company, Flybe Ireland, would be capitalised with €150m cash, €50m of which would come from forward sales, and Ryanair would commit to ensure the company made €20m of pre-tax profits in its first year.
Mr Mueller last week slammed the plan as “desperate" on the part of loss-making Flybe . But Jim French, the UK
regional carrier’s boss, has insisted

it would be able to offer a viable competitor to Ryanair in the Irish aviation market by offering better frequencies on key routes and offering a “different product mix".

Flybe's Ryanair sweeteners  are not to Mueller's  taste
750 words

Jim French is a rare beast. The Flybe chief executive is one of the few  European airline chiefs who can claim he has turned the screw on Michael O'Leary. At least for now.

The Ryanair boss was far from happy with the concessions he found himself offering Flybe to entice it to become a key part of his strategy to take over  Aer Lingus,  said French. Expletives were used across the negotiating
table, he added.

By his own account, French played hardball -- but, in reality, he almost certainly could not believe his luck when O'Leary phoned him months ago. O'Leary eventually offered a deal that could see the British regional airline handed 43 of Aer Lingus's 90 short-haul routes, as well as €100 million in cash. If the deal goes through, it will expand Flybe by a third and make it a key player in Ireland.

But if Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller is to be believed, Flybe is a mere pawn in Michael O'Leary's game to take over Aer Lingus. Mueller was also less than complimentary about Flybe's financial capability to block an eventual Ryanair monopoly in the Irish market.

Mueller said Flybe had serious financial difficulties, pointing to a series of profit warnings and a restructuring that will see 300 staff axed.

"Christoph Mueller said some rather unnecessary and rash things about us during the week," said French, adding that it may be a sign that the Aer Lingus boss is worried.

French pointed out that Flybe made a profit in seven of the last nine years and its loss this year is 2.5 per cent of turnover, compared to the 15 per cent of turnover loss Aer Lingus posted three years ago.
"We chose to use our cash to pay off all debt and pension liability," he said. "Our pension is in surplus.

"It is very unfair for Mueller to effectively say: 'We're sitting here with this bloody great pension debt, but let's forget that exists and we'll compare apples with oranges'."”
Flybe's recent difficulties stemmed from unexpected weakness in the British economy, said French.

"Our financial performance wasn't what was expected. But is that different from anyone else? If our shareholders believed we had been in any way reckless with the money do you really think they would have allowed us to move forward on FlyBe Ireland? Of course not," he said.

The insurance policy for French and his shareholders is the €100 million Ryanair would give Flybe Ireland to ensure its sustainability during what doubtless would prove a difficult transition period.
"Flybe Ireland would be a proud Irish company but we are realistic about how strong a brand Aer Lingus is in
Ireland," said French.

Nevertheless, Ryanair has given him an undertaking that it will hand over the new airline with a cost structure that would deliver an annual profit before tax of €20 million.

"If Ryanair cannot deliver that cost structure -- and we believe they can, given their history -- but if they can't, they will top up the original €100 million payment by twice whatever the shortfall is. So we get full cost protection for two years as well as €100 million in revenue protection," said French.

Of course, eventually the new Irish-based airline would have to face head-on its greatest challenge -- the full force of competition from an expanded Ryanair.

"Our costs will be higher than Ryanair's, we know that. But we know our costs are lower than Aer Lingus because of discussions we had some years back. We will be slightly more expensive than Ryanair but will offer a service that is different enough to mean price won't be a deterrent."”

French believes that Flybe Ireland can operate a higher frequency on key routes by using a mix of Flybe's own existing 88-seat Embraer aircraft and the at least nine 180-seat Aer Lingus Airbus A320s it would receive as part of the deal. He believes Dublin provides enormous opportunities as a hub in this regard.

He also sees opportunities for the wider Flybe group to develop the leisure market based on Aer Lingus's expertise to destinations such as the Canaries.

But French knows, too, that his best-laid plans lie in the hands of Europe's competition authorities. And there his powers of prediction fail him.

Flybegorrah, Frankenstein's monster  airline;  AGENDA

It was hard not to nod furiously in agreement with the  Aer Lingus  chief executive Christoph Mueller as he dismissed Ryanair's latest attempt to get  European Union approval for its bid to buy his airline. Mueller said the planned injection of €100m into a newly established rival, Flybe Ireland, a subsidiary of Flybe plc, was a "desperate" measure.  Ryanair will not just fund the new carrier, it will also provide the aircraft, a cost base capable of delivering €20m in profit, and for a period of three years, lease the  Aer Lingus  brand.

As rabbits from a hat come, this one was big, not very fluffy and with a flaming great bolt through its neck. Flybegorrah is a Frankenstein creation.

It seems that the Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary spoke to 20 airlines in Europe and the only one he could convince to back him had to be propped up with Ryanair's cash, expertise and its rival's brand.

In a further act of "desperation", Ryanair says it will hive off the Gatwick-Ireland routes to BA, to lessen the merged Aer Lingus-Ryanair dominance on Dublin-London. BA will also retain an option over the Heathrow slots, its primary interest.
All this will hollow Aer Lingus into a shell earning €25m to €30m a year.

For Mueller, it boils down to one simple question: how can Ryanair's plan to emasculate a perfectly healthy rival really promote competition? Of course, far from emasculating Aer Lingus, O'Leary says that he is saving the airline and to a degree, Aer Lingus's own numbers back his argument. Yes, the airline delivered a 40% increase in operating profits to €69m in 2012 but this was on the back of its Greenfield cost-cutting plan.

Short haul passenger growth was an anaemic 0.7%. All the growth in passengers last year was delivered on transatlantic, up 9% with revenues rising 19%. Aer Lingus is no stranger to approaching European airlines and getting the brushoff. It sought a white knight to rebuff O'Leary repeatedly over the last few years. Nobody would touch it.

As for propping up partners, Aer Lingus has agreed to invest up to $17m (€12.7m) in a leasing joint venture which will secure aircraft on commercial terms for Aer Arann, the operator of Aer Lingus's UK regional routes.
Mueller always contended that the Aer Arann relationship would not cost Aer Lingus a cent.

Mueller has done a first-class job taking the fat off the airline, but Aer Lingus lacks a discernible growth strategy. Its deal to operate routes to Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow for Virgin in the UK is not too dissimilar to what Aer Arann does for it. It is hardly the height of ambition.

Otherwise Mueller has no plans to move Aer Lingus away from shipping passengers into and out of Ireland. In his time, Mueller has shrunk Aer Lingus, prudently so. He has no intention of chasing or stimulating demand.

O'Leary believes that he can make Aer Lingus a real rival to Easyjet right across Europe, leveraging the brand and operating services into leading airports across Europe and substantially expanding transatlantic services.

Interestingly, all the forces that have rallied to oppose the Ryanair takeover, from the Dublin Airport Authority to the hotel sector and government, are quite happy for Aer Lingus to continue in this self-limiting Ireland focus.

Page 116 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
O'Leary is betting that the EU might just take a broader view of European industry consolidation. Investors, worried about future growth prospects, may also be happy to sell into his offer.

Aer Lingus shares closed at €1.37 on Friday, 7c over the Ryanair offer, so investors are either betting on an improved offer or most likely, somebody is amassing shares to block O'Leary.

The European Commission's sole concern is competition. It is hard to see Joaquin Almunia backing a new greenfield operation of such artificial construct over an independent, well-funded profitable carrier, with a heritage stretching back 77 years, albeit with a few bumps along the way.
Frankenstein created a scary monster, but it did get whacked in the end.

Elan's bitter pill On a conference call last week, G Kelly Martin, the Elan chief executive, took grave exception to the notion that, with $3.25bn coming from the sale of Tysabri to its partner Biogen, he might move to break the company up and actually put some cash in shareholders' pockets.

After the deal, Elan will still earn hefty royalties from Tysabri, its only drug in production. The royalties stream could be worth a further $2.7bn if sold.

With Tysabri gone, one analyst mused, Elan will go from a one-trick pony to a no-trick pony. Why not call it a day? Martin deserves considerable credit for his job in tidying up Elan. Selling its Alzheimer's drug programme and
drug delivery business yielded cash to bring down debt. When he took over Elan, its market capitalisation had slumped to a couple of hundred million dollars. It is now worth $7bn.

Yet it has been a long and eventful journey, and not one many investors will want to repeat. It was an overzealous and ill-focused acquisition spree that landed Elan in the mess that heralded Martin's arrival a decade ago. By the same token, the highly valuable Tysabri was acquired in that same buying spree by Martin's predecessors.
Elan is now a classic investment shell. It has $3.25bn to deploy, an income stream from the royalties of about
$200m a year, $4bn in tax losses and a very favourable tax regime.

Davy, the stockbroker, believes that Martin will move to deploy some of the Tysabri cash sooner rather than later, and while Martin will give cash back to investors — it has approval to buy back 15% of stock — there will be no bonanza.
But spare us the righteous indignation.

After all, Martin agreed in 2010 to ride into the sunset last summer, a decade after first joining. A Merrill Lynch deal maker by background, the temptation has clearly proved too much. Elan shares fell 8% after last week's announcement. Clearly some shareholders don't have the stomach for the ride.

RYANAIR has a greater than 50:50 chance of success in its €694m bid for  Aer Lingus,  Willie Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines Group (IAG) and former  Aer Lingus  chief, believes.

Walsh said yesterday that  Ryanair's chances of obtaining  EU clearance to buy Aer Lingus  had "significantly improved" after  Ryanair last week outlined new remedies to address competition concerns.
Ryanair is proposing to invest €100m in a venture with Flybe, the British airline, which would take over half of Aer
Lingus's short haul routes.

Walsh, who ran Aer Lingus from 2001 to 2005, said the latest competition remedies outlined by Ryanair "do address all of the competition concerns that the [European] Commission has identified". He said it was "clearly going to be a challenge" for Aer Lingus to remain as a standalone airline.

"The odds [of Ryanair's bid succeeding] have certainly increased beyond 50:50, whereas if you had asked me three months ago, I would have said less than 10% chance of success," he told The Business show on RTE Radio 1. If the bid was successful, it would be "pretty sensible" for Ryanair to keep both the Ryanair and Aer Lingus names and run "multiple brands", he said. "It's exactly what we [IAG] do and what other airlines do today," he said.

Christoph Mueller, the Aer Lingus chief executive, said Ryanair's proposed deal with Flybe was "not going to fly". Aer Lingus last week reported a €69m profit for 2012 but Walsh said its profits were "still below what the industry would like".

Aer Lingus  CEO - we're worth more

AER LINGUS could be worth more than €850m (£719m) if it remains independent, the airline's chief has suggested, as  European competition authorities prepare to rule on  Ryanair's €694m bid for Ireland's national carrier.

A decision on whether a takeover of  Aer Lingus  by Ryanair would be anti-competitive is expected well ahead of a March 6 deadline, after details last week emerged of the low-cost carrier's final remedy proposals.

Christoph Mueller, chief executive of Aer Lingus, remains hopeful the European Commission will apply "common sense" and block Ryanair's third attempt to take over its Irish rival.

The aviation veteran believes a plan published last week for Flybe to take over 43 of Aer Lingus's short-haul flights in return for €150m of cash from Ryanair would not provide "independent competition" within the Irish market.

The EC believes Ryanair would have a monopoly on 46 routes should it be allowed to proceed with its €1.30 a share bid - a concern Europe's biggest low-cost carrier has sought to alleviate by striking a deal with Flybe and British Airways owner, International Airlines Group.

IAG has held discussions with Ryanair over routes between Ireland and Gatwick, which could potentially be exchanged for Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots at a later date.
"The competition which is initiated there is not independent," Mr Mueller said during a visit to London last week. Shares in Aer Lingus closed on Friday at €1.40 a share, valuing the company at €742.13m. The shares have
gained more than 20pc in the past month.

"In the very unlikely case that they [Ryanair] will be successful, of course the share price [at] which the shares will trade will be so much higher," Mr Mueller said.

"But even if we stay independent, we are good for a share price, let's say €1.50/€1.60 on earning potential and we have this huge cash pile which needs to be finally redistributed if we don't invest that," he added.
At a share price of €1.60, Aer Lingus would be worth more than €850m.

Analysts said last week that Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus, its third since 2006, appeared to be gaining "unexpected traction" after Flybe published proposals to buy a company from Ryanair with up to 12 planes and rights to fly 43
of Aer Lingus's routes for €1m.

The new company, Flybe Ireland, would be capitalised with €150m cash, €50m of which would come from forward sales, and Ryanair would commit to ensure the company made €20m of pre-tax profits in its first year.

Mr Mueller last week slammed the plan as "desperate" on the part of loss-making Flybe. But Jim French, the UK regional carrier's boss, has insisted it would be able to offer a viable competitor to Ryanair in the Irish aviation market by offering better frequencies on key routes and offering a "different product mix".

Creighton has concerns over Ryanair bid as decision looms

EUROPE Minister Lucinda Creighton expressed concerns about  Ryanair's bid for  Aer Lingus  as the battle for control of the country's second-largest airline entered its final stages.

Her comments came as Aer Lingus  boss Christoph Mueller was quoted as saying that  Aer Lingus  was worth around €150m more than Ryanair's offer of €694m.
The European Commission must decide on Ryanair's bid by March 6, but a decision could be made sooner. While Mr Mueller continues to resist the takeover bid, former Aer Lingus chief executive Willie Walsh said on
Saturday that it should be allowed to go ahead.

Mr Walsh, who is chief executive of British Airways owner IAG, said the global airline industry needs to consolidate. He added that the State is against the Ryanair bid for "purely emotional, not rational" reasons. The Government has said it won't sell its 25pc stake even if Ryanair gets the green light to buy Aer Lingus. Mr Walsh added that he believes Ryanair has a better than 50-50 chance to success.

The IAG boss has agreed to offer extra routes between Ireland and the UK if the deal goes ahead. His comments, and the deal, are part of a gradual thawing of relations with Mr O'Leary. Mr Walsh said late last year about Mr O'Leary that: "I don't agree with everything he does and says, but I don't think you can take away the achievements he and Ryanair have had in terms of financial performance. He's demonstrated that you can be profitable in this industry even in a downturn."

" It emerged yesterday that US Airways Group and AMR are nearing an $11bn (€8.2bn) merger that would create the world's largest airline and could announce a deal within a week, after resolving key differences on valuation and management structure.
Sources told Reuters that a deal that was still being finalised would make US Airways chief executive Doug
Parker chief executive of the new airline while AMR''s Tom Horton would serve as non-executive chairman.
The deal would come more than 14 months after the parent of American Airlines filed for bankruptcy in November
2011, and would mark the last combination of legacy US carriers, following the Delta-Northwest and
United-Continental mergers.
The merger is expected to value the combined carrier at between $10.5bn and $11bn (€7.8bn-€8.2bn). AMR
creditors would own 72pc of the new company, with US Airways shareholders owning the rest.
The board of each airline is expected to meet in the middle of the coming week to vote. Document IINM000020130211e92b00036

The ISEQ slipped marginally in to the red and below the 3,600 level this morning led by  Ryanair and Aer Lingus as the clock ticks on  EU approval for Ryanair's latest bid for its rival at E1.30 a share while Smurfit Kappa was hit by Venezuela's devaluation
By 12:30, the index was down 6.47 points to 3,599.77.
Jim French, chief executive of British airline, Flybe, is in Dublin today to sell the deal announced last week with
Ryanair to create a new carrier as part of a deal with Ryanair to satisfy regulatory concerns over Ryanair's
last-ditch bid for Aer Lingus. He has pledged to develop more flights between Ireland and the UK if the European
Commission gives the go-ahead. Under the deal with Ryanair, the new carrier, Flybe Ireland, would receive E100
million and nine aircraft from Ryanair and commit to operating 43 routes for at least three years if Ryanair's Aer
Lingus bid succeeds, he said. Shares in Ryanair fell 7c to E5.68 while Aer Lingus stocks dropped 2c to E1.35.

Smurfit Kappa's stocks declined 23c to E10.85. Following an announcement by the Venezuelan government on Friday that it is devaluing the Bolivar by 32pc, Smurfit Kappa has today notified the market of the impact on its operations. Firstly, group net assets will be reduced by 6pc or E142m and cash balances in euro terms will decline by E29m (6pc of group cash balances). We estimate that the devaluation will impact Group EBITDA by
1-2pc in FY13, which is consistent with management comments that it will not be material. "The potential for such a devaluation was well flagged by management in the FY12 results last week and thus should not come as a great surprise to the market. We continue to favour Smurfit Kappa given its undemanding valuation and upside potential to forecasts from a favourable pricing cycle. We reiterate our BUY recommendation," said Goodbody's.

Ryanair and commit to operating 43 routes for at least three years if Ryanair's Aer Lingus bid succeeds, he said.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, is making its third attempt to take over rival Aer Lingus and has been told by the European Commission it has one last chance to submit measures to prove the merger will not curb competition. Ryanair will also provide Flybe Ireland with forward sales cash and liabilities worth around E50 million. In return Flybe will pay Ryanair E1 million for the newly created airline. In addition to the Flybe deal, Ryanair will pass Aer Lingus's routes from London's Gatwick Airport to British Airways. Mr French said Flybe
would like to bring more choice and flexibility to the Irish markets. Speaking on RTE's Morning Ireland, he said the airline wanted to develop a slightly different business model and "develop frequency particularly in some of the shorter routes into the UK". Mr French also said it was "disingenuous and unfair" to say that Flybe was bankrupt. He said when the company was floated two-and-a-half years ago no money was taken out by the shareholders - "that money was planned to be reinvested...to expand our business in Continental Europe". He added that the company has up to 35 jets on order. "We said we'd use the money to pay down the deposit on those new jets.
"So it's not burning money, it's using the money you've took from the market for that reason," he said.

EU/UK merger control - Court of Appeal decision in  Ryanair v Competition Commission and  Aer Lingus
John Milligan

On 13 December the English Court of Appeal handed down a judgment which concluded that it would not contravene the obligation of 'sincere cooperation' between the EU and member states for the UK Competition Commission (CC) to proceed with its investigation into Ryanair's 29.82% stake in Aer Lingus. The European Commission is currently conducting a second phase investigation of Ryanair's current notified bid for the entirety of Aer Lingus' capital and this is due to be completed in January 2013. As a result of the ruling, the CC is under no obligation to stay its investigation. The CC has a statutory timescale of 24 weeks (extendable by up to eight weeks), and its investigation would be expected to be concluded after the EU Commission's decision.
EU proceedings

The facts of the case are unusual and have generated long running litigation on the interaction of the EU Commission's exclusive 'one stop shop' jurisdiction under the EU merger regulation 139/2004 with national
merger control regimes, in this case the Enterprise Act 2002. Ryanair had first notified its bid for the acquisition of the whole of Aer Lingus (having already acquired a minority stake) to the European Commission in 2007. This
was prohibited as incompatible with the competition rules, the Commission emphasising differences from previous airline mergers in that this was a merger of the two main airlines in a single country, operating from the same home airport (Dublin), both low-cost airlines, operating on a point-to-point basis and with a greater number of overlapping routes than in previous airline cases.

Aer Lingus had requested the EU Commission to order that Ryanair divest the shares it had already acquired, but the EU Commission refused to do so on the basis it had no such power. The EU merger regulation confers jurisdiction on the EU Commission over mergers in which, as a minimum, the acquirer has the possibility of exercising a decisive influence over the activity of the undertaking being acquired. Ryanair's stake fell short of this level. The Court of Appeal decision reports that, while the EU Commission concluded that it had no such power itself, the EU Commission suggested that the UK competition authorities might.

The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) initially indicated that that the EU merger regulation, which prohibits member states applying their own legislation to a concentration caught by the regulation, precluded it from investigating. Action by Aer Lingus before the EU Commission and the General Court seeking divestment and interim measures to prevent the exercise by Ryanair of voting rights were not successful; nor was Ryanair's appeal against the EU Commission's prohibition (Joined cases T-342/07 and T-411/07, 6 July 2010). Proceedings in the EU came to an end at this point.
OFT investigation

In September 2010 the OFT requested information from Ryanair under the Enterprise Act 2002 merger control provisions to enable it to decide whether its minority shareholding gave it a material influence over the behaviour and policy of Aer Lingus, as a result of which it would have jurisdiction to investigate. 'Material influence' is a lower level of control than the 'decisive influence' test used by the European Commission under the EU merger regulation.

The OFT has four months in which to refer a merger to the CC, time running from the date of completion, or the date the merger was made public if later, though there is an exception whereby the time is suspended where there are EU proceedings under way. Ryanair objected that this limit had expired in 2007.

Page 125 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The OFT in January 2011 decided that the time limit for reaching a decision on the minority acquisition did not begin to run until the expiry of the time for appealing the EU General Court's judgment. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) upheld the OFT, stating that, had the domestic merger rules been applied before Aer Lingus's appeal had been finally resolved, there would have been a risk of the OFT infringing Article 21(3) of the EU merger regulation (which provides that no Member State shall apply its national legislation on competition to any concentration falling within the scope of the EU merger regulation). That risk was such as to trigger the duty of sincere co-operation under Article 4 of the EU Treaty, meaning that the OFT was obliged to avoid that risk.
OFT referral to CC

The OFT subsequently referred Ryanair's minority shareholding to the CC on 15 June 2012. On 19 June Ryanair announced its public bid, invited the CC to stay its investigation and subsequently notified the EU Commission. The CC informed the parties that it had decided to continue its investigation and required the production of documents by Ryanair and responses to a merger enquiry questionnaire. This refusal to stay was the subject of the appeal to the CAT that the investigation should be stayed pending the EU Commission's investigation into the public bid on the basis of the exclusive jurisdiction of the EU Commission. The CAT held that Ryanair's minority holding did not constitute a 'concentration' under the EU merger regulation and that the CC's jurisdiction over the minority stake was distinct from the EU Commission's jurisdiction over the public bid and was, therefore, unaffected by the prohibition on applying national law to any concentration having a Community dimension.

The Court of Appeal upheld the CAT, adding that a cautious approach must be followed by the national authorities but generally stating that even if there was a theoretical possibility that the CC's decision on the minority shareholding could be relevant to that of the EU Commission on the public bid, or vice versa, the EU Commission's decision would be delivered first. In any event, even if the CC finished its investigation first, it could defer the implementation of any remedial action until the conclusion of the EU Commission's investigation.
EU "stops the clock" on the ETS Mark Bisset
On 12 November 2012, the EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedergaard announced that the Commission planned to "stop the clock" and suspend application of the EU Emissions Trading Aviation Directive 2008/1001 as regards flights to and from third countries on both EU and non-EU airlines. This means that the Directive will not
be enforced and payment will not be required by EU regulatory authorities in respect of extra-EU flights by airlines which exceed their emissions limit and are unable to buy additional allowances.

Application of the Directive has been suspended until an ICAO Council meeting next autumn to allow a global market based initiative, which appears to have been gathering momentum, and which creates a chance to develop a global solution. The Directive has been widely criticised by non-EU airlines and governments and was subject to a challenge by the Air Transport Association of America (now Airlines for America) before the English High Court which was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In December 2011 the CJEU Grand Chamber held that the Directive was not contrary to the Chicago Convention and general principles of international law.

The Commission states that it is taking this step to allow ICAO a chance to put a global ETS solution in place but if this comes to nothing by next autumn the Directive will be reactivated.

Further details are expected from the Commission on how this "stop the clock" procedure will be implemented, but we set out in this brief note the answers to some of the main questions that have been raised since the announcement was made, so far as information is currently available.
Which flights are impacted?

The suspension applies to all "international" flights whether operated by EU carriers or non-EU carriers. An "international" flight is any flight to and from the EU, which includes for this purpose Croatia (being an accession state), the EEA states (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and (from 2014) Switzerland. The Directive continues to apply to all intra-EU flights whether operated by EU carriers or non-EU carriers.
How will this be implemented?

In the press announcement on 12 November 2012, Ms Hedergaard explained that whilst she has had regular consultations with the Member States prior to making the announcement, there would need to be a formal proposal which the European Council, the European Parliament and Member States would all have to endorse.

Page 126 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
However, she also stated that she would not have made the press announcement if she was not confident of their support.

The principle is that the Aviation Directive will remain fully in force but will be supplemented by a derogation that covers international flights. This will be done by way of adding a paragraph to Article 16 of the Directive so that action will not be taken against aircraft operators which do not meet the Directive's reporting and compliance obligations arising before the ICAO Assembly in respect of international flights. The only condition for this is that they have not received, or have returned, free allowances received in 2012 for such flights. Compliance sanctions will not be taken in case of the non-reporting of such emissions.

This derogation will need to follow the EU's co-decision procedure, and the Directorate-General for Climate Action (DG CLIMA) is hopeful that it will be ready by April 2013. There remains, however, the possibility that the European Council or, more likely, the European Parliament, may raise objections. Further, as the scheme is implemented through national legislation in each Member State, the derogation will have to be implemented nationally as well, so potentially there could be delay at the local level.

There is also, of course, the possibility of legal challenge to the validity of the derogation, in many respects relying on the mirror image of some of the arguments deployed by non-EU airlines first time round.
How does this impact the auctioning of allowances?

The percentage of auctioning remains at 15%. Consequently, a proportionately lower quantity of aviation allowances will be auctioned for 2012.
What about allowances that have been issued for compliance in April 2013?

According to their first calculations, the Commission expects to withdraw about two-thirds of the allowances that they had initially allocated to the 2012 period. The details will be published in the coming weeks by the Member States, and operators will be notified individually by their supervising authority.
What about small emitters?

A small emitter is a non-commercial air transport operator whose flights in aggregate emit less than 10,000 tonnes of CO2 per annum, or which operates fewer than 243 flights per period for three consecutive four-month periods. A small emitter can take advantage of a simplified procedure to monitor its emissions of CO2 from its flight activity. We understand that small emitters will still be bound to comply with the EU ETS despite the derogation, but will only need to pay for emissions in Europe. More detail is awaited.
What does the Commission expect from the 2013 ICAO Assembly?

No alternative scheme has yet been agreed by ICAO and no alternative scheme is going to be in place for a few years yet, so what does the Commission expect from the 2013 ICAO Assembly? The Commission expects that the Assembly should agree on a global market-based measure (MBM) with a realistic timetable and road map for
it to apply, alongside endorsing an ICAO framework for facilitating states' application of MBMs pending application of the global measure. There should also be "progress" on the development, submission and review of State
action plans.
What if the 2013 ICAO Assembly fails to reach a satisfactory agreement?

In the initial press briefings the impression was given that the compliance obligations are being deferred and not waived (the deferral was described as "temporary"). It appeared that should the meeting not produce the desired outcome, the deferred obligations would be applied "automatically".

However, according to the latest Commission briefing (10 December 2012), it is stated that "the derogation for flights operated to and from 3rd counties in 2012 will be permanent".
Automatic re-activation of obligations would have raised a number of questions. How is an operator to meet its
2012 obligations? How is an operator to retrospectively monitor its emissions unless it has already captured the
relevant data in compliance with the scheme? (We would note here that airlines would be well advised to continue
their monitoring and reporting). Does the deferral mean that the 2012 obligations must be met by surrendering the
necessary quantity of allowances by the next compliance deadline, i.e. by 30th April 2014 (for 2013)? If so, what
types of allowances may be used? May Phase 2 (2012) allowances be used to meet a Phase 3 (2013 - 2020)
obligation, notwithstanding that the EU Directive states that units issued for Phase 2 may only be used in that
period? Phase 2 EUAs are expected to be cancelled and replaced by Phase 3 allowances by July 2013, will this
Page 127 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
proceed? As always, the devil is in the detail and further legislation (following the co-decision procedure) may well be required if ETS obligations are re-activated; in the meantime, operators are left to face a lengthy period of uncertainty until it is absolutely certain that the 2012 derogation is to be permanent (we await the actual
proposal).
What about the US ETS Prohibition Act? (the "Thune" legislation)

On 3 December 2012 President Obama signed into law the bill banning US airlines from compliance with the ETS. This Act empowers the US Department of Transport to enact the necessary secondary legislation, but DG CLIMA believes that the DoT will not do it, at least not until October 2013, which is the date of the ICAO General Assembly. It should be noted that the Act does not preclude US carriers from respecting their ETS obligations for intra-European flights.

In a rehearsal of the arguments made in the ATA case, DG CLIMA believes that the Act is in breach of the EU - US Open Skies Agreement of March 2010.
Is the "stop the clock" decision discriminatory?

The "stop the clock" measure seems to defeat one of the key principles underpinning the validity of the original inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS, that of non-discrimination in the treatment of operators. We may recall with a touch of irony the words of Advocate General Kokott in rejecting the ATA's legal challenge to the extra-territorial features of the ETS: "If the EU legislature had excluded airlines holding the nationality of a third country from the EU emissions trading scheme those airlines would have obtained an unjustified competitive advantage over their European competitors...Such favourable treatment would have been unjustified in view of the objective of Directive 2008/101 and such a course of action would not have been compatible with the principle of fair and equal opportunity laid down in Article 2 of the Open Skies Agreement".

Arguably hub and spoke international airlines based in the EU will be the biggest losers as a result of this interim measure. For example, a passenger flying from Brussels to New York via Heathrow will face an EU ETS charge on his or her flight to London. However, a passenger flying to New York direct from Brussels will face no emissions charges at all.
Conclusion

This is a dramatic U-turn by the Commission and may well have arisen due to political pressure which has been brought to bear by many third country carriers and their governments, for example from the US, China, Russia and India. The decision will in many ways be welcome to airlines but its economically discriminatory effect will be troubling to EU airlines and it raises some very difficult questions of detail to which the answers are not presently clear. It is to be hoped that the further details to be given in forthcoming EU technical briefings will provide sufficient clarification.
French judgment on application of Regulation 261/2004 to return flights by non-Community carriers
Benjamin Potier

The Cour de Cassation, French Supreme court, rendered a decision on 21 November 2012 clarifying the notion of place of departure under EU Regulation 261/2004 when the passenger travels with a round-trip ticket.
Regulation 261/2004 provides for automatic compensation of passengers in the event of cancellation of flights
and denied boarding. This regulation applies (a) to passengers departing from an airport located in the territory of
a Member State to which the Treaty applies; and (b) to passengers departing from an airport located in a third
country to an airport situated in the territory of a Member State to which the Treaty applies (...) if the operating air
carrier of the flight concerned is a Community carrier.

In this case, the passenger had bought from Air Algérie a round-trip ticket from Paris (Roissy-Charles de Gaulle) airport to Annaba (Algeria). The delay occurred in the return from Annaba to Paris. Although the judgment of the first instance tribunal is not available, it is assumed that the claimant deemed compensation for flight delay to be payable on the basis of the Sturgeon judgment. As Air Algérie is not a Community carrier, the Regulation could apply only based on (a) above, and therefore the question was whether the place of departure as defined by the regulation was Paris or Annaba.




Page 128 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The first instance tribunal (Juge de proximité, who has jurisdiction for claims below 4,000€) ruled that the place of departure was Paris because it was the place where the passenger started his journey to Annaba. The Cour de Cassation overruled this decision, deciding that the place of departure was Annaba.

Interestingly, the Cour de Cassation cited the judgment of the European Court of Justice dated 10 July 2008 (Emirates Airlines - C173-07), which rendered a similar ruling. It is not common that the Cour de Cassation cites a decision of the European Court of Justice, thus showing an unexpected deference to this Court.

Even more interesting is the fact that the Cour de Cassation declared that the Warsaw Convention applies to this matter. This can be seen as the mere result of the non-application of Regulation 261/2004. However, one could argue that the Montreal Convention should apply because the place of destination was Paris (Roissy-Charles de Gaulle). The Warsaw Convention would apply only if the place of destination was Annaba in Algeria because Algeria is not a party to the Montreal Convention but only to the Warsaw Convention. Although there is no clear precedent of French courts on this point, it is commonly understood that the place of destination within the meaning of both conventions (Montreal and Warsaw) in a round-trip journey is the place of original departure as it is also the final destination of the passenger.
Therefore this decision can be interpreted in two ways:

Either the Cour de Cassation did not see that the Montreal Convention, not the Warsaw Convention, should apply. Indeed, in principle the Cour de Cassation only rules on the arguments (moyens) raised by the parties; the only dispute was whether Regulation 261/2004 applied to this matter; Air Algérie claimed that the Warsaw Convention should apply in spite of Regulation 261/2004, but this does not seem to have been disputed by the claimant; therefore the Cour de Cassation had no reason to apply the Montreal Convention rather than the Warsaw Convention

Or the Cour de Cassation intended to apply the Warsaw Convention and not the Montreal Convention to this matter, which means that the Cour de Cassation took the view that the place of destination with the meaning of the Conventions is not the place of departure of a round-trip ticket

The facts that (1) the question raised by the parties was not that of the applicability of either the Warsaw Convention or the Montreal Convention and (2) this decision is not meant to be published ("non publiée au bulletin") makes it inadvisable to place too much significance on this aspect of the judgment, and suggests that the Cour de Cassation did not intend to make a decision on such an important issue as the place of destination under the Conventions. The principle importance of the judgment therefore lies in the Cour de Cassation's confirmation of the approach of the European Court of Justice - ie, that, for the purposes of Regulation 261/2004, the place of departure of the return flight in a round-trip journey is to be considered to be the intermediate point in the journey, and hence that the EU-bound leg of a round-trip journey by a non- Community carrier is not subject
to the Regulation.
European Commission updates the banned list
Alan Meneghetti
Rebecca Chant

The European Commission has recently adopted the twentieth update of the list of airlines and air operators who are subject to restrictions on operating within the EU due to safety deficiencies (the Banned List).
Background
Regulation 2111/2005 was a response by the EU to a number of highly publicised aircraft crashes involving
non-EU operators and EU citizens, including the Birgenair Flight 301 crash in 1996, which resulted in the death of
167 German nationals and, in 2004, the accident off Sharm-el-Sheikh involving Flash Airways which caused the
death of a large number of French nationals. One of the objectives of the Regulation is to provide more
transparency to air passengers in respect of air carriers that do not meet relevant EU safety standards. This
objective is accomplished through the publication of the Banned List, which lists all carriers which are banned
from operating in European airspace or which are otherwise subject to traffic restrictions for safety reasons.
Carriers that transport passengers and cargo for commercial purposes are included on the Banned List
(irrespective of their nationality) on the basis of the following criteria:
Evidence of serious safety deficiencies on the part of a carrier

Page 129 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A lack of ability (or willingness) on the part of the carrier to address safety deficiencies (including a lack of transparency or insufficient action)

A lack of ability (or willingness) on the part of the authorities responsible for overseeing a carrier to address safety deficiencies (including a lack of co-operation, insufficient ability etc)

Every three months the Commission must assess whether the Banned List needs to be updated to add or remove certain carriers. This assessment is made by the Air Safety Committee, which is composed of representatives
from EASA, the 27 Member States of the EU, Croatia, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.
The Banned List

The Banned List is presented in two parts: Annex A lists those carriers which are subject to a complete operating ban within European airspace, whereas Annex B lists those carriers which are subject to operational restrictions (and what those restrictions are). It is worth noting that carriers listed in Annex A will still be permitted to use aircraft in the EU that are wet-leased from carriers not contained on the Banned List and, indeed, this way is often used by carriers which are on the Banned List in order to get around the restrictions.

The Banned List includes blanket bans on all carriers subject to oversight from an aviation authority that is unable or unwilling to rectify safety-related shortcomings. This may be evidenced by:

A lack of cooperation with the aviation authority of a Member State with regard to safety concerns about a carrier licensed or certified by that authority

An inability to enforce relevant safety standards, such as corrective plans drawn up by the ICAO following inspections under the Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme

In the current version of the Banned List, all but three of the entries relate to blanket bans for aircraft licensed or certified by specific national aviation authorities.
November 2012 update

There were no surprise additions or deletions from the Banned List in its most recent update, which resulted in two hundred and eighty-seven airlines from 20 non- European countries being on the Banned List. The most notable addition are all carriers from Eritrea and the most notable removals are of Jordan Aviation and of all carriers from Mauritania.
Right of appeal

If an airline considers that it should be taken off the Banned List because it complies with the relevant safety standards, it can address a request to the Commission or a Member State, either directly or through its civil aviation authority. Only the Commission or a Member Sate may make a request for the Banned List to be updated. The Air Safety Committee will then assess the evidence presented to substantiate the request for removal from the Banned List and formulate an opinion to the Commission.
Conclusions

Although there were no unexpected additions or deletions from the Banned List in the most recent November update it is of some concern that there are still numerous civil aviation authorities and, to a lesser extent, airlines, which appear to fail to meet the safety standard requirements of the EU.

The Banned List does, however, continue to divide opinion and raise questions as to whether it is the most effective way of addressing perceived safety deficiencies and shortcomings. Although some of the most recent amendments to the Banned List were due to a meaningful improvement of safety standards by the relevant civil aviation authority and/or airline, there is still debate as to whether or not a more collaborative approach (along the lines of that taken by the US) to remedy the deficiencies and shortcomings might produce results which are of greater long-term benefit to the global aviation industry.
Aviation noise: the EU regulatory regime
Alan Meneghetti
Rebecca Chant


Page 130 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
According to the European Commission, the European aviation sector is one of the best performing and most dynamic parts of the European economy. Almost 800 million passengers (one third of the world market) travel each year by air from, to and within the EU. Whilst the importance of the aviation industry to the European economy is recognised, there is concern to regulate aviation noise. This article explores the current European regulatory regime on aviation noise and proposed new European measures.
Why regulate aviation noise?

The potential health consequences of elevated sound levels are well documented. These include hearing impairment, hypertension, sleep disturbance, stress and anti-social behaviour.

A statistical analysis of the health effects of aviation noise on over one million residents around Cologne airport concluded that aviation noise significantly impairs health, increasing the risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks.
The current law
The current European regime on aviation noise largely derives from Directive 2002/30, which applies to EEA
airports with more than 50,000 civil aircraft flights per year.
'Balanced approach'

The Directive obliges Member States to take a 'balanced approach' to aviation noise management. This is an approach which attempts to limit noise through:
Reduction of aircraft noise at source
Land-use planning and management measures
Noise abatement operational procedures
Local operating restrictions
This is based on the balanced approach suggested in Resolution A35-5 of the International Civil Aviation
Organization.

The Directive provides that Member States should consider the costs and benefits of proposed measures and airport-specific characteristics, and, importantly, should ensure that measures are not more than necessary.

The Directive prescribes factors that must be taken into account when operating restrictions are considered. These include an inventory of current measures, a forecast of the levels of noise if the measures were not to be implemented and an assessment of the impact of the new measures.

Member States must ensure that no restrictions are introduced without prior consultation of interested parties, which can include airport and airline operators, pressure groups and residents' associations.
'Marginally compliant' aircraft

The main method by which the Directive seeks to manage aviation noise is by the withdrawal of 'marginally compliant' aircraft. These are aircraft for which the difference between the certified noise level and the maximum permitted noise level, as described in the Convention on International Civil Aviation, is not more than 5EPNdB (Effective Perceived Noise in Decibels). The Directive allows for the introduction of operating restrictions which
aim to facilitate the withdrawal of marginally compliant aircraft, first by prohibiting increases in their movements as compared to the previous year, and then by requiring operators to reduce their movements by 20% per year.
Reaction to the Directive
Positive points

A European Commission report found that stakeholders appreciated the introduction of a framework in which all relevant interests were taken into account when assessing new noise control measures. Some airports have indicated that the Directive provides a useful checklist of potential measures and has raised awareness of possible actions and good practice among small and medium-sized airports.
Focus on marginally compliant aircraft
Page 131 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
However, the Directive's focus on marginally compliant aircraft has attracted criticism. This aspect of the Directive is considered to be largely irrelevant to many operators' businesses, as economic pressures and natural replacement cycles have led to an almost entirely compliant fleet. Less than 12% of aircraft in the EEA and Switzerland and less than 20% of aircraft worldwide are marginally compliant.
Inconsistent implementation

EU directives contain general principles which Member States must then implement by way of their local law, providing Member States with an element of discretion. The separate implementation of the Directive by each Member State has led to a wide variation in the regulatory regime across Europe.
Scope

Many have questioned the need for, and purpose of, the Directive, as it has only been used in respect of a limited number of airports. Stakeholders are frequently of the opinion that the Directive is not sufficiently clear and, in many cases, adds little or nothing to existing national legislation. In the UK, for example, the Civil Aviation Act
1982 already empowers the Secretary of State to prescribe measures relating to aviation noise.
The proposed new law
The new law

In December 2011 the European Commission launched its 'Better Airports Package' of suggested measures to address capacity shortages at European airports and improve the quality of services offered to passengers. The package contained legislative proposals on slot allocation, ground handling and aviation noise.

It was proposed to replace the Directive with a new EU regulation. As a regulation rather than a directive, the Regulation would be directly applicable in each Member State: it would not require implementation under local law. Aviation noise regulation would therefore be harmonised across Europe.

In June 2012 the European Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council agreed on a draft of the Regulation, amending several of the European Commission's proposals. There are further legislative stages to be completed before the Regulation becomes law.
Balanced approach

The European Commission has stressed that the Regulation is not about setting noise targets or noise budgets (although many states, including the UK, retain the ability to do so under national legislation), but instead focuses on the decision-making process.

The Regulation will apply the balanced approach to aviation noise management consistently across the EEA. Disparities between Member States will be removed and this will ensure that certain processes are adhered to where measures are taken to mitigate aviation noise.

The Regulation goes further than the Directive in stipulating a process that Member States must follow. They must:
Asses the noise situation at individual airports
Define the environmental objective
Identify available measures
Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the measures
Select the measures
Consult with stakeholders in a transparent way
Decide on measures and provide sufficient notification
Implement the measures
Provide for dispute resolution

Page 132 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Regular assessments

The Regulation proposes regular assessments of the noise situation at airports and that, where the assessment reveals that new measures are necessary, a forum for cooperation is established between airport operators, aircraft operators and air navigation service providers. This forum will consult regularly with local residents or their representatives, giving them at least three months to provide responses on proposed measures.

Although the Regulation requires consultation with local residents, it does not appear that any specific weight should be given to their grievances or that they should be able to block proposed measures.
Marginally compliant aircraft

The Regulation will allow national authorities to phase out the noisiest aircraft more effectively. A stricter threshold will be applied for the definition of marginally compliant aircraft to reflect the modernisation of fleets and to
expedite the phasing out of older aircraft.
Next steps
The draft Regulation was examined and debated by the Transport and Tourism Committee on 21 November
2012, and the debate was reported in the Official Journal at OJ 11/12/2012-34. Concerns had been voiced by the
German Bundesrat, Austrian Bundesrat, French Senate and Dutch First Chamber, over the parts of the
Regulation which would allow the EU Commission to veto noise-abatement measures, particularly as these are
often decided on as a result of long negotiations between stakeholders. In the revised draft, the Committee has
stressed that the EU Commission's oversight of national measures should obey the subsidiarity principle, and has
removed the EU Commission's power to override measures approved and decided on by Member States.

Further amendments have been made to introduce considerations relating to the health and quality of life of residents into the matrix of 'cost effectiveness'. These measures go some way to diluting the position taken in the original draft, which would have focused heavily on purely economic considerations.

A debate was held in the European Parliament on 11 December 2012, and the following day the European Parliament voted to approve the draft Regulation 501 votes to 155 with eight abstentions. We now have to wait for the Council's first reading position in respect of the draft Regulation.
New Russian rules on compensation in disability and personal injury cases
David Willcox
Maria Wood

Another attempt to provide guidance and clarity in connection with the level of compensation payable in personal injury cases has been undertaken by the Russian Government.
The 2010 Rules

"The Rules on Obligatory Insurance of Carrier's Liability to Passengers" were approved by the Russian Government in 2008 and came into force on 1 January 2010 as an integral part of Section 133 of the Russian Air Code 1997.

The 2010 Rules provided obligatory minimum payments in personal injury cases, depending on the nature of the injury. Referring to "obligatory insurance" and laying down a compulsory minimum, the 2010 Rules appeared rather to provide for a personal accident type of payment, as opposed to an assessment of compensation on a legal liability basis.

The 2010 Rules applied to injuries sustained by passengers during Russian domestic carriage by air, and introduced three bands of compensation depending on the seriousness of the injury. A schedule of injury types was set out under each of the three bands. Thus, assessment of compensation seemed likely to be a very straightforward exercise, but this has not proved to be the case.

A problem faced by defence lawyers was that the purportedly exhaustive list of injuries for which compensation could be awarded under the 2010 Rules was rather lacking in precision. There was also a significant difference between the three levels of compensation for each band: RUR 300,000 (USD 9,700) for minor injuries; RUR
600,000 (USD 19,420) for more serious injuries; and RUR 1,000,000 (USD 32,500) for the most serious injuries. Lawyers were supposed to be able to match the specific injury to one of the three categories but, of course,

Page 133 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
injuries are never the same and often multiple injuries may be sustained, some major, some minor, so this proved a difficult exercise. There was a potential risk of under, or over, compensating victims.

If a passenger sustained injuries crossing two different compensation bands, a practice developed whereby compensation was awarded on the basis of the more severe injury. Insurers began to demand that medical reports specify precisely the injury sustained so as to establish precisely which band an injury fell into and, thus, the proper level of compensation. That caused additional aggravation for claimants and associated difficulties for settlement.

Problems also arose if the injury was so small that it fell in no category at all. Further, there were concerns that, as to claims under the international Warsaw/Hague regime, the Russian courts would use these Rules (where compensation is seen as "fixed" and "automatic") as a benchmark for awards of compensation, even though strictly speaking the Rules apply only to domestic contracts of carriage.
The 2013 Rules
On 15 November 2012, the Russian Government adopted new Rules on "Determining Insurance Compensation
Level in Personal Injury". The Rules come into force on 1 January 2013.

The 2013 Rules provide a much more extensive list of injury types and a new methodology for calculation, theoretically to allow an individual assessment of each specific injury. It is no doubt hoped that this will avoid defendants - and claimants - having to try to pigeonhole each injury into the one of three bands provided in the
2010 Rules. Clearly, this should be an improvement.

The 2013 Rules also provide for a fixed amount of compensation for injuries which qualify for first, second and third degrees of (permanent or partially permanent) disability, in the amounts of RUR 2,000,000 (USD 65,000); RUR 1,400,000 (USD 45,000) and RUR 1,000,000 (USD 32,000) respectively. Children sustaining disability will be awarded USD 2,000,000 (USD 65,000).

As to personal injuries not equating to disability, the 2013 Rules provide for assessment of damages by reference to a specific percentage "multiplier" (or scale) to be applied depending on the nature and extent of the injury. The percentage will then be applied to the baseline figures set out in the three compensation bands, provided by the
2010 Rules. Since 2010, many policies provide specifically for coverage for the payment obligations set out in the
2010 Rules.

While the more extensive listing of the injuries will be helpful, application of the 2013 Rules may still be problematic. For example, if a claimant sustains a fractured jaw, the 2013 Rules require a multiplier of "10%", but
10% of what? The Rules suggest the percentage could be applied to any of the three set bands for compensation. Insurers will in many cases have to decide how they wish to apply the Rules, and the courts are likely to be called in to decide where there is a difference of views.

It therefore remains to be seen whether new rules prove to be more efficient and productive and how they will work in practice.
Increasing holiday pay for airline pilots? Peter Roser
In a decision delivered in October 2012, in British Airways v Williams and others, the Supreme Court considered whether a pilot's holiday pay should take into account certain contractual supplementary payments. It confirmed that holiday pay should be calculated on the basis of normal remuneration, which will include remuneration intrinsically linked to the performance of contractual tasks. Holiday pay should not, however, extend to remuneration that is intended to cover ancillary expenses and costs.
Background to Supreme Court's decision

Under collective agreements incorporated into their contracts, BA pilots were entitled to basic pay plus two supplementary payments (a "flying pay supplement" and a "time away from base allowance"). However, in
periods of statutory annual leave the pilots were only paid basic pay. The pilots claimed that the two supplements should have been included in their holiday pay calculation and brought claims in the Employment Tribunal. Ms Williams acted as lead claimant for some 2,750 claimants employed by BA.

An Employment Tribunal and Employment Appeal Tribunal found in the pilots' favour; however, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision and found that there was no breach where BA paid the pilots basic pay only during periods of leave.

The pilots appealed to the Supreme Court, which concluded that the requirements of the Working Time Directive and the Aviation Directive (which governed the calculations of payments for leave and have been incorporated into UK domestic law via the Working Time Regulations 1998 and the Civil Aviation (Working Time) Regulations
2004 respectively) were unclear. Accordingly, the Supreme Court referred a number of questions to the Court of
Justice of the EU (CJEU) seeking clarification on the meaning of the two Directives.

Last year the CJEU responded by stating that, in line with the annual leave provisions of the Working Time Directive, the Aviation Directive requires that airline pilots are entitled not only to basic salary but to "normal remuneration" during statutory annual leave. Its reasoning was as follows:

"Paid annual leave" under the Working Time Directive meant that workers on holiday should receive their normal remuneration. The purpose of holiday payment is to put workers in a position which is comparable to the position they are in during periods of work.

Remuneration linked intrinsically to the performance of tasks which a worker is contractually required to perform (in the case of airline pilots, payments in respect of time spent flying) must be taken into account when calculating holiday pay.

In contrast, however, components of remuneration which are intended exclusively to cover ancillary costs (e.g. travel and subsistence) arising at the time of the performance of contractual duties need not be taken into account when calculating holiday pay.

The case was then returned to the UK Supreme Court to determine whether various components comprising the pilots' total remuneration met the criteria to be included in the holiday pay calculation.
Supreme Court

The Supreme Court concluded that the claims should be remitted to the Employment Tribunal for further consideration of the appropriate payments to be made to the pilots in respect of the periods of leave. Their reasoning was as follows:

Holiday pay should include remuneration intrinsically linked to the performance of contractual tasks. It is therefore expected that the Employment Tribunal will find that the "flying pay supplement" (which is a guaranteed payment
a pilot receives when flying) should be included for the purposes of calculating holiday pay.

As to the "time away from base allowance", the Employment Tribunal must decide whether the parties genuinely intended that such payments would exclusively cover costs for time spent away from home, in which case they should not be included.
What this decision means for employers

This case must now go back to the Employment Tribunal to decide whether or not the disputed payments should be included in the calculation of holiday pay. Employers in the aviation industry should therefore watch out for the Tribunal's decision which, if decided in favour of the claimant pilots, will be highly significant, potentially resulting in increasing employers' costs.
Compensation for flight delays: the European court abandons the rule of law
John Balfour
In its much-awaited ruling in Joined Cases C581/10 Nelson v Lufthansa and C629/10 TUI, British Airways,
easyJet and IATA v UK CAA, delivered on 23 October 2012, the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the EU
declined the opportunity presented by these two references to revise the controversial ruling issued by the Court
in November 2009 in the Sturgeon case.

The Court confirmed that EU Regulation 261/2004 is to be interpreted as entitling passengers to compensation where, on account of a delayed flight, they arrive at their final destination three hours or more after the originally scheduled time, unless the carrier can prove that the delay was caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken. In doing so it has arrogated to itself legislative powers contrary to the principle of separation of powers and paid scant regard to the principle of
Page 135 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
legal certainty, which are fundamental principles required by the rule of law. The Court expressed the view that such an interpretation was necessitated by the principle of equal treatment, and that it was not incompatible with: the Montreal Convention; its previous ruling in the IATA/ELFAA case; the legislative intent; the principle of legal certainty; or the principle of proportionality. It also confirmed that this interpretation was to be applied from the entry into force of the Regulation (on 17 February 2005).
The Court's reasoning, and analysis
The principle of equal treatment

The Court found that the principle of equal treatment requires such an interpretation because passengers whose flights are delayed for three hours or more suffer a loss of time similar to that suffered by passengers whose flights are cancelled. The reason for the three hour threshold is that a carrier does not have to pay compensation to a passenger whose flight is cancelled if it offers the passenger re-routing bringing departure forward by no more than one hour and deferring arrival by no more than two hours.

The Court did not discuss the possible alternative approach (raised by Sharpston AG in the original Sturgeon case, and by the referring court in the TUI reference) of declaring void the supposedly unequal provisions on compensation for cancellation, even though this would have been more consistent with its approach to the effect of the principle in other cases.
Montreal Convention

The Court followed the reasoning applied in its IATA/ELFAA ruling, and took the view that fixed levels of compensation for delay constitute standardised and immediate redress for the inconvenience suffered by way of loss of time, and that such inconvenience does not constitute "damage occasioned by delay" within the meaning of Article 19 of the Convention and hence falls outside the scope of Article 29. Article 29 provides that "In the carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo, any action for damages, however founded, whether under this Convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise, can only be brought subject to the conditions and such limits of liability as are set out in this Convention...In any such action, punitive, exemplary or any other non-compensatory damages shall not be recoverable".

The Court further reasoned that Article 19 implies that there is a causal link between the delay and the damage and that the damage is individual to the passenger, whereas: "a loss of time is not damage arising as a result of a delay, but is an inconvenience"; a delayed flight causes the same loss of time for all passengers on the flight, for which standardised and immediate assistance may be given; and there is not necessarily a causal link between the delay and the loss of time giving rise to compensation, as the compensation is payable once a delay of three hours has been reached and does not increase if the delay extends beyond this period. Furthermore, the obligation to pay compensation under the Regulation is additional to the carrier's liability under the Montreal Convention, as it operates at an earlier stage, and does not prevent passengers from receiving further damages, under the Convention, in respect of their individual losses.

the damage that is constituted by the inconvenience that delay in the carriage of passengers by air causesThe argument that a loss of time caused by a delay is an "inconvenience" but not damage clearly strains credibility. Moreover, the Court itself deals it a fatal blow when it says (in paragraph 46 of its ruling): "In paragraph 45 of IATA and ELFAA, the Court held that it does not follow from Articles 19, 22 or 29 of the Montreal Convention, or from any other provisions thereof, that the authors of that convention intended to shield air carriers from any form of intervention other than those laid down by those provisions, in particular action which could be envisaged by the public authorities to redress, in a standardised and immediate manner, [emphasis added], without the passengers having to suffer the inconvenience inherent in the bringing of actions for damages before the courts".

The Court also failed to raise and answer the obvious question - what would the position be if a carrier did not pay compensation and the passenger brought an action against the carrier in respect of this failure. Surely that would constitute an action for damages within the scope of Article 29, and hence its prohibition of non-compensatory damages (as clearly the Regulation's standardised amounts of compensation are) would come into play?

The fundamental problem with the Court's approach is that the distinction drawn by the Court between the scope of the Convention and the scope of the Regulation, originally in the IATA/ELFAA case and repeated here, is based on a fatal fallacy, because the measures envisaged by the Regulation are not all "standardised and
immediate measures", because they include the obligation to reimburse to the passenger the cost of the ticket for the part(s) of the journey not made and for any parts already made if the flight is no longer serving any purpose
for the passenger, which is a far from standardised and immediate matter.

Page 136 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The IATA/ELFAA ruling

The Court found no tension between its ruling in the IATA/ ELFAA case and its ruling in the Sturgeon case, for the reasons set out in paragraphs 46 - 48 of its present ruling - ie, because in the former the Court held that standardised and immediate redress for the inconvenience caused by delay fell outside the scope of the Montreal Convention and, though it did not in that case consider the question of compensation, it did not exclude it, and in the latter ruling the Court held that inconvenience caused by delay must also be redressed by compensation.

However, this does not satisfactorily dispose of the question of the tension between the two rulings, given the arguments of the parties on the issue, which pointed to the fact that the Court in the IATA/ELFAA case found that the provisions of the Regulation dealing with cancellation and delay were "entirely unambiguous".
Legislative intent

The Court found that it followed from paragraphs 30 - 39 of its ruling that its interpretation was not inconsistent with the EU legislature's intentions. However, these paragraphs deal principally with the question of equal treatment, and all they say about legislative intent is to argue that recital 3 ("...the number of passengers denied boarding against their will remains too high, as does that affected by cancellations without prior warning and that affected by long delays") suggests that the legislature considered that the inconvenience suffered by the latter two groups of passengers was equivalent, and to refer in general terms to the Regulation's aim of increasing
protection for all passengers.
Not only does recital 3 not justify a desperate leap of reasoning, but the Court gave no consideration whatsoever
to the travaux preparatoires, which give a better indication of legislative intent (as recognised by the Court in other
cases), and which were put before the Court in the arguments of the parties.
Legal certainty

The Court confirmed that the well-established principle of legal certainty requires that individuals should be able to ascertain unequivocally what their rights and obligations are and to take steps accordingly, but all it says in response to the arguments of the parties on this crucial point is "Having regard to the requirements arising from the principle of equal treatment, air carriers cannot rely on the principle of legal certainty and claim that the obligation imposed on them by Regulation No 261/2004 to compensate passengers, in the event of delay to a flight, up to the amounts laid down therein infringes the latter principle", and to state that passengers and carriers were able to be perfectly clear about their rights and obligations with regard to compensation for delay once the Sturgeon ruling was delivered.

In other words, according to the Court the principle of equal treatment is superior to that of legal certainty - an astonishing contention, and one inconsistent with the rule of law and common sense, particularly given that the "principle" of equal treatment is much less well-defined and more fluid, and open to interpretative differences. And it is patently self-serving and offensive to claim that once that Court had effectively re-written the Regulation in its Sturgeon ruling the law was perfectly clear.
Proportionality

The Court rejected arguments based on proportionality on the grounds that: the aim of the Regulation is to ensure a high level of protection for passengers regardless of whether they suffer denied boarding, cancellation or delay; the entitlement to fixed compensation ensures a high level of protection, in accordance with this aim; this is "particularly appropriate...given that the loss of time suffered is irreversible, objective and easily quantifiable"; the financial consequences for air carriers are not disproportionate to the aim, because the obligation only arises in
the case of long delays, a defence of extraordinary circumstances is available and air carriers may seek recovery from third parties who caused the delay; the case law shows that the importance of consumer protection may justify negative economic consequences for certain economic operators; data provided to the Court shows that only less than 0.15% of flights give rise to the obligation to pay compensation; and no evidence was presented showing that it would lead to an increase in fares or reduction in services.

Arguments based on proportionality, rightly, have to surmount considerable hurdles, and are rarely sufficient on their own and it is not surprising that they did not succeed in this case. However, there may be some scope for debate about the number of flights affected and/or the degree of the financial burden on airlines and hence the likelihood that the additional expense will be passed on to passengers by way of higher fares.
Temporal effects


Page 137 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Finally, the Court dealt with the question of the temporal effects of the ruling. It confirmed the general rule that when the Court interprets a rule of EU law, that interpretation applies from the time of its entry into force, unless exceptionally, in the context of the actual judgment in question, the Court considers that derogation from this principle is justified. It pointed out that, as the Court in its original Sturgeon ruling considered whether derogation would be justified and concluded that it was not, that was the end of the matter.

There can be little doubt that this is the correct approach, as an interpretation of a legislative provision by a court simply clarifies the meaning of the provision, which it has had since it came into force, even though that meaning may not have been previously clear. The problem lies not in retroactivity of the interpretation but in the incorrectness of the interpretation.
What to do now?

The CJEU has made its view very clear, after having been given the opportunity to reconsider its earlier ruling, and this interpretation of the law is final: there is no possibility of any further reconsideration or appeal. So on first sight it would seem that airlines have no option but to pay the required compensation levels in the case of properly substantiated claims for delay. However, several comments may be made:
Defence of extraordinary circumstances

As the Court confirmed, a carrier will be excused from the obligation if it can show that the delay was caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken, within the meaning of Article 5(3) of the Regulation. Following the strict approach taken by the Court to the scope of this defence in its Wallentin-Hermann ruling, it will generally be difficult for carriers successfully to invoke this defence where delays are caused by technical problems. However, many delays are caused by reasons clearly outside the carrier's control, such as weather, ATC and airport problems - indeed to a greater extent than is the case with cancellations - so that the defence should be available in a significant number of cases.
Time bar
Given the Court's finding that its interpretation of the Regulation applies as from its entry into force on 17
February 2005, an important practical question for airlines will be when backdated claims for compensation for
delay may be refused on the basis that they are time barred.

Some carriers have taken the view that the prescription period under the Montreal Conention should apply, there extinguishing the right to bring proceedings after two years. However, the CJEU has recently ruled in the Joan Cuadrench Moré v KLM case that it a national law, and not the Convention, which will dictate the relevant limitation period. This is consistent with the CJEU's previous view that Regulation 261 falls entirely outside the scope of the Convention. Otherwise, in the UK at any rate a possibility is that courts would apply the six year limitation period applicable to claims for breach of statutory duty.
Recovery from third parties

This is not the first occasion on which the Court has emphasised that the burden on carriers is reduced by their ability to recover from third parties responsible for causing the delay. However, while this possibility exists in theory, the Court does not seem to appreciate that in reality it is likely to be of little assistance, as the third parties involved in many cases (eg, ATC providers, airports) will be able to invoke the protection of immunity and/or exclusion clauses.
Direct effect?

An important question which arises is whether a passenger may bring a successful action against an air carrier which refuses to pay compensation for delay in circumstances where it is required in accordance with the Court's ruling. In view of clear EU jurisprudence on the direct effect of EU regulations (ie, that they may be invoked by private parties for their benefit in national courts), one would have thought that the answer to this question was clear. However, in 2011 an English County Court (in Hendy v Iberia) held that Regulation 261/2004 had no such direct effect, and although this is clearly a decision of a lower level court without precedential value, it is not impossible that other courts might take a similar view, particularly given that the right to compensation for delay arises not from the clear wording of the Regulation but from judicial interpretation of it.
Montreal Convention

Although the Court held that the obligation under the Regulation to pay compensation for delay falls outside the scope of the Montreal Convention, the fact that it did not address the question of what would happen if a
Page 138 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
passenger brought an action in respect of an airline's non-payment could possibly leave it open for a national court, without actually contradicting the CJEU, to hold that such an action fell within Article 29 and to dismiss the claim on the basis that it was for non-compensatory damages for delay, not permitted by Article 29.

Non-EU States party to the Montreal Convention might also wish to consider the possibility of commencing proceedings before the International Court of Justice against EU Member States for contravening their obligations under the Montreal Convention by adopting legislation inconsistent with Article 29, or at least making complaints through diplomatic channels about this infringement of their Convention obligations and the apparent disregard for the rule of law in the EU.
Prosecution and criminal aspects

Non-compliance by a carrier would raise the further question whether it could be successfully prosecuted - in the UK under the 2005 implementing Regulations, which make it an offence for a carrier not to comply with certain specified provisions of Regulation 261. The fundamental principle in criminal law (at least in the UK, and presumably a similar principle applies in other countries) that a person may only be subjected to criminal penalty on clear law, and the fact that it is by no means clear from the face of the law as written (as opposed to judicial interpretation of it) that non-payment of compensation for delay is an offence, may give some scope for a successful defence to any attempted prosecution.
Revision of the Regulation
This assumption of legislative powers by the Court makes the current review of the Regulation by the
Commission and its shortly expected proposals for revision all the more important.
English Court of Appeal holds no right to damages for breach of EU Regulation 261/2004
Nick Medniuk
Payment of compensation under the EU Regulation 261/2004 is a legally controversial topic. Unlike, the
much-awaited ruling of the CJEU in the joined TUI and Nelson cases (discussed above), the English Court of
Appeal decision in Graham v Thomas Cook Airlines UK Limited has been rather unfairly overlooked. Perhaps this
is because, with so much controversy surrounding Regulation 261/2004, there is not much print room left for a
sensible domestic decision. Much more slowly than the ash cloud, upon which the claim is based, reached UK
airspace, proceedings went through two appeals to the Court of Appeal. Amid a number disappointing decisions
here is a respectable decision that should not be ignored in the debate about the scope of the Regulation. With
GBP 50 million potentially at stake, this cancellation claim was optimistic but yet not one which Thomas Cook
could take lightly.
Background to the Court of Appeal decision

On 14 April 2010, the spread of the ash cloud from the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajőkull had the effect of closing UK airspace from 15-20 April 2010. One consequence was the cancellation of Thomas Cook's flight from Manchester to Jamaica, scheduled for 18 April 2010. At the time, there was no clarity about when the UK airspace would re-open. One of the many affected passengers, Miss Najite Graham, obtained a full reimbursement of her ticket price through her travel agent upon request by her father.
Subsequently, and despite the refund, he asserted that he had been provided with misinformation and required
his daughter's flight to be rescheduled under Regulation 261/2004 "for the earliest possible date in June". Initially,
this request was refused, prompting Miss Graham to commence County Court proceedings. Complimentary
tickets were later issued for both father and daughter, and they flew to Jamaica on 14 June 2010.

Notwithstanding that the tickets were intended as a goodwill gesture, the Claimants continued proceedings, seeking:
General damages for distress caused by the cancellation A sum for wasted expenditure incurred by a third party Punitive or exemplary damages of up to GBP 50 million
Both parties applied for summary judgment. While Thomas Cook was held to be in breach of Article 8 of the Regulation, the claim was ultimately dismissed because it was held to be governed exclusively by Article 19 of the Montreal Convention, where cancellation "incurs delay". The remedies under the Convention did not allow for
Page 139 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Miss Graham's claim for damages, especially in view of the fact that punitive/exemplary damages are excluded by
Article 29 of the Convention. Further, Mr Graham's claim was struck out as he had no cause of action as a
stranger to the contract of carriage nor did he have any passenger rights under the Regulation.
Claim dismissed - why appeal?

Upon an application for summary judgment, the District Judge must have been satisfied that the claim had no real prospect of success and that there was no compelling reason for a trial. However, as noted above, this
Regulation has been under constant review at the European level throughout the period of this litigation, and the judge did not rule on whether the Regulation gave rise to a separate cause of action in damages.

The claimant's first appeal, to the High Court, was dismissed, with the Court holding that the Regulation did not provide for a private law cause of action for damages and agreeing with the District Judge that the Montreal Convention exclusively governed the claim and did not support any claim for damages.

However, permission was rather cautiously given for a further appeal to the Court of Appeal on the basis that the Convention might not apply to cancellation (as distinct from a delay or an incident that occurred before boarding). The caution related to other issues that could still preclude recovery under general law.
The appeal - no right to damages under Regulation 261/2004

Ironically, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal without deciding upon the applicability of the Montreal Convention but noted that, since it is a complicated matter of law, it would not be appropriate to grant a summary judgment on this issue.

The issues focussed on whether Miss Graham could sustain a claim for damages, either under the contract of carriage or otherwise. The judges concluded that she could not.

Since the claim was mainly based on Thomas Cook's (unappealed) failure to offer a choice of reimbursement or rerouting to the final destination, as required by Article 8 of the Regulation, the basic problem for the Court was deciding whether:
A breach of Article 8 of Regulation 261/2004 provides for a civil action for damages
If so, were the damages claimed legally sustainable?

In upholding the High Court's view that Article 8 rights do not include a right to damages, the Court noted that remedies for breach of the Regulation in the UK were dealt with by the enabling statutory instrument, which makes breaches a criminal offence (enforceable by the CAA).

The claimant then advanced an argument that Article 12 of the Regulation, which provides that the Regulation "shall apply without prejudice to a passenger's rights for further compensation", allows for a claim outwith the scope of the Regulation. This point was comprehensively dealt with by application of the CJEU's decision in Sousa Rodriguez v Air France in 2012, deciding that additional losses caused by a breach of Article 8 may not be claimed. The term 'further compensation' was held to show that the remedies provided for under Article 8 are not exhaustive and so allows a court to award compensation either under the Montreal Convention or for breach of contract under domestic law.
Other matters of interest - breach of contract and damages for distress at common law

The flight cancellation was not the breach about which the claimants complained, rather it was the failure to comply with contractual obligations post-cancellation. Where such a claim falls outside the Convention, one has to look at the terms of the contract and to general law. Significantly, for Thomas Cook, the contract was for carriage only, rather than a contract for a holiday with a tour operator.

The cancellation of a flight will, almost inherently, cause some distress and anxiety to affected passengers. The claim for damages for distress, however, failed not only because of the application of the Convention but also because damages for distress are permitted only rarely in actions for breach of contract; whereas breach of contract for a holiday is one such case, breach of a simple contract for carriage is not. This gives the curious result that two passengers with identical itineraries and both similarly affected by a flight cancellation will have different rights based simply on the nature of their arrangements.

The claim for the third party's wasted expenditure (relating to an apparent obligation on Miss Graham to make it good) was dismissed as being too remote.
Page 140 of 147 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Conclusion

Not least because of the audacious demand for GBP 50 million in punitive/exemplary damages, this case carries much of interest. Notably, it is significant as the first high level English authority on whether the Regulation provides for a right to damages. Counsel in this case pointed out that, in holding that no such damages are available, the Court of Appeal is consistent with a decision of the German Supreme Court. Such decisions will be likely to have some persuasive authority should this point arise in other jurisdictions.

The case exposes the tension between the Regulation and the Montreal Convention. By holding that there was no right to damages, the Court of Appeal preserved the distinction between the two developed by the CJEU in its decision in IATA v Dept of Transport in 2006. Whereas the Regulation provides for standardised and immediate compensation, it was held not to conflict with Montreal Convention claims, which are assessed individually (on merit) and may require legal proceedings to pursue damages. Short of challenging the IATA distinction, it may be argued that the Court of Appeal had no choice but to avoid finding a right to damages.

It is academically disappointing that the Court did not take the opportunity to provide its opinion on what amounts to 'delay' for the purposes of Article 19 of the Convention. The term is not defined in the text of the Convention and there is no English authority on point. It is understood that there will be no further appeal to the Supreme Court so, for now, this is the end of the matter.

The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

Varadkar: Ryanair-Flybe deal not enough
378 words

An agreement between  Ryanair and the UK's Flybe designed to allay the fears of  European authorities concerned about competition should  Ryanair successfully take over  Aer Lingus  doesn't go far enough, according to Transport minister Leo Varadkar today.

He said the Ryanair-Flybe proposal does not do enough to satisfy the Government that air passengers will be protected in terms of competition and connectivity.

On the revised Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus, Leo Varadkar said what is being put together with Flybe is only for three years.

He said the fact that Ryanair has to give Flybe ''a gift'' of E100m to make it a competitor raises questions. The Minister said the Government does not support the Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus because it thinks it would affect connectivity negatively. This is because IAG will be given the Heathrow slots. Regarding the Government's stake in Aer Lingus, he said the Government has decided that it will dispose of the Aer Lingus stake at the right time, the right price and in the right conditions. Jim French, chief executive of British airline, Flybe, is in Dublin to sell the deal announced last week with Ryanair to create a new carrier as part of a deal with Ryanair to satisfy regulatory concerns over Ryanair's last-ditch bid for Aer Lingus. He has pledged to develop more flights between
Ireland and the UK if the European Commission gives the go-ahead. Under the deal with Ryanair, the new carrier, Flybe Ireland, would receive E100 million and nine aircraft from Ryanair and commit to operating 43 routes for at least three years if Ryanair's Aer Lingus bid succeeds, he said. Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, is making its third attempt to take over rival Aer Lingus and has been told by the European Commission it has one last chance to submit measures to prove the merger will not curb competition. Ryanair will also provide Flybe Ireland with forward sales cash and liabilities worth around E50 million. In return Flybe will pay Ryanair E1 million for the newly created airline. In addition to the Flybe deal, Ryanair will pass Aer Lingus's routes from London's Gatwick Airport to British Airways.

A Lingus: Ryanair had little hope anyway
423 words
12 February 2013
Business and Finance Daily News Service
BNFD

Copyright (c) 2013, Media World Ltd
Aer Lingus  today said that there was never any realistic chance that  Ryanair would have received permission from the EU to take over  Aer Lingus.

It said it noted that  Ryanair had said it has been told by the  EU that its bid for  Aer Lingus  has been rejected but that the  EU has not been in touch with it on any decision reached.

"As indicated in our statement of 20 June 2012 at the outset of the bid, there was significant uncertainty that the offer from Ryanair was ever capable of completion. Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus was prohibited
in 2007 on competition grounds. Aer Lingus is a much stronger airline today than it was at the time of the previous Ryanair offers and is Ryanair's only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes. The number of routes into and out of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete has sharply increased since 2007," the Aer Lingus statement said.

"The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger in this instance than with the previous offers. Therefore, it was and remains Aer Lingus' position that the offer should never have been made." "As indicated on 6 February
2013, in our preliminary results announcement, Aer Lingus delivered an excellent overall performance in 2012. During 2012, the Company increased operating profit, total revenue, passenger numbers, average yields, load factors and market share. Aer Lingus is well positioned for future growth and continues to implement its successful 'value carrier' business model. We look forward to continuing to serve our customers and to providing choice for consumers in the markets we serve." Following Ryanair's announcement regarding the EC investigation, Aer Lingus said it looks forward to continuing to assist the UK Competition Commission (UKCC) in
its ongoing investigation into the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding. On 15 June 2012, the Office of Fair Trading referred Ryanair's minority shareholding to the UKCC for review, concluding that "there is a realistic prospect that its stake has resulted or will result in a substantial lessening of competition." "Ryanair has
on a number of occasions attempted to halt this separate UKCC investigation, including by means of its third hostile takeover offer. Aer Lingus now looks forward to the conclusion of the UKCC investigation. As indicated previously it is Aer Lingus' position that Ryanair, as our largest competitor should be required to divest its shareholding in Aer Lingus," Aer Lingus said.

EU reject RyanairAer  Lingus  takeover

According to Ryanair, the European Commission has told Ryanair it will reject the low-cost carrier's attempt to take over Aer Lingus.

Ryanair described the decision as unfair and political.
But European Commission said a final decision had not yet been taken.

Ryanair, which has indicated that this third bid for Aer Lingus would be its last, said it would launch an appeal in European courts against the decision by the Commission, which acts as the European Union's competition authority. "It appears clear from this morning's meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said in a statement following a meeting with Commission representatives. "This decision is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law," he said. The government, which has said it is against the merger, declined to comment, as did an Aer Lingus spokesman. Aer Lingus's shares were 5 percent lower at 1.27 euros by lunchtime, when Ryanair's shares were unchanged at 5.67 euros. Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, was told last month that it had one last
chance to submit measures to ensure the proposed 694 million-euro merger did not reduce competition. Ryanair's latest offer to the Commission included ceding 43 routes to Flybe and hand to British Airways the routes Aer Lingus operates from London's Gatwick Airport. The Commission blocked Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus in 2007 and Ryanair dropped its second in 2009. "The Commission will take a decision in this case at the end of February or the beginning of March," said a spokesman for EU competition chief Joaquin Almunia,
declining to comment further on the Ryanair statement.

The European Commission intends to block  Ryanair's planned purchase of  Aer Lingus,  according to a  Ryanair statement, which added that the carrier would appeal such a move.  Ryanair claimed to have "met every competition concern raised" during the review process, "including providing the  European Union—at its request—with irrevocable commitments from not one, but two upfront buyers to eliminate all competitive overlaps between Ryanair and Aer Lingus,"  a proposed remedy that it called "unprecedented." Those buyers, according
to Ryanair, are IAG, parent of British Airways and Iberia, which agreed to acquire all of Ryanair's and Aer            Lingus' London Gatwick operations, and Flybe, which would assume control over 43 Aer Lingus  routes. "It appears clear ... that no matter what remedies  Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," according to a statement attributed to  Ryanair head of communications Robin Kiely.
"Ryanair has no alternative but to appeal any prohibition decision." Document BTN0000020130213e92c0000c

Ryanair to Appeal Aer Lingus  Takeover Decision

LONDON--Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY) on Tuesday said it would appeal an expected decision by  European regulators to block its takeover of Irish carrier  Aer Lingus  PLC (EIL1.DB), despite offering "unprecedented" remedies to maintain competition on Irish routes.
The discount airline said it had been notified by the European Commission that the regulator intended to block the
694 million euro ($930.3 million) takeover--Ryanair's third attempt at a merger--during a meeting ahead of a
March 6 deadline for a decision.

"It appears clear from this morning's meeting, that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair said, adding that it will appeal the decision in European courts.

Ryanair currently holds 29.8% in Aer Lingus. The Irish government, which has a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, opposed the bid.

The news comes just 10 days after Ryanair submitted the latest in a string of concession packages to secure approval to acquire Aer Lingus, after the Commission--the European Union's regulatory arm--signaled that remedies proposed earlier were insufficient.

In the latest package, regional carrier Flybe Group PLC (FLYB.LN) would have taken over 43 Aer Lingus routes, guaranteeing EUR20 million in annual profit as well as a EUR100 million upfront payment for Flybe. The aim was to convince the Commission that Flybe was a credible competitor to Ryanair despite issuing several profit warnings over the past two years and cuts to its U.K. workforce, announced last month.

Ryanair had also proposed to transfer all of Aer Lingus's routes between London Gatwick and Ireland to British Airways, a unit of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (ICAGY), or IAG. Under the previous package, British Airways would instead have received the routes between London Heathrow and Ireland.

"Given Ryanair's remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU's statement of objections, any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules," said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely. "Ryanair has no alternative but to appeal any prohibition decision."
But others have noted the difference between the business models operated by Flybe and the two Irish airlines. "How can Flybe compete with Ryanair? It's impossible. It's the classic motivation of the corporate raider," Aer
Lingus Chief Executive Christoph Mueller said in an interview last week. "You can manipulate any marketplace
with artificial competitors. Ryanair would even write the business plan for Flybe--this is very, very flawed," Mr.
Mueller added.

Aer Lingus on Tuesday said it hadn't been notified of any decision from the commission and that it intends to oppose Ryanair's offer for the company.

Ryanair and rival low-cost airline easyJet PLC (ESYJY) have ramped up pressure on national carriers already squeezed by high fuel costs and a sluggish economy.

Earlier on Tuesday, IAG said its Spanish unit Iberia had started the formal process of collective redundancy for over 3,807 jobs, as part of its plans to cut capacity by 15%. And Deutsche Lufthansa AG (DLAKY), Europe's

biggest airline by passengers; smaller German rival Air Berlin PLC (AB1.XE); and Air France, owned by Air
France-KLM SA (AF.FR), are all reorganizing their operations to stem losses.
