ITALY AND FRANCE SEEK EC RETHINK ON DE HAVILLAND SALE VETO.

LUXEMBOURG, Oct 7, Reuter - France and Italy, furious with the  European  Commission for blocking a buyout of commuter aircraft maker de  Havilland  of Canada by their leading aerospace firms, on Monday sought a rethink of the decision.
"France and Italy have asked the  Commission to reexamine this decision," French Transport Minister Paul
Quiles told a joint news conference here with Italian Transport Minister Carlo Bernini.
Last Wednesday the EC's executive used its merger control powers for the first time to bar France's state-run
Aerospatiale and Alenia SpA of Italy from buying the Boeing Co's loss-making commuter aircraft subsidiary.

Commission officials say reversal of the veto is impossible now, adding that it can only be challenged by an appeal in the EC's Court of Justice, a move which could take several years to conclude.

Quiles and Bernini said that Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, who proposed the veto, was putting too much weight on competition issues and not enough on industrial policy in blocking the merger.
"If Mr Brittan had intervened 20 years ago, maybe we wouldn't have the successes of Airbus and Ariane
(European space group)," France's Quiles said.

Brussels' growing clout as a watchdog for EC industry has pitted it against governments in the past but rarely caused a national outcry of this scale, including a spate of personal attacks on French Commission President Jacques Delors.
French foreign minister Roland Dumas took the unprecedented step of voicing his objections to the veto during an
EC foreign ministers meeting over the weekend, saying EC merger control "should strengthen the
competitiveness of European industry, not hinder it".
The Commission blocked the sale on the grounds that acquisition of Toronto-based de Havilland would leave the
Franco-Italian group dominating the EC and global commuter aircraft industry.
Aerospatiale's managing director Yves Michot was expected in Brussels later on Monday to discuss the EC
decision with Delors' chief adviser.

Quiles hinted that there might be a way to repackage the takeover offer to make it more acceptable to the Commission which stopped the deal on the grounds that the European firms would have an "unassailable" dominant position in the market for turbo-prop commuter planes.
But Commission officials said it was unlikely that a newly packaged deal could get EC approval if it would leave
Alenia and Aerospatiale in control of de Havilland.

EC, CITING `UNASSAILABLE  DOMINANCE,' BLOCKS DE HAVILLAND PURCHASE

The European Community, citing what it described as an "unassailable dominance" in regional aircraft that would be established by the merger, last week blocked the purchase  of Boeing's de Havilland  Canada commuter aircraft division by Alenia e Selenia SpA of Italy and Aerospatiale SNI of France. The merger, the ECcommission said, would have "an unacceptable impact on customers and the balance of competition in the European community market."

The merger seemed likely to be blocked because of the opposition of Sir Leon Brittan, the  EC's commissioner for competition, although other commissioners had sought approval for the  deal. A task force established a year ago to investigate large  mergers, however, had voiced "serious doubts" about the proposed  takeover of de
Havilland.

Brittan had already won one battle the week before when the commission's advisory committee on concentrations backed its recommendation to block the deal. Only representatives from France and Italy voted in the minority.

France and Italy Blast EC Ruling On de Havilland

MAARSSEN, the Netherlands -- Representatives of France's  Aerospatiale SA and Italy's Alenia SpA will visit the
European Community Commission today, after a furious controversy erupted over the commission's decision
to block their  takeover of Boeing Co.'s de  Havilland  unit.

At a weekend meeting of  EC foreign ministers to discuss political union, the French and Italian governments took the unusual step of insisting that the issue of de  Havilland,  a commercial aircraft maker, be put on the agenda.

Both governments expressed their dissatisfaction with the commission's ruling, arguing that it undermines the chances for European companies to compete successfully on the international stage.

This has put Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, in the uncomfortable position of having to defend the commission's ruling and his role in the move. Mr. Delors is known to have opposed the decision to block the takeover, a ruling that was based on a recommendation by Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner. Sir Leon contended that the takeover would give the companies a dominant position in the market for commuter turboprop planes, hampering competition in the trade bloc.

Mr. Delors said that he had explained to the ministers that the EC is "a community of laws," and that the member states are free to appeal commission decisions to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. He flatly rejected accusations by French politicians and in the French press, that he had failed to defend his country's interest by abstaining from the commission's vote on de Havilland.

"The commission is not a presidential regime," a visibly irritated Mr. Delors said. The official said that his job was to try to find a consensus among 17 commissioners from 12 countries and all ranges of the political spectrum. In cases in which he isn't "100% in favor" of a commission decision, Mr. Delors said he normally choses to abstain.
Other EC ministers also appeared frustrated by the call for the case to be discussed at the weekend meeting. "This is not a matter for the Council of Ministers," British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said. According to Mr.
Hurd, a similar view was expressed firmly during the meeting by Hans van den Broek, the Dutch foreign minister
whose country currently holds the EC presidency.

The representatives of the two aerospace companies are expected to try to discuss with Brussels whether they can revise their bid in order to have the purchase approved. Commission officials, however, have said that such a scenario appears unlikely, given the narrow product range in question.

The fact that Mr. Delors was so outspoken about the case reflects the degree of controversy that the ruling has caused in France, with some newspapers suggesting that the commission president might resign over the matter. Mr. Delors said the French government "had nothing to complain about" regarding decisions by the commission, which in the past has gone some way toward meeting the concerns of Paris.

French politicians have accused Brussels of selling out French interests. The outcry -- from both left and right wings -- provides strong support for French Prime Minister Edith Cresson, who called on Brussels to review the ruling immediately, and threatened to appeal the decision to the European Court of Justice.

Coming only months after a controversial EC-Japanese car accord that was interpreted widely in Paris as damaging to French interests, the de Havilland ruling has acted as a catalyst for the resentment felt against the commission staff and what is perceived as their power to dictate national policy.

"Yes to democrats, no to technocrats," fumed Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy during a radio interview. "We should use this example to remind the commission in Brussels that it isn't all-powerful."

Other politicians were equally outspoken. Transport Minister Paul Quiles called the veto "scandalous" while former right wing Prime Minister Jacques Chirac slammed it as "an unjust decision, contrary to the interests of Europe."

EC chief defends de Havilland  decision

HAARZUILEN, Netherlands (Reuter) - European Commission President Jacques Delors yesterday defended the commission's decision to block a French-Italian takeover of Canadian commuter aircraft manufacturer de Havilland.

He said representatives of the French  Aerospatiale group, one of the companies in the thwarted  merger, would meet with the  commission today to discuss alternatives to the  deal.

But in response to a spate of criticism from French politicians to last Wednesday's decision, Delors reiterated that the EC's merger control laws could not be twisted.
Delors, who is seen as a possible future prime minister and likely candidate to succeed President Francois
Mitterrand, suggested some might be attacking him because of his high standing in recent opinion polls.
"I have a perfectly clear conscience. I defend the commission's decision," he said.
"The commission president does not make the rain fall and the sun shine," said Delors, who abstained from
Wednesday's vote after registering his objections privately.

Under rules agreed upon two years ago, the 17-member commission has the right to block large mergers if they would damage competition in the Community.

It ruled Wednesday that state-run Aerospatiale and Alenia of Italy could not buy U.S.-based Boeing Co.'s loss-making subsidiary de Havilland because it would give them too dominant a position in the market for turbo-prop commuter aircraft.

It was the first deal blocked out of more than 50 mergers investigated by the commission since it won the veto powers.
France has said it intends to appeal the decision.

In a radio interview in Paris yesterday, Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said the commission was acting outside its jurisdiction and needed to be brought into line.

"The commission is not the alpha and omega of European construction," Beregovoy said, saying the question was whether the commission would allow Europe to compete effectively with Japan and the United States.

De Havilland announced in Toronto Friday it planned to cut its workforce from 4,200 to 2,900 next year because of reduced orders for its Dash 8 commuter airliner.

FRANCE, ITALY URGE NEW VOTE ON DE HAVILLAND

France and Italy yesterday urged the  European Community's executive commission to reconsider its decision to veto a Franco-Italian  purchase  of the Canadian aircraft company de Havilland.
"This is worrying for the future," Italian Transport Minister Carlo Bernini told reporters during a meeting with his 11
European Community counterparts here. "The whole industry is at stake."

He and French Transport Minister Paul Quiles said they were considering ways to force a re-examination or to skirt the commission's authority over takeovers by companies based in the 12-nation trade bloc.
"We have to consider other ways to proceed," Quiles said.

Last week, the EC commission vetoed the purchase of de Havilland by GIE Avions de Transport Regional, a joint venture of Italy's Alenia e Selenia SpA and France's Aerospatiale SNI. The venture is known as ATR.

It said the link-up would give ATR-de Havilland an "unassailable dominant position" in the world commuter aircraft market.

In a deal estimated by some analysts at $200 million, The Boeing Co. agreed in May to sell de Havilland to Alenia and Aerospatiale.

Boeing paid the Canadian government about $110 million for de Havilland in 1986 and poured hundreds of millions of dollars into modernization, research, development and other improvements. It put the company up for sale last year when it lost $30 million.

Last Wednesday's EC ruling against ATR has caused a wave of criticism, especially in France. On Sunday, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy charged the commission had abused its power and was undermining the competitiveness of EC industry. jk/dh

Brittan  denounces pressures on EC Commission in De Havilland  case

(Copyright 1991)
STRASBOURG, France, Oct 8 (AFP) -  European Community competition commissioner Sir Leon Brittan on Tuesday denounced political pressures against the EC Commission in the De Havilland  case, and had to cope with a number of sharp criticisms by French members of the European Parliament.

After explaining to the European Parliament the commission's recent veto of the  acquisition of Canada's De Havilland  aircraft company by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy on grounds that it would weaken competition in the computer aircraft field, Sir Leon noted that EC governments opposed to the decision could appeal to the  European Court of Justice.
He said that would be better than called on the EC Council of Ministers to try to get the decision reversed.
The Commission's move has come under intense criticism in France, even though voted by nine of the 17 EC
commissioners.

During the discussion, he was strongly attacked by the majority of French members of the European Parliament for the "sinister and dangerous" role played by the Commission in the affair.
Some British members said they were shocked by the virulence of the French members' attacks. csg/hl AFP AFP SEQN-0393

On Sunday, Mr. Delors declared "in its statement to the press,  Aerospatiale reacted brutally, although more realistically in private, calling for a meeting to examine conditions under which the company could pursue the commercial policy it had started. I told Mr. Michot that he could visit the  Commission on Monday". For the whole case see following pages.

DELORS ANSWERS CRITICISM OF DE HAVILLAND TAKEOVER BAN.

Delors answers criticism on the  commission's negative decision in the De Havilland  affair - The French and
Italian transport ministers speak of the need to revise the regulation on concentrations.

HAARZUILEN, 07/10/1991 (AGENCE  EUROPE) - The French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas used the Gymnich-type meeting held over the week-end (see other news in PD) to express France's disappointment following the  European  Commission's opposition to the  purchase  of De Havilland  by Aerospatiale (France) and Alenia (Italy). "You knocked at the wrong door", his colleagues are reported to have replied and, according to the Belgian minister, Mark Eyskens, advised him to go to the Court of Justice. Severely criticised by French politicians, Jacques Delors, for his part, jumped on the occasion to dot the Is, fully defending the institution of which he is president.

"I fully back the decision, full stop!": is what President Delors announced, saying he was "concerned" over the offensive made against the Commission, stressing that its president was simply "primus inter pares". He had discussed it with the Commissioner responsible, Sir Leon Brittan, but that, as always, the decision had been taken by the Commission as a whole. Abstention was, for the president, the only possibility "when not 100% in
agreement". "I am getting a bad trial", Mr. Delors added, and concluded with this point: "The member States must know that the Commission was not a presidential regime. The role of the president is to get 17 people representing a wide range of politics to work together".

Worse, in attacking the Commission, it is "the whole of the institutional system which is being questioned". Comment by President Delors: "For France, it is a bad way to start the debate on the institutional future of the Community". More so, he insisted, in that other affairs (Pechiney, Air France/UTA, Renault...) should the possibility of satisfactory solutions for all concerned. And he stressed that one had to "distinguish the rules of law and the role" that the Commission has to play in order to "promote an efficient and prosperous European industry". Legally, the Commission can do nothing, but it "could re-examine a new offer". "We are now faced with an industrial problem" which needs to be solved. The Commission is prepared to find a satisfactory solution with the two European companies for their industrial strategy and within the regulation over concentrations.

Ministers Quiles and Bernini do not want competition to be the only motor in the construction industry. In refusing the takeover of De Havilland by Aerospatiale and Alenia, "the Commission has taken a step of extreme importance, vital even, for governments and European entrepreneurs". This is what the French Transport Minister Paul Quiles said at a press conference he gave with his Italian counterpart Carlo Bernini on the fringe of the Transport Council in Luxembourg on Monday. In the session, the two ministers called on the Commission to review the dossier and gave their appreciation of the "firm and faultless" position taken by the Commissioner responsible for transport. Replying, Karel Van Miert said he would transmit the message to his colleagues. While affirming his "duty of solidarity", Mr. Van Miert said that personally he had always hoped for better harmony between competition, industrial and transport policies, and hoping for a "re-balance" from now on.

At the press conference, the French and Italian ministers were very harsh. Thus, Mr. Quiles notably put forward the following argument: France does not "dispute the legal basis" for the Commission's decision, but the "reasoning" based on "an analysis resting on the fragmentation of the plane market which is highly debatable"; - this decision goes "against the interests of the european aeronautical industry", which leads "us to wonder about what concept of Europe we really want"; - the strategy has to rest on "the setting up of an ambitious industrial policy" and the "weapons" to use, "it is to our companies that we must give weight", which was the case in the rejected operation". Thus, the Commission has taken a position which "disarms Europe"; - it is an "important drift" and, consequently, "it would be useful to reaffirm the objectives in the construction of Europe"; - "It is imperative that the Commission does not simply watch over competition: we need real rules of play in industrial policy as competition is raging in all sectors". In short, "competition cannot become the only motor in European construction".

Same disappointment for Carlo Bernini who said that the decision was "worrying" beyond the case of De Havilland as it was "industry as a whole that was at stake". And the Italian minister hoped that the debate that started on Monday morning would "contribute to the definition of sure rules:, the Commission being asked to think about it.

In reply to various questions, the two Ministers stated: - that the United Kingdom and the Netherlands backed the Commission decision, making any "commentary superfluous" (Quiles); - given "the turmoil and the basic problem," Italy and France called on the Commission to "reexamine" its decision; - "a revision of the merger regulation may be needed if we wish to prevent any similar decisions" (Quiles); - according to Mr. Quiles, "if Sir
Leon Brittan had intervened twenty years ago," Airbus and Ariane-Espace may not have experienced the success they enjoy today; - if the current state of legislation does not permit a revocation of this decision, another way of proceeding, from an industrial standpoint, will have to be sought (Quiles); - did Sir Leon Brittan defend national interests? Mr. Quiles (who does not want to believe this) said such a move "would signal the end of Europe." As
to the Court of Justice, it can merely provide "moral and posthumous satisfaction."

EUROPE believes that Luxembourg has lent support to the Franco-Italian request for a genuine industrial policy and that the British and Dutch delegations have allegedly agreed to the principle of discussion of this subject at the Industry Council.

Top EC Official  Hits Back At French Over De Havilland

STRASBOURG, France -DJ- The European Community's top competition official lambasted French allegations
of unfairness over the EC Commission's decision to block the  takeover of Canada's commuter aircraft maker de
Havilland,  by Aerospatiale of France and Italy's  Alenia SpA, on competition grounds.

Speaking to the  European Parliament,  Commission Vice-president Sir Leon Brittan said ''it is quite absurd...to make the suggestion...that the  merger regulation has been applied in any way that is unfair to France.''

He said the commission wouldn't bow to pressure from France and Italy to re-examine the case. The only way forward for the two companies is to challenge the decision before the European Court of Justice, he said.

Hope stirs for de Havilland

A delegation from France's  Aerospatiale SpA met with top officials from the European Community Commission
yesterday in an apparent bid to breathe new life into the blocked de Havilland  takeover.
The team, headed by  Aerospatiale vice-president Yves Michot, met top officials from  Commission President
Jacques Delors' cabinet to ''see how things can develop,'' a company spokesman said.
''I believe they want to find out the possibility of a new deal being resurrected,'' said Delors' spokesman. Neither side was willing to say more about the meeting, which both said the other had demanded.
Last week, the EC Commission vetoed the purchase of Toronto-based de Havilland by Aerospatiale and Italy's
Alenia SpA from the Boeing Co. of Seattle, Wash. It said the linkup would give the merged companies an
''unassailable dominant position'' in the world commuter aircraft market.

The ban provoked a political uproar in France and Italy, including attacks on Delors and calls for reform of the one-year-old merger regulation.
''This is worrying for the future,'' Italian Transport Minister Carlo Bernini told reporters during a meeting with his 11
European Community counterparts. ''The whole industry is at stake.''

The EC veto also sparked a new round of lobbying closer to home, with the Ontario government meeting representatives of Boeing, de Havilland, and the would-be buyers to discuss the possibility of a new deal acceptable to the EC.
Premier Bob Rae said it was too early to predict the outcome of talks.
''It will be a few days before the dust settles,'' he said.

Federal Trade Minister Michael Wilson has refused to consider investing in de Havilland, remaining adamant that the next step is up to Boeing, Aerospatiale and Alenia.

De Havilland, which has been trimming its staff over the past year, Friday announced that 1,300 more jobs will be eliminated in the first half of 1992. It cited weak orders for its Dash-8 planes.

The prohibition of the merger was the first issued under the EC competition law giving the commission broad powers to approve or reject major mergers and acquisition.
Paul Quiles, French Transport minister, said in Luxembourg yesterday: ''It seems to me imperative that the
Commission should not content itself with looking at competition [criteria!. It's not enough.''

President  threatens  to quit amid row over Aerospatiale's failed bid for De Havilland.

An angry Jacques Delors has turned on his friends in the French government and threatened to resign as  EC president in a sequel to a  European  Commission refusal to allow France's  Aerospatiale to buy the Canadian De Havilland  plane company.

Four of the most powerful members of the government, attacked him for failing to oppose the British fair-trading commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, who organised a veto on the  deal.

The row between the government and Mr Delors, who is strongly tipped to succeed Francois Mitterrand in 1995, seemed unlikely to be defused by a re-examination of Aerospatiale's bid yesterday after its rejection on Wednesday. Mr Delors said the French would have to appeal to the European Court of Justice, even though he was against the basis of Sir Leon's decision.

At first, irritation was concentrated against Sir Leon, who is seen in Paris as a Thatcherite determined to reduce the EC's political future.

In a vote last Wednesday, nine members of the 17-member commission supported Sir Leon's opposition to a takeover of De Havilland by a consortium led by Aerospatiale and the Italian company, Alenia. Mr Delors abstained. The takeover was considered to be unfair as it would have given the consortium two-thirds of the European market for passenger planes of 20-70 seats, and 50 per cent of the world market.
After press allegations that Sir Leon preferred a possible bid from British Aerospace, political leaders turned on
Mr Delors. The Prime Minister, Edith Cresson, said the decision was "scandalous".

BRITTAN REJECTS CRITICISM OF DE HAVILLAND STANCE.
462 words
8 October 1991

(c) 1991 Reuters Limited
STRASBOURG, France, Oct 8, Reuter - Sir Leon Brittan,  European Commissioner for Competition, hit out at critics of the European Commission's decision last week to block the  takeover of Boeing Co's De  Havilland  unit by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia SpA of Italy.
Speaking to the  European Parliament, he said French allegations of unfairness were absurd.

"Their absurdity is only equalled by their offensiveness," he said, naming 23 French companies whose merger plans had been approved.

Brittan called arguments that Japan and the U.S. would benefit if the merger did not go ahead "completely irrelevant...a red herring."

He said no responsible competition authority could have come to a different view about the dominance the proposed alliance would have created.

He said the decision affected turbo-propeller-powered commuter aircraft, a particularly distinct segment. If the merger had been allowed, the new group would have had 64 pct of the world market and 72 pct of the EC market in aircraft seating 40-59 passengers, he said.
Taking all relevant commuter aircraft, the group would have held 50 pct of the world market and 64 pct of the EC
market. The European Court of Justice holds that a 50 pct holding is evidence of a dominant position.

Brittan said there was no justification for confusing the issue by considering jets in the same breath. "Those who seek to draw it into this debate are seeking to pluck arguments out of thin air where none exist," he said.
Jets were a distinct market, costing twice as much as the aircraft he was considering, he said.

Brittan said he was unpersuaded by Aerospatiale's arguments that Indonesia and the Soviet Union would be serious competitors if the merger did not go ahead.

The U.S. and Japan were not serious competition for the EC in this particular market, he said. "In this case, whatever may be true elsewhere, there is no such threat," he said.

The Japanese were not in this market at all, and Boeing was in the process of bowing out, which is what made the idea of the merger possible in the first place, he said.

Brittan said that if the merger had gone ahead, EC industry would not have been strengthened. On the contrary, jobs would have been seriously at risk throughout the industry as the giant flexed its muscles, he said.
He called on critics to take the issue to the European Court of Justice if they were not satisfied with the decision. The Transport Ministers of Italy and France on Monday asked the Commission to reexamine its decision, saying
that in blocking the merger Brittan was putting too much weight on competition issues and not enough on
industrial policy.

Transport Ministers urge new look at ATR bid for De Havilland.
By From Tom Walker in Brussels.

The Italian and French transport ministers yesterday joined the attack on the European Commission, demanding that Sir Leon Brittan rethink his decision to block ATR's bid for De Havilland  of Canada.

A first  merger veto passed by the  commission since it was given extended powers in competition policy more than a year ago has caused political turmoil, embroiling Jacques Delors, the  commission president, in a French domestic row that has spilt over onto the  EC stage.

Despite the fact that M Delors could not have influenced the outcome of the commissioner's vote on the ATR bid, which went 9-4 in favour of Sir Leon, and because the vast majority of competition experts in Brussels confirmed the commission had an open-and-shut case, the Italian and French governments will not let the matter drop. Paul Quiles, the French transport minister, said yesterday in Luxembourg at a joint press conference with Carlo
Bernini, his Italian counterpart: "France and Italy have asked the commission to re-examine this decision." ATR is jointly owned by Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia.

The French government argues that strengthening Europe's industrial base is more important than ensuring free competition in the 12-member trade board. These sentiments were again echoed by the French foreign ministry in Paris yesterday.

The barrage of complaints has led the commission to prepare a 22-page document justifying its decision. The document rejects all the following arguments:

That the commission has produced misleading figures, and that all commuter turbo props in circulation should be counted in market share figures, thus bringing the combined global market of De Havilland and ATR beneath
50%.

That in a worldwide and intensely competitive industry like aerospace, a bridgehead into the North American market is vital. De Havilland of Toronto would have provided that.
The merger would create jobs in Europe.
If the commission had acted like this previously, Airbus would never have been possible.

In order to try and diffuse the situation, Yves Michot, the managing director of Aerospatiale, was invited to Brussels yesterday to meet the head of the Delors cabinet. A commission source said that previously, M Michot had acknowledged that De Havilland would be of little consequence to ATR's overall future strategy. Aerospatiale had no comment yesterday.

Italy, France seek EC review of de Havilland  sale rejection

LUXEMBOURG (Reuter) - France and Italy, furious with the  European  Commission for blocking a buyout  of commuter aircraft maker de  Havilland  of Canada by their leading aerospace firms, have sought a review of the decision.
"France and Italy have asked the  commission to re-examine this decision," French Transport Minister Paul
Quiles yesterday told a joint news conference here with Italian Transport Minister Carlo Bernini.

Last Wednesday, the commission's executive used its merger control powers for the first time to bar France's state-run Aerospatiale and Alenia SpA of Italy from buying Downsview-based de Havilland from parent Boeing Co.

Quiles and Bernini said that Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, who proposed the veto, was putting too much weight on competition issues and not enough on industrial policy in blocking the merger.
"If Mr. Brittan had intervened 20 years ago, maybe we wouldn't have the successes of Airbus and Ariane
(European space group)," France's Quiles said.
The commission blocked the sale on the grounds that acquisition of Toronto-based de Havilland would leave the
Franco-Italian group dominating the European Community and global commuter aircraft industry.

Meanwhile, a delegation from Aerospatiale met top officials of the EC Commission in Brussels yesterday in an apparent bid to breathe new life into the blocked takeover bid.
The team, headed by Aerospatiale vice-president Yves Michot, met top officials from commission president
Jacques Delors's cabinet to "see how things can develop," a company spokesperson said.
"I believe they want to find out the possibility of a new deal being resurrected," said Delors's spokesperson. Neither side was willing to say more about the meeting.

FRANCE, ITALY URGE NEW VOTE ON DE HAVILLAND

France and Italy yesterday urged the  European Community's executive commission to reconsider its decision to veto a Franco-Italian  purchase  of the Canadian aircraft company de Havilland.
``This is worrying for the future,'' Italian Transport Minister Carlo Bernini told reporters during a meeting with his
11 European Community counterparts here. ``The whole industry is at stake.''

He and French Transport Minister Paul Quiles said they were considering ways to force a re-examination or to skirt the commission's authority over takeovers by companies based in the 12-nation trade bloc.
``We have to consider other ways to proceed,'' Quiles said.

Last week, the EC commission vetoed the purchase of de Havilland by GIE Avions de Transport Regional, a joint venture of Italy's Alenia e Selenia SpA and France's Aerospatiale SNI. The venture is known as ATR.

It said the link-up would give ATR-de Havilland an ``unassailable dominant position'' in the world commuter aircraft market.

In a deal estimated by some analysts at $200 million, The Boeing Co. agreed in May to sell de Havilland to Alenia and Aerospatiale.

Boeing paid the Canadian government about $110 million for de Havilland in 1986 and poured hundreds of millions of dollars into modernization, research, development and other improvements. It put the company up for sale last year when it lost $30 million.

Last Wednesday's EC ruling against ATR has caused a wave of criticism, especially in France. On Sunday, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy charged the commission had abused its power and was undermining the competitiveness of EC industry.

French government wants new Brussels look at De Havilland  deal

PARIS, Oct 9 (AFP) - French European affairs minister Elisabeth Guigou on Wednesday urged reconsideration of the De  Havilland  affair by the European Community Commission, and said if that does not come about, the French government might appeal to the European Court of Justice.

She was speaking of the Commission's recent veto of acquisition of Canada's De  Havilland  aircraft manufacturer by Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia. The veto came on competitive grounds.
Mrs. Guigou told the National Assembly that Aerospatiale chairman Henri Martre was to meet with EC
competition commissioner Sir Leon Brittan to discuss the issue. The veto has raised a huge outcry in France.

The minister called the decision "surprising and shocking", adding that "We cannot accept having the Commission make decisions as a function of an abstract and ignorant vision of European industrial reality, of a liberal ideology that appears to me to be exceptionally naive".

She urged a new joint examination of the case by the companies involved and the Commission to try to reach a decision "more in conformity with European industry's interests".

BRUSSELS, 08/10/1991 (AGENCE  EUROPE) - As announced in EUROPE yesterday, the Head of Mr. Delors' Cabinet, Pascal Lamy, received in Brussels the Managing Director of Aerospatiale, Mr. Michot, for a review of the problem as a whole from the competition point of view, the aspect of marketing strategy of the company concerning the De Havilland/ATR  operation. The next stage in seeking an alternative to the  purchase  of the
Canadian aeronautics manufacturer by Aerospatiale-Alenia has now begun and company jurists must formulate a proposal that would be acceptable to the Commission. EUROPE recalls that last Thursday, Sir Leon Brittan, Commissioner charged with competition matters, said he was willing to examine any new proposal that would not be a "simple legal dressing up" of the project rejected by the  Commission.

STRASBOURG, 08/10/1991 (AGENCE EUROPE) - Sir Leon Brittan defended, on Tuesday evening before the
Parliament, the controversial Commission decision in the De  Havilland/ATR  affair. The regulation of December
1989, recalled Sir Leon, has been adopted after sixteen years of negotiations, with the unanimity and support of
the European Parliament. It is "absurd", he added, to say that the regulation was applied in a way that damages
French industry, and it is also "offensive". In 52 cases, application of the directive has resulted in authorisation to
merger, recalls Sir Leon, and out of these 52 cases, 23 involved French firms.

Commissioner for competition policy  hits back at blocked  takeover of De Havilland  by ATR.

From David Usborne in Strasbourg
Sir Leon Brittan last night attacked the French government and French media for their "abusive" campaign
against last week's  European  Commission decision to block the  takeover of the aircraft maker De  Havilland  by
the Franco-Italian consortium ATR.
Defending the move before the European Parliament, Sir Leon furiously denounced accusations that the
Commission was using its powers to vet Europe-wide mergers to victimise French industry.

Sir Leon, the EC commissioner responsible for competition policy, reiterated that a merger between De Havilland and ATR - a consortium of Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia - would have led to unfair domination by the new group of the turboprop commuter aircraft market in the EC and worldwide.
In a clear reference to British Aerospace and Fokker of the Netherlands, he told MEPs that the proposed merger
"would have made other European companies, notably in Britain and the Netherlands, extremely vulnerable".

The Commission, and especially Sir Leon and its president Jacques Delors, have been vilified by the French press and politicians since the decision a week ago.

The onslaught reached a peak at the weekend when the French foreign minister, Roland Dumas, raised the matter with his 11 EC counterparts. Sir Leon, who was hoarse after his intervention in Strasbourg, even attempted to ridicule Henri Martre, the chairman of Aerospatiale, who had tried to sway the Commission by suggesting that the merged group would face effective competition from Indonesia and the Soviet Union.

One criticism is that Sir Leon was too restrictive in his definition of commuter aircraft, for example, in refusing to consider jets as part of the relevant market. "He virtually defined the market on the number of toilets and hostesses in an aircraft", an unsympathetic EC official suggested.

Implicitly attacking Mr Dumas, Sir Leon expressed particular disgust at the political pressure the French government was attempting to apply at the highest EC levels to get the decision overturned. This was bully-boy tactics, he said.

"If that was allowed to happen the interest of the smaller states would lose out," he added. "It would be a question of who shouts the loudest."

Howls of outrage at scuppered bid by ATR for De Havilland.
By George Brock.

When Sir Leon Brittan persuaded the  European  Commission to stop a Franco-Italian consortium from  buying  a
Canadian aerospace firm, he lit the fuse for a political explosion which is still reverberating across the community.

Sir Leon had swung a few key votes to make the first real use of the European Community's tough powers to block mergers likely to suffocate free competition in the  EC. Aerospatiale, the French aeronautics giant whose purchase  of the aircraft makers De  Havilland  was refused, had been convinced that its bid would be allowed. Howls of outrage followed from Paris.

Sir Leon's victory was a significant gain in the free marketeers' fight to carve out rules which will promote competition against the calls for an EC "industrial policy". France and Italy, backed by the weaker southern economies of the EC, are arguing more vocally than ever for schemes to subsidise European firms in world markets. Sir Leon doggedly pursues his quest for real competition in a hostile political climate and with a small band of unreliable allies on the 17-member commission.

With the single market of 1992 looming and the arrival of the protectionist Edith Cresson at the head of the French government, the spirit of the 17th-century mercantilist statesman Jean-Baptiste Colbert lives on in Paris. Sir Leon, who last year only managed to force the French car manufacturer Renault to repay half of an enormous government subsidy, faces further battles this year over planned state money for Air France and the Italian car manufacturer Fiat.

The outburst of French indignation at the blocking of the De Havilland bid produced a rich crop of ironies for governments and individuals who previously have been sneered by the French for lacking enthusiasm for Europe. The French press is now filled with daily denunciations of the EC for overstepping its powers. A string of French ministers have been paraded to propose rewriting the community's rules so that the affront can be reversed and any repetition prevented. The ministers seldom mention that the merger regulation received the unanimous
assent of all 12 governments in 1989.

The episode has stripped away the mask of European rhetoric which French politicians habitually use to cover national economic policy. "What this shows," said one EC official, "is that as far as the French are concerned, if Europe isn't France, it isn't Europe.

"They have run the community as a major part of their foreign policy: look at the way Delors has been put on the spot. He was interviewed about the De Havilland decision as if he was a national minister being asked to justify a domestic policy."

The principal target of the broadsides fired from Paris is not Sir Leon, but Jacques Delors, the French president of the commission. M Delors has pointed out that he is not in Brussels to serve French interests but those of
Europe.

This is proving a bad year for France in the EC. The realisation that time is running out for the common agricultural policy, which sustains many small French farmers, is slowly dawning. Also, Germany's powerful bankers have insisted on planning European monetary union on their own rigorous terms and flattened French objections.

EC Official  Defends Ruling On de Havilland  Takeover

STRASBOURG -- The European Community's top competition official lambasted French allegations of unfairness in the ECCommission's decision to block the  takeover of de Havilland.

Canada's commuter aircraft maker, a unit of Boeing Co. of the U.S., was being sought by  Aerospatiale of France and Italy's  Alenia SpA.

Speaking to the European Parliament, Sir Leon Brittan said, "It is quite absurd to make the suggestion that the merger regulation has been applied in any way that is unfair to France." The commission has approved many mergers involving French companies, he added.

He said the commission wouldn't bow to pressure from France and Italy to re-examine the case. The only way forward for the two companies is to challenge the decision before the European Court of Justice, he said.

Sir Leon criticized moves by French and Italian ministers to air the matter during meetings of EC transport and foreign ministers. He said political pressure shouldn't be applied in the council. "Once you allow that to happen it is always the interests of the small countries that lose out," he said.

The commission said it blocked the takeover because it would have created a dominant position in the turboprop commuter aircraft market. Sir Leon said claims that the European industry would suffer because of threats from foreign competition if the takeover were blocked were unfounded.

"The argument about the Americans and Japanese is completely irrelevant," he said. But small aircraft companies in the U.K., Spain, France and the Netherlands would be put at risk if the takeover went through, he said.

TORONTO -- An executive said in March that de  Havilland  business accounted for 40 per cent of the work at the
Fleet Industries factory in Fort Erie and 20 per cent of Fleet Aerospace's revenue.

Not only have de Havilland  sales slumped, but its long-anticipated  sale to a French-Italian consortium was blocked last week by the European Commission.

Fleet said in a news release that a new contract to supply components to the Bell Helicopter factory in Quebec will partly offset lost de Havilland business.
Improvement
Fleet lost $769,000 on continuing operations in the nine months ended June 30, an improvement from a loss of
$3.9 million on continuing operations a year earlier.
The company is searching for both new markets and an investor or partner to strengthen it financially.

Fleet has about 700 employees in Fort Erie. The company said it has cut employment of salaried workers by 31 per cent this year and hourly workers by 18 per cent.
An official would not discuss the actual numbers of employees laid off, or likely to be laid off, as a result of de
Havilland's latest plan to reduce production.

Aerospatiale lashes Brittan,  who says industry backs EC takeover veto

PARIS, Oct 10 (AFP) - French state-owned  Aerospatiale on Thursday pursued vigorous attacks on the  EC           commission for vetoeing a  takeover bid for Canadian De  Havilland,  while Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said most of the aerospace sector backed him.

Aerospatiale president Henri Martre, who has described the veto as a "stab in the back", denied suggestions that his group was not unhappy to be rid of the "De  Havilland  burden", stating that he would continue to argue for the takeover.

The size of the bid was well below that justifying investigation by the commission of the European Community (EC), and should have been "put aside without examination", Martre said condemning the commission's calculation of market share as "inexact".

Meanwhile, Brittan said in a newspaper interview here that the Franco-Italian bid for Canadian De Havilland, manufacturer of commuter aircraft, was vetoed by the EC because it would have created a dominant force in Europe.

The decision by the commission reflected "almost unanimous agreement of the views of the whole aerospace sector", he said.

The veto by the commission has drawn outspoken attacks on Brittan, Commission President Jacques Delors and on the Commission's anti-monopoly powers from French ministers, industrialists and parliamenterians.

Brittan told Le Monde that the European aircraft industry did not face an "external threat" sufficient to justify the takeover of De Havilland by French Aerospatiale and Italian Alenia.

"The Commission's determination to enable European industry to acquire its rightful role, in the front line of the world economy, is inseparable from its vision of a healthy competitive environment within its territory," Brittan said.

"The commission will continue to support industries which come together to face competition from outside when they are unable to attack alone," he said.
Noting that he backed the European Airbus aircraft manufacturing consortium "in view of intense competition from
Boeing and other rivals", he said that "the case of De Havilland is quite different".

There was "no external U.S. threat or any other, on the limited market for turbo-engined aircraft" and "in the medium term, the concentration would have seriously endangered existing employment".

EC Assembly Criticizes De Havilland  Decision

STRASBOURG, France (AP) - The  European Parliament on Thursday criticized the  EC Commission for vetoing a French-Italian plan to  buy Canadian aircraft maker De  Havilland.

A resolution charged the  Commission considered only the "narrow" question of whether the  takeover would create a dominant position on the world market.

It called for revising European Community competition law to force the Commission to consider jobs and the well-being of EC industry when reviewing such transactions.
But the 518-seat EC assembly did not demand that the Commission reopen the case.
The Commission ruled last week that the takeover of De Havilland, a Boeing Co. subsidiary, by Avions de
Transport Regional would have created an "unassailable" position on world markets.

Avions de Transport Regional is a joint venture of Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia SpA. It is the world's biggest manufacturer of commuter aircraft and De Havilland is the second-largest.
EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said Tuesday that the purchase would have given ATR-De
Havilland a 50 percent share of the world market for commuter aircraft and 64 percent share of the EC market.
The parliament said the Commission focused on "technical aspects" at the expense of "the political aspect of the
Community's general interest."
"The present regulation takes insufficient account of this wider range of factors," the resolution said. Document asp0000020011109dnaa00yym

STRASBOURG, France -AP- The  European Parliament today criticized the European Community Commission's veto of a French-Italian plan to  buy Canadian aircraft maker De Havilland  but stopped short of demanding a reconsideration.

In a resolution adopted by a large majority in a hand vote, the parliament charged the  Commission considered only the ''narrow'' question of whether the  takeover would create a dominant position on the world market.
It called for a revision of EC competition law to force the Commission to consider global competitiveness of EC
industry and EC jobs when reviewing such transactions.

But the 518-seat EC assembly rejected a proposal by some members to demand that the Commission reopen its review of the case.

Aviones de Transport is the world's biggest manufacturer of commuter aircraft and De Havilland is the second largest. De Havilland is a Canadian subsidiary of Boeing Co.

The deal was the first blocked by the European Community Commission under a year-old law giving it the right to approve all major mergers and acquisitions involving companies in the 12-nation trading bloc.

The European Parliament said the differences between the De Havilland deal and takeovers the Commission has approved were ''not sufficiently transparent.''

It said the Commission, in its review of the case, focused on ''technical aspects'' at the expense of ''the political aspect of the Community's general interest.''

AEROSPATIALE AND COMMISSION CLASH AGAIN ON DEHAVILLAND.
By Brian Love

BRUSSELS, Oct 10, Reuter - France's  Aerospatiale exchanged fresh blows with the European Commission on Thursday over an EC decision to stop the aerospace giant and Italian partner Alenia buying  Canadian aircraft manufacturer De Havilland.

Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said in France a political outcry against the veto was "ridiculous",  Aerospatiale accused the Commission of overstepping the mark and the  Commission called the firm's attacks totally unfounded.

The European Parliament voted on a motion criticising Brittan for failing to take the EC's industrial prowess into account when blocking the buyout on the grounds that it would kill competition in the EC and world commuter aircraft industry.
The first-ever decision by the Commission to block a buyout has caused a political outcry in France and a string
of attacks on Brussels, but Aerospatiale's statement was the first attempt to counter the technical reasoning of the
EC veto.

"From an industrial and commercial standpoint this matter is largely below the sales and turnover levels that characterise the "community dimension' which would justify the Commission's attention," the statement said.

"In an objective analysis...of the aerospace markets how can one fail to take into account Soviet and Japanese ambitions," it said, adding that future competition from manufacturers in East Europe and the Far East was also likely.

Brittan's spokesman in Brussels immediately countered the two charges. "It's clearly over the thresholds" and within the Commission's brief to decide, he said.

As far as emerging rivals were concerned, the spokesman accused Aerospatiale of double standards, saying the company itself had told the Commission months ago there was no risk of competition from eastern Europe in the commuter plane business.
"To allow a dominant position go ahead on the basis that there might one day be competition from eastern
Europe is unacceptable speculation," he added.

Earlier, Brittan had dismissed as "a ridiculous approach" accusations that the Commission's decision was undemocratic. His proposal to veto the purchase had won support of a bare majority within the 17-member Commission.

"The governments of the 12 (EC members) have had time to prepare themselves and it was under a French presidency of the European Council that they gave their power to the Commission to rule on industrial accords," he said.

The EC merger regulation was adopted in December 1989 and took effect in September 1990. Its main objective is that reviews of mergers should be "competition driven".

It gives the Commission the right to review and, if necessary, block mergers between firms whose combined worldwide turnover exceeds five billion Ecus and where the firms each generate over 250 million Ecus in sales within the Community.

The Commission spokesman said there was no question that the firms fell below these thresholds in the De
Havilland case.

He also flatly rejected Aerospatiale's third claim -- that "the truth is that the Alenia and Aerospatiale consortium, with De Havilland, could have hoped in the future to hold about 25 per cent of the world market."

He said the Commission had drawn up a 400-page analysis of the deal's potential impact in the market and concluded that in the crucial range -- 50 seat turbo-prop planes -- the group would have had 74 per cent of the EC market and 63 per cent of the world market.
Alternative conclusions drawn by Brittan's opponents within the Commission, principally Commissioners Martin
Bangemann and Karel Van Miert, were unreasonable, he said.
They included 19-seater planes and jets of up to 110 seats, which were not used by airlines to substitute 20 to
70-seater aircraft.

FRANCE'S DE HAVILLAND RESPONSE OVERDONE -PAPERS.

PARIS, Oct 10, Reuter - European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said charges the Commission was undemocratic in vetoing the purchase  of Boeing Co's de  Havilland  unit by Aerospatiale and Alenia SpA were ridiculous.
Brittan's remarks were quoted in French newspaper reports.
He also told the Paris daily Liberation that the French reaction to the decision was exaggerated. "It is a ridiculous approach," he said of charges the veto lacked democratic legitimacy.
Brittan and Commission President Jacques Delors have been the butt of harsh French criticism of the veto.

Asked how he viewed the French reaction, Brittan said: "Exaggerated. We are not dictators. This was not the decision of a single commissioner but of the whole Commission, which voted."

In the Paris daily Le Monde, Brittan sought to defend himself, saying the veto was justified given the absence of competition in the world regional aircraft market.

A Special Background Report On European Community Business and Politics

FALLOUT FROM the de  Havilland  affair could weaken  commission's clout.

Though last week's decision to block the acquisition of de Havilland  by Aerospatiale and Alenia was widely seen as a confirmation of the commission's competition powers, it also reopened old wounds. The decision -- over which individual commissioners remain divided -- has prompted angry criticism in France and Italy that the commission is applying competition law too strictly, while damaging the prospects of key, leading-edge industries. The dispute has reignited an acrimonious debate over whether or not  EC merger regulation should be used as an instrument of industrial policy to help such "strategic" industries as aeronautics or electronics.

The fresh controversy could hamper the commission's competition department in future battles. Competition experts say decisions over mergers and acquisitions are likely to become even more enmeshed in politics, rather than legal criteria. "The commission's enforcement policy might run into trouble in future cases," frets a senior official at Germany's Federal Cartel Office, which has strongly supported the commission's de Havilland decision. "The circumstances after the decision have made us really unhappy."

Calls are growing in both Germany and France for a system in which the commission could be overruled by national politicians, though such a change could take years.

THE LURE OF PARIS: Pascal Lamy, Delors's chief aide, is seeking the top post at the French Treasury. Officials say he has Delors's support for the move, which could occur in mid-1992. Lamy, who is respected as one of the commission's most powerful bureacrats, has been in the job since 1985. Says a Delors aide: "It's normal that he wants a job in France." But French Finance Minister Beregovoy recently denied he plans to replace the current directeur du Tresor, Jean-Claude Trichet. The rumors about Lamy succeeding Trichet "reflect personal ambitions and nothing else," according to one senior Treasury aide. Delors's own term expires at the end of next year, and he is widely expected to seek his political fortunes in France.

G-7 POWER: Belgium accuses the four European countries that are in the group of seven industrialized nations
of railroading other, smaller, EC states into this week's decision to provide the Soviet Union with 1.25 billion ECUs
in food aid. Belgian Finance Minister Maystadt, while not opposing the aid itself, criticizes the way it was rushed
through a morning session of a daylong meeting of EC finance ministers. The event has heightened worries
among small community member states that growing cooperation among Germany, France, Italy and Britain is
leaving these countries on the sidelines.

DEBT WRITE-OFF for Third World countries encounters opposition.

Britain, Germany and the Netherlands turn down commission proposals to forgive about three billion ECUs in debt owed to the EC by a group of 69 impoverished countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. Bonn and London oppose blanket debt forgiveness; they say debt should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, to be weighed according to human rights, economic reform and other criteria. But France supports the move -- which


Page 36 of 74 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
would cover only a small portion of the estimated 130 billion ECUs in debt -- as a sign that the EC isn't turning its back on the Third World while it plows money into Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
The commission will try to work out a compromise. But it may abandon the idea if opposition remains strong.
---

IMAGE PROBLEM: The European Parliament appears likely to back the commission's plans for high-definition television, which broadcasters say will ruin the satellite-TV business. French Socialist Gerard Caudron, whom the parliament has chosen to report on the plan, is supporting the commission's move to impose a new broadcasting standard throughout the EC. Abandoning the plan, as many in the broadcasting industry are urging the EC to do, would leave the door wide open to Japanese and U.S. competitors, Caudron asserts, threatening "the technological, strategic and cultural independence of Europe." The parliament is scheduled today to discuss the Caudron report.

TAX GAP: European heavy industry has found an ally in EC Tax Commissioner Scrivener. At a recent meeting of EC finance ministers, she tells them not to believe the commission's assurances that its proposed $10-a-barrel energy tax would be "fiscally neutral." Scrivener says the proposed tax is unlikely to be matched by promised tax cuts in other areas. EC environment ministers have backed the proposal, but skeptical finance ministers could block it.

STRASBOURG -- The  commission, the executive arm of the  EC, must work out procedures enabling its members responsible for industrial and competition policies to "work out jointly their proposals on  mergers that have significant importance for industrial policy," the resolution said.

Decisions on mergers must take account of "the impact of the  merger on Europe's industrial potential and the social, regional and environmental consequences. Relevant factors were the preservation of loyal competition and the need to strengthen the position of  European (economic) actors on the world market."
Examination
The French state-owned Aerospatiale has attacked the EC Commission for vetoing its bid for de Havilland. Company president Henri Martre contended the size of the bid was well below that justifying investigation by the
commission.

The case should have been put aside without examination, Mr. Martre said, condemning the commission's calculation of market share as inexact.

In a statement, the company dismissed the criteria adopted by the commission as artificial and arbitrary. The commissioners examined the catalogue of aircraft in "very narrow tranches rather than examining the whole range of 20-to 70- seater aircraft."
By taking over de Havilland, the consortium could hope to gain 25 per cent of the market, and the figures of 70 to
80 per cent announced are pure fantasy, the statement said.

Announcing its decision, the commission said the takeover would have enabled the consortium to gain 50 per cent of the world market and 67 per cent of the European market for turbo-engined regional transporters.

Mr. Martre earlier described the commission veto as a "stab in the back" and said he would continue to argue for the takeover.

Euro-deputies urge change of takeover rules

STRASBOURG, Oct 11 (AFP) - The European Parliament called on the European Commission Thursday to amend its rules on mergers in the light of an EC veto on a takeover bid for Canadian De Havilland,  and urged Community member states to adopt the new rules immediately.

The deputies acknowledged the legitimacy of the  Commission veto on the bid by the Franco-Italian consortium Aerospatiale-Alenia, but said the present rules took no account of factors such as the competitiveness of industry within the European Community.

The Commission has to work out procedures enabling its members responsible for industrial and competition policies to "work out jointly their proposals on mergers that have significant importance for industrial policy", the resolution said.

Decisions on mergers had to take account of "the impact of the merger on Europe's industrial potential and the social, regional and environmental consequences."

Aerospatiale Head Blasts  EC For Blocking De Havilland  Pact
484 words
11 October 1991
Dow Jones News Service
DJ

PARIS -DJ- Henri Martre, chairman of French aviation group Aerospatiale SNI, issued an angry retort to the European Community's rejection of its planned  takeover with Alenia SpA of Boeing Co.'s Canadian commuter aircraft manufacturing division, de  Havilland.

In a communique, Martre blasted the market analysis of the  EC Commission's ''bureaucrats,'' saying its criteria were ''artificial and arbitrary.'' The analysis ''corresponds in no way to the realities that are well known to air transportation and construction industry professionals,'' he declared. The  EC used too narrow a definition of the category of plane affected by the decision, he contended.

The communique is the latest volley in a war of words between the EC, the companies and French politicians, stirred by the heightened powers of the EC Commission to reject or approve mergers on the basis of their potential threat to competition.

Martre's tirade also follows an article by EC competition commissioner Sir Leon Brittan in today's Le Monde that argues that countries must put European interests above ''narrower national interests'' and that the nine out of 11 states supported the decision.

The EC said that the proposed merger would give the the two companies unchallenged market dominance in the commuter plane market.

Alenia and Aerospatiale's existing partnership, GIE Avions de Transport Regional, already makes them the world's biggest producer of commuter planes with less than 70 seats.

Without competition, Brittan and his Merger Task Force fear, Alenia, Aerospatiale and de Havilland could charge its small airline-company customers whatever prices it liked for new planes.

But Aerospatiale's Martre said that the proposed takeover didn't even merit EC attention because revenues and sales were ''well below'' the EC-wide size that would justify Brussels' intervention, adding that the U.S. Department of Commerce said it didn't need to examine the deal and Canada's Competition Bureau approved it.

Martre also indicated that the group wasn't without competitors, as Brittan stated in Le Monde, saying it was well known that competing Eastern European and Japanese airplanes would soon be on the market.

Estimates that Alenia and Aerospatiale would have 70-80 pc of the world market are ''fantastical and bear no relation to the realities of the world,'' Martre contended. ''The truth is that the consortium Alenia and Aerospatiale, can hope in the future to hold, with de Havilland, 25 pc of the world market.''

Martre also protested that the two commissioners of the EC Commission who handle transportation and industrial policy were in favor of the move. ''It's disturbing to see that in such a technical debate, the opinion of those who are really competent wasn't followed.''

An Aerospatiale spokeswoman said that the companies have the option of appealing the decision but that they haven't decided whether to do so yet.

It called for a revision of EC competition law to force the commission to consider global competitiveness of EC

But the 518-seat EC assembly rejected a proposal by some members to demand the commission reopen its review of the case.

Several French and Italian cabinet ministers have demanded reconsideration since the commission announced its decision last week.

In his first public statement since resigning last May, Michel Rocard, former French prime minister, condemned the veto as ''a crime against Europe.''
The commission ruled the takeover of de Havilland by Avions de Transport Regional, a joint venture of
Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia SpA, would have created an ''unassailable'' position on world markets.

Avions de Transport is the world's biggest manufacturer of commuter aircraft and de Havilland is second largest. De Havilland is a subsidiary of Boeing Co.

The deal was the first blocked by the European Community Commission under a year-old law, giving it the right to approve major mergers and acquisitions involving companies in the 12-nation trading bloc.

Paris - Michel Rocard, the former French Prime Minister, launched a fierce attack on Sir Leon Brittan, the British member of the European Commission responsible for competition, over his handling of the Franco-Italian bid to buy De Havilland  Canada.

Mr Rocard, referring to the  Commission's rejection of the bid by  Aerospatiale of France and  Alenia of Italy, said Sir Leon had "strong, unshakable convictions and an astonishing ability to simplify and increase the stakes in any debate".

STRASBOURG, France, Oct 10, Reuter - The  European Parliament criticised the European Commission's decision last week to block the  takeover of Boeing Co's De  Havilland  unit by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia SpA of Italy.

Voting by a show of hands, members approved a motion deploring Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan's stance, but they stopped short of demanding reconsideration.
However, their motion did ask for revamping of EC competition policy in future to include input from other
European Commission members.

In an interview with Les Echos the European Commissioner for Transport, Karel Van Miert, gave a negative assessment of the decision by the European Commission to uphold Leon Brittan's veto of the proposed takeover of De Havilland  by Aerospatiale and Alenia. The decision failed to take market shares in regional jets into account, and was based purely on considerations of competition without due attention to industrial strategy. Lack of competition should not disqualify a company such as De Havilland  from penetrating a promising market. Questions of competition are essential to the work of the Commission, but France and Belgium are right in thinking that industrial strategy should also play a key role. Rules on industrial strategy should be inserted into the Commission's statutes when the new treaty is developed.

STRASBOURG, France - The  European Parliament has criticized the  EC Commission for vetoing a
French-Italian plan to  buy Canadian aircraft maker de  Havilland.

A resolution charged the  commission considered only the "narrow" question of whether the  takeover would create a dominant position on the world market.

It called for revising European Community competition law to force the commission to consider jobs and the well-being of EC industry when reviewing such transactions.
But the 518-seat EC assembly did not demand that the commission reopen the case.
The commission ruled last week that the takeover of de Havilland, a Boeing subsidiary, by Avions de Transport
Regional would have created an "unassailable" position on world markets.

Avions de Transport Regional is a joint venture of Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia SpA. It is the world's biggest manufacturer of commuter aircraft and de Havilland is the second-largest.
EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said Tuesday that the purchase would have given ATR-de
Havilland a 50 percent share of the world market for commuter aircraft and 64 percent share of the EC market.
The parliament said the commission focused on "technical aspects" at the expense of "the political aspect of the
Community's general interest."
"The present regulation takes insufficient account of this wider range of factors," the resolution said. Brittan has said the commission will not reconsider the deal unless new facts emerge.
And ATR has indicated it is not eager to make a lengthy appeal to the European Court of Justice.

EP CALLS FOR REVISION OF EC REGULATION ON PRIOR CONTROL OF MERGERS.
447 words
12 October 1991
Agence Europe
AGEU

(c) 1991 Agence EUROPE, Brussels Not Available for Re-dissemination. .
Plenary session of the  European Parliament.

STRASBOURG, 11/10/1991 (AGENCE EUROPE) - After the often emotional debate on the De  Havilland/ATR affair (see  EUROPE 10 October), the European Parliament finally adopted a fairly moderate resolution presented by the Socialists Roumeliotis (Greek), Desmond (British) and Van Hemeldonck (Belgian) which recognizes that
the Commission was held to statute on this affair on the basis of the  Merger Regulation of 21 December 1989, but which, at the same times, calls for the Regulation to be the subject of revision.

According to the EP, when making the decision on whether to authorize a merger, account will have to be taken of the possible impact of such a decision on the potential European industry and social, regional and environmental consequences, at the same time keeping in mind the need to preserve fair competition and strengthen the position of Europe at international level.

The EP also believes that, for mergers with great significance in terms of industrial policy, there should be a procedure enabling the member of the Commission responsible for industrial policy and the one responsible for competition to work out a common proposal. The EP also believes that since the coming into force of the 1989
Regulation, the reasons on which the Commission bases its decisions are not transparent enough. On the other hand, the EP rejected an amendment by Mr. Fuchs and other members of the Socialist group calling on the Commission, while waiting for the revision of the Regulation, to re-examine the De Havilland dossier on the basis of "an appropriate analysis of the segment of the market taken into account", as well as criteria of industrial policy.

The French Socialist Maria-Claude Vayssade, Vice-President of the Committee on Legal Affairs, while admitting that the Commission's decision could be "contested in substance", "disapproved of the use of the De Havilland affair to put the Commission's institutional powers into question (...) It is only exercising the powers it has in the treaties and derived texts (...) The Commission is not infallible, but it did not over- stretch its competencies, as it did not over-stretch them when it made favourable decisions at the request of other French industrialists (like Renault/Volvo)".

As for Karel von Wogau, German Christian-Democrat, while respecting the Commission's decision and considering that the EP should stick to its position in favour of merger controls, he renewed the proposal of the EPP group of transferring the work of the "task force" which prepares the decisions in these matters to an agency independent of the Commission.

EC blasted again over rejection of de Havilland  bid

Henri Martre, chairman of France's Aerospatiale SA, issued an angry retort Friday to the  European Community's rejection of its planned  takeover with Alenia SpA of de  Havilland.

In a communique, Martre blasted the market analysis of the ECCommission's ''bureaucrats,'' saying its criteria were ''artificial and arbitrary.'' The analysis ''corresponds in no way to the realities that are well known to air transportation and construction industry professionals,'' he declared.
The EC used too narrow a definition of the category of plane affected by the decision, he contended.

The communique is the latest volley in a war of words between the EC, the companies and French politicians, stirred by the heightened powers of the EC Commission to reject or approve mergers on the basis of their potential threat to competition.

Martre's tirade also follows an article by EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan in Friday's Le Monde that argues that countries must put European interests above ''narrower national interests'' and that the nine out of 11 states supported the decision.

The EC said that the proposed merger would give the the two companies unchallenged market dominance in the commuter plane market. Alenia and Aerospatiale's existing partnership, Avions de Transport Regional, already makes them the world's biggest producer of commuter planes with less than 70 seats. Without competition, Brittan and his merger task force fear Alenia, Aerospatiale and de Havilland could charge its small
airline-company customers whatever prices it liked for new planes.

But Aerospatiale's Martre said the proposed takeover didn't even merit EC attention because revenues and sales were ''well below'' the EC-wide size that would justify Brussels' intervention, adding the U.S. Department of Commerce said it didn't need to examine the deal and Canada's Competition Bureau was reviewing it.

Martre also indicated that the group wasn't without competitors, as Brittan stated in Le Monde, saying it was well known that competing Eastern European and Japanese airplanes would soon be in the market.

Estimates that Alenia and Aerospatiale would have 70% to 80% of the world market are ''fantastical and bear no relation to the realities of the world,'' Martre contended.

PARIS -- Henri Martre, chairman of French aviation group Aerospatiale SNI, issued an angry retort to the European Community's rejection of its planned takeover with Alenia S.p.A of Boeing Corp.'s Canadian commuter aircraft manufacturing division, de Havilland.

In a communique, Mr. Martre blasted the market analysis of the  EC Commission's "bureaucrats," saying its criteria were "artificial and arbitrary." The analysis "corresponds in no way to the realities that are well known to air transportation and construction industry professionals," he declared. The  EC used too narrow a definition of the category of plane affected by the decision, he contended.

The communique is the latest volley in a war of words between the EC, the companies and French politicians, stirred by the heightened powers of the EC Commission to reject or approve mergers on the basis of their potential threat to competition.

Estimates that Alenia and Aerospatiale would have 70%-80% of the world market are "fantastical and bear no relation to the realities of the world," Mr. Martre contended. "The truth is that the consortium Alenia and Aerospatiale can hope in the future to hold, with de Havilland, 25% of the world market."

Mr. Martre also protested that the two commissioners of the EC Commission who handle transportation and industrial policy were in favor of the move. "It's disturbing to see that in such a technical debate, the opinion of those who are really competent wasn't followed."

An Aerospatiale spokeswoman said that the companies have the option of appealing the decision but that they haven't decided whether to do so.

BRITTAN FACES COMMISSION REVOLT AFTER DE HAVILLAND CRISIS.
By Brian Love
540 words
14 October 1991
Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 1991 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, Oct 14, Reuter - Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan risks being stripped of his powers to manage big merger inquiries by colleagues furious at his stance in the run-up to vetoing a  European  buyout  of Canada's De Havilland.

Commission officials said on Monday a group led by Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann was rebelling against Brittan's control of such inquiries and planned to cut his delegated powers when they come up for renewal on October 23.

The move is the latest and most serious backlash to shake the 17-member Commission since it voted by a bare majority on October 2 to stop De Havilland's sale to France's Aerospatiale and Italian partner Alenia.

That veto drew a spate of attacks from French politicians as high up as Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and ex-Prime Minister Michel Rocard, who called it a "crime against Europe".

Bangemann, who has been opposing Brittan's power for some time, has sent a letter to all other Commissioners seeking to tighten the reins, said the officials, who asked not to be identified.

At stake is Brittan's right to take certain decisions alone during various stages of inquiries under the EC merger control regulation -- powers delegated to him for one year when the regulation took effect in September 1990.

Bangemann and others want to change the rules so that Brittan can no longer move from the prliminary 30-day inquiry to a second-stage probe without a decision taken collectively by the Commission.
Currently he has only to confer with Commission President Jacques Delors.
Brittan's opponents also want a say in the proposals sent for an opinion to the EC Advisory Committee on
Dominant Positions in the closing stages of the crucial phase-two inquiry.

Currently Brittan does not have to supply the Committee, which is made up of member state representatives, with documents or opinions from departments other than DGIV, the competition directorate.

If the revolt succeeds, many officials say, it would be a victory for Bangemann and those who think safeguarding free competition in European Community industry is sometimes a poor excuse for stopping firms allying to fight U.S. and Japanese rivals.

Brittan, seen as the champion of free market policy in the Commission, would no longer be able to launch a full inquiry into a merger without getting backing from his colleagues after the first-stage preliminary review.

This would prevent him from steering inquiries alone and leaving other Commissioners in the dark until late in the day when they have to take a decision based on arguments prepared over months by Brittan, some officials say.

But although the change would give other Commissioners a greater say in investigations, it could also jeopardise the Commission's credibility as a competition watchdog and hamper its ability to meet tight decision deadlines, they add.

If the Commission is split during an preliminary inquiry, it could have serious problems taking a crucial decision to clear a merger or launch a full probe within the one-month time limit.

AIRLINES OPPOSE EC DECISION TO REJECT DE HAVILLAND ACQUISITION

CEOs from Europe's largest airlines told the European Community last week that their ideological stance on acquisitions, such as the one between Alenia, Aerospatiale and Boeing de Havilland  aircraft unit, would damage their competitive positions. Representatives from Air France, Lufthansa, KLM, Swissair and Alitalia were involved in the "frank" discussions with  EC commissioners, according to a spokeswoman from the Association of European Airlines.

"They {EC commissioners} do not understand the real economics of airlines," the AEA spokeswoman said. AEA also reacted negatively to an EC plan to redistribute slots at some of  Europe's major airports, giving them to new entrant carriers. "The commission's plan means more bureaucracy and we will lose established rights," she said. The policies make it even more difficult for airlines to plan in advance and order appropriate aircraft.

Separately, AEA reported load factors averaging 72.7% for member carriers in August, up from 69.8% in July but down 2.1 points versus August 1990. July load factors were down 5.1 points compared to June 1990.

European Commissioners seek to limit Brittan's powers

AFPR
English
(Copyright 1991)
BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (AFP) - Several members of the EuropeanCommission want to limit the powers of Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan in the wake of the furore over the De Havillandtakeover, informed sources said here Tuesday.

The dissatisfied members of the 17-member  European Community executive want more members involved in enquiries into takeovers  and competition questions, to ensure that industrial policy aspects are also taken into account.

France and Italy have criticised the veto earlier this month of a Franco-Italian takeover of Canadian aircraft maker De Havilland on purely competition grounds, saying the Commission had not understood the importance of the move for the future of the European aeronautics industry.

Brittan has argued that the move would have given Aerospatiale and Alenia a dominant position in the European commuter aircraft market, and that France has over-reacted.

French officials and Aerospatiale have suggested that Brittan, a former British cabinet minister, was motivated by a desire to protect the other major European operators in the field, British Aerospace and Fokker of the Netherlands.

At the moment Brittan and Commission president Jacques Delors of France are the only people involved in deciding whether to open an enquiry into deals which could threaten free competition in the EC.

The final decision is then taken by the Commission as a whole, but in the case of the De Havilland takeover the veto went through on a majority of just one vote.
The current system is to be questioned at a Commission meeting on October 23 in Strasbourg. more/ AFP AFP SEQN-0292

EC Aide Proposes  Shift in Reviews Of Merger Bids
By Martin du Bois
Staff Reporter
554 words
15 October 1991
The Asian Wall Street Journal
AWSJ
PAGE 8

BRUSSELS -- Martin Bangemann, the European Community's commissioner for industrial affairs, proposed major changes in the way the EC Commission reviews mergers and acquisitions.

The proposal adds to a growing controversy over the commission's powers to block business deals, following its controversial veto of the  purchase  of de Havilland  by Aerospatiale SA and  Alenia SpA. The move could significantly clip the wings of Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.

Under the present system, Sir Leon is in sole charge of investigating potentially anti-competitive business combinations. Under Mr. Bangemann's proposal, other commissioners could get involved as well, to ensure that EC industrial-policy goals didn't get short shrift. One official close to Sir Leon criticized Mr. Bangemann's proposal, saying it would make the EC's merger-review system "unworkable."
Mr. Bangemann made his proposal in letters to Commission President Jacques Delors and other EC officials. The
17-member commission is expected to discuss whether to review Sir Leon's powers later this month.

It's still unclear how much support Mr. Bangemann will get. But Sir Leon alienated many of his colleagues after he succeeded in winning a commission order blocking Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy from buying de Havilland, a Canadian maker of commuter aircraft and a division of Boeing Co.

That decision -- the first time the commission has vetoed a deal under the one-year-old EC merger control regulation -- was strongly criticized by the French and Italian governments. The ruling had also been opposed by some key EC commissioners including Mr. Bangemann.

These critics contended that the decision was based on narrow legal criteria and ignored the need for a strong European presence in the global aircraft market. Sir Leon secured the Oct. 2 ruling with only a one-vote majority in the commission.

Sir Leon argued that the acquisition of de Havilland would have given the purchasers an unacceptably high share of the market for turboprop commuter aircraft. This would have threatened competing manufacturers like British Aerospace PLC, Fokker NV and Saab-Scania AB, he said.

Under Mr. Bangemann's proposal, Sir Leon could no longer decide on his own to launch an investigation into a particular merger, acquisition or joint venture. If the inquiry affected the agenda of other commissioners, they too would get a say. During the investigation, Sir Leon also would have to consult with his colleagues.

For example, if the business combination were to involve airlines, Sir Leon would need to work in tandem with Karel Van Miert, the commissioner in charge of transport policy. Or if a computer or telecommunications company were involved, Commissioner Filippo Maria Pandolfi could step in. Of course, Mr. Bangemann himself, who's in charge of overall EC industrial policy, could argue he needs to be consulted on most inquiries, EC officials said.
Sir Leon's aides worry that the review process would get too complex and open to lobbying.

Several EC officials said Mr. Delors is unlikely to support a measure that would be interpreted as a lack of trust in Sir Leon. Mr. Delors has defended the commission's de Havilland ruling, spurning violent criticism from fellow French politicians who accused him of betraying their national interests.

Sir Leon BRITTAN'S powers OVER COMPETITION POLICY under pressure.
By Andrew Marshall, West Europe Editor.

Sir Leon Brittan is to face pressure from fellow  European Commissioners to relinquish some of his wide powers over takeovers.

The move follows a  European  Commission decision to block a takeover of de Havilland,  the Canadian aircraft manufacturer, by ATR, a Franco-Italian consortium. The decision set advocates of a market-driven competition policy, such as Sir Leon, against those in favour of allowing industrial policy to play a larger role.

Under existing year-old rules, Sir Leon, the competition commissioner, and his officials have sole authority to vet mergers over ecu5bn (#3.5bn). However, several commissioners are proposing that the whole commission should be more involved. This would allow each commissioner to state his views on a case at any stage of the competition procedure, though Sir Leon's directorate would retain considerable discretionary power. Several
commissioners, including Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, will push for the reformulation when the
Commission meets in two weeks' time to review merger policy.

Officials in Sir Leon's directorate said that decentralising competition policy would drag out the process, making it much more unwieldy. "It's hard enough to push through a merger in less than five months already," said an official. "This would make it impossible."

However, proponents of the revised plan argue that the present framework allows the competition commission to work in too much of a vacuum, and that it produces shocks to the system when a decision taken by Sir Leon is overturned.

There are also moves to lower the thresholds for competition decision-making, bringing more mergers within the EC ambit, though officials in Sir Leon's office say that no such proposals are on the table. Nonetheless, this move has raised the ire of British business, which fears that Brussels politics will intrude into British bids and deals.

The competition commission had hoped the de Havilland decision would raise the credibility of EC policy, but it seems to have succeeded in stirring up a hornet's nest. French politicians have used the issue to attack Jacques Delors, the Commission President, while Sir Leon was last week lambasted by European parliamentarians.

European  Merger Activity: EC Official  Seeks Shift in Handling  Merger Attempts

BRUSSELS -- Martin Bangemann, the European Community's commissioner for industrial affairs, proposed major changes in the way the EC Commission reviews mergers and acquisitions.

The proposal adds to a growing controversy over the commission's powers to block business deals, following its controversial veto of the  purchase  of de Havilland  by Aerospatiale SA and  Alenia SpA. The move could significantly clip the wings of Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.

Under the present system, Sir Leon is in sole charge of investigating potentially anti-competitive business combinations. Under Mr. Bangemann's proposal, other commissioners could get involved as well, to ensure that EC industrial-policy goals didn't get short shrift. One official close to Sir Leon criticized Mr. Bangemann's proposal, saying it would make the EC's merger-review system "unworkable."
Mr. Bangemann made his proposal in letters to Commission President Jacques Delors and other EC officials. The
17-member commission is expected to discuss whether to review Sir Leon's powers later this month.

It's still unclear how much support Mr. Bangemann will get. But Sir Leon alienated many of his colleagues after he succeeded in winning a commission order blocking Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy from buying de Havilland, a Canadian maker of commuter aircraft and a division of Boeing Co.

That decision -- the first time the commission has vetoed a deal under the one-year-old EC merger control regulation -- was strongly criticized by the French and Italian governments. The ruling had also been opposed by some key EC commissioners including Mr. Bangemann.

These critics contended that the decision was based on narrow legal criteria and ignored the need for a strong European presence in the global aircraft market. Sir Leon secured the Oct. 2 ruling with only a one-vote majority in the commission.

Sir Leon argued that the acquisition of de Havilland would have given the purchasers an unacceptably high share of the market for turboprop commuter aircraft. This would have threatened competing manufacturers like British Aerospace PLC, Fokker NV and Saab-Scania AB, he said.

Under Mr. Bangemann's proposal, Sir Leon could no longer decide on his own to launch an investigation into a particular merger, acquisition or joint venture. If the inquiry affected the agenda of other commissioners, they too would get a say. During the investigation, Sir Leon also would have to consult with his colleagues.

For example, if the business combination were to involve airlines, Sir Leon would need to work in tandem with Karel Van Miert, the commissioner in charge of transport policy. Or if a computer or telecommunications company were involved, Commissioner Filippo Maria Pandolfi could step in. Of course, Mr. Bangemann himself, who's in charge of overall EC industrial policy, could argue he needs to be consulted on most inquiries, EC officials said.
Sir Leon's aides worry that the review process would get too complex and open to lobbying.

Several EC officials said Mr. Delors is unlikely to support a measure that would be interpreted as a lack of trust in Sir Leon. Mr. Delors has defended the commission's de Havilland ruling, spurning violent criticism from fellow French politicians who accused him of betraying their national interests.

BRUSSELS -- Jacques Delors, president of the  European Community Commission, will meet the chairman of France's  Aerospatiale, Henri Martre, next Monday. They will discuss the de Havilland  affair, the dispute with the U.S. over the alleged subsidies paid to Airbus Industrie, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the commission said. The meeting was scheduled well before the  commission's recent veto of an  acquisition of Canada's de Havilland  by Aerospatiale and Alenia SpA of Italy. The veto aroused a storm of criticism in France and Italy. The commission said it took the decision to protect competition. The announcement said Mr. Delors meets business leaders regularly to study "how to make  European industry competitive."

FRANCE, ITALY DRAWING UP NEW DE HAVILLAND PLAN.

VITERBO, Italy, Oct 18, Reuter - France and Italy are confident they can redraft a proposed Franco-Italian buyout  of Canadian aircraft manufacturer De  Havilland  so as to overcome EC Commission objections to the deal, French European Affairs Minister Elizabeth Guigou said.

The Commission earlier this month blocked the proposed takeover of Boeing Co's loss-making unit by Italy's Alenia SpA and France's Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale on the grounds that the partnership would dominate the  European market for commuter planes.

"We are at present working on new ways of proposing this deal so that it will be satisfactory both to the Commission and to our industrialists," Guigou, who was attending the annual Franco-Italian summit here, told Reuters.
She said she was fairly optimistic a re-packaged deal would win approval from the Commission, the European
Community's executive, which rejected the proposed deal on October 2 in a split vote.

"If there is a bit of good will, I think we should be able to make it," Guigou said. She gave no details of how the deal was being re-worked.
France and Italy's opposition to the Commission decision was earlier reiterated by Italian Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti.

"We don't at all believe it conflicts with EC competition rules. On the contrary, it strengthens European cooperation to enable us to compete better with non-EC manufacturers," Andreotti told a news conference.
He was speaking after two days of talks with French President Francois Mitterrand. Document lba0000020011124dnai068aa

Martre told reporters that "The contract that we signed with Boeing (owner of De Havilland),  a sale contract, is now void due to the  European  Commission's decision. There is no further acquisition project.

"The problem is now a Canadian problem. It concerns the federal government and the Ontario government. They are thinking about the problem. But a company like ours cannot be indifferent to all this. We are available for any kind of cooperation".

He said that "The initiative is Canadian, and the arrangements made to solve the problem will be Canadian. We are not called on to intervene".

Martre added that the case "is not of community dimensions", and should not have been handled at community level.

Aerospatiale chairman Henri Martre said  Aerospatiale and its Italian partner  Alenia, which had wanted to
acquire de Havilland  together, are still prepared to co-operate in the matter.

He was speaking to reporters after meeting with Jacques Delors, president of the  European Community Commission, which vetoed on Oct. 2 the proposed  acquisition on the grounds that it would reduce competition in the commuter aircraft industry.
The veto aroused widespread anger in France.

French press reports have suggested that Aerospatiale and Alenia might take a minority holding in de Havilland and that the Montreal-based Bombardier firm would be a third shareholder.

Regarding the possibility of Bombardier's participation, an industrial source said Aerospatiale and Bombardier had held talks during the summer but had been unable to agree.
Via rolling

MONTREAL -- Via Rail Canada has reported Monday year-to-date figures showing improvements in both ridership and operating performance.

Between January and September, the number of passengers increased 6 per cent to 2.72 million, from 2.57 million last year.
Passenger revenue increased 8 per cent to $107.2 million, up from $99.3 million during the same period last year. Via also said in a statement yesterday that its trains were on time 90 per cent of the time, a 3-per-cent
improvement from last year.
Heady award

SASKATOON -- Great Western Brewing Company, an employee-owned brewery in Saskatoon, has taken top honors at the annual ABEX Awards.

The company was formed less than two years ago by a group of employees who had been thrown out of work when Carling O'Keefe and Molson merged, rendering Molson's Saskatoon brewery redundant.

Sixteen workers invested their severance pay in the plant, which now produces beer that is being sold in three provinces and several American states.
Great Western was the only double winner of the awards for business excellence sponsored by the
Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce. It also claimed top prize in the new venture category.
OSC Blackout
TORONTO -- The Ontario Securities Commission has issued a permanent cease-trading order against Twilight
Industries, a company that promised a $100,000 return on a $10,000 investment.

Page 63 of 74 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A panel of three commissioners ruled yesterday that the Toronto-based company may not make use of an exemption in the Ontario Securities Act to sell its product.
For a $10,000 investment, Twilight either produced a return of $100,000 or a letter saying the investor lost
$100,000 that could be used for tax purposes, Twilight lawyer Ron Chapman said.
The commission issued a temporary cease-trading order against Twilight in December 1990.

A hearing in January had been adjourned until yesterday while Twilight received information from Revenue Canada about the status of its investment, which in theory involved multimillion-dollar transactions between two European banks.

Owner Paul Butt testified none of the transactions ever closed, but Twilight had issued letters investors used to reduce their tax payable.
Investors had placed about $100,000 with the company in 1989 and 1990. Cognos falls
TORONTO -- The shares of an Ottawa-based software company took a dip yesterday after the company's chairman said third-quarter revenue would be less than expected.

Shares in Cognos Inc. fell $3.25 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, closing at $16.25, after an industry group was told revenue will grow only 10 to 12 per cent, instead of 15 to 20 per cent.

Cognos, the largest and most mature independent software company in Canada, has been a shining star in the technology sector lately.

It has trimmed management costs over the last two years, doubled its six-month profit and is expanding its product line.
The company was beginning to enjoy a nice runup in its stock price in recent months.

Shares were in such hot demand in the United States that it offered 1.5 million new shares for sale to international investors this spring, as well as 563,000 shares that were put up by existing shareholders.

The stock analysts had expected second-quarter profit of 14 to 18 cents a share. Cognos came in at 18 cents, but its revenue growth was only 15 per cent.

An alternative solution for the De  Havilland  affair?

BRUSSELS, 21/10/1991 (AGENCE  EUROPE) - Last Friday, the President of the French firm for aeronautical construction  Aerospatiale, Mr. Martre, met Mrs. Scrivener, European commissioner charged with taxation, and on Monday, Mr. Delors, President of the European Commission. A spokesman pointed out that Mr. Martre had not asked for a meeting with Sir Leon Brittan, Vice-President of the Commission in charge of competition who had suggested that the Commission should not authorise the purchase  of the Canadian firm De  Havilland (belonging to Boeing) by Aerospatiale and by the Italian maker Alenia.

Discussions bore upon the situation and the prospects of the European aeronautics industry. The spokesman pointed out that Mrs. Scrivener confirmed to Mr. Martre the importance that she attaches to the development of industrial cooperation between European firms in high technology sectors such as aeronautics and the importance of the links between European and North American firms in this context. De Havilland being a North American company (Canada and United States), it is easy to understand that the specific case of this firm has been discussed. The Commission's negative decision is final as regards operation as it had been envisaged. Other formulas, however, are possible and the Commission will examine them (on condition that they do not simply constitute a modification in the external appearance of the prohibited operation).

On the fringe of the French/Italian Summit in Viterbo, Mrs. Guigou, French Minister for European Affairs, indicated that other formulas are currently being examined. It could be question of a broader alliance (also involving the Dutch firm Fokker and a second Canadian firm Bombardier), either as regards a minority stake to be held by Aerospatiale and Alenia in De Havilland, without control (which would eliminate the grievance of dominant position). There are, however, still other possibilities.

France and Italy are to make counter-proposals to  buy the Canadian company De  Havilland  after the  European Commission's veto, said Mrs. Elisabeth Guigou, Minister for  European Affairs, at a Mitterrand-Andreotti Summit in Viterbe.

The new project by Aerospatiale and Alenia aims at acquiring a minority share in De  Havilland,  making void the European Commission's objection of dominant position. But the question remains of who will hold the majority.
Among the hypotheses put forward, the Government of Ontario has been mentioned and the Canadian group
Bombardier. The latter is said to have made contact with the Dutch firm Fokker to work out a takeover bid.

Aerospatiale and Alenia have accepted the EC Commission's judgment on their proposed  takeover of De Havilland  of Canada, and the case is now closed. Aerospatiale chairman Henry Martre says they no longer have any acquisition plans, although the two partners remain disposed to collaborate; it is now up to the Canadian government to find a solution.  Alenia chairman Fausto Cereti is convinced that De  Havilland  will still need to collaborate with  European aircraft manufacturers.

However, M Martre feels that the  EC needs to bear in mind that the aeronautical industry suffers from other problems as it considers its policy for the industry.
The close links between industrial policy and competition are being discussed today at the EC Commission. [Original article approx 300 words]

BRITTAN BEATS OFF CHALLENGE OVER EC MERGER PROBES.
By Simon Alterman

(c) 1991 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, Oct 25, Reuter -  EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan has beaten off a challenge to his powers to run investigations into large-scale  European Community mergers, Commission sources said on Friday.

The challenge was mounted amid controversy over the European Commission's decision this month to block a takeover by Italy's Alenia SpA and France's Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale of Boeing Co's Canadian division de Havilland.

Brittan, backed by a majority of the 17-member EC executive, argued the proposed takeover would effectively end competition in one sector of the aircraft manufacturing industry.

France and Italy complained that rigid application of competition rules was preventing European companies from mounting an effective challenge in global markets.

EC Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann, who had supported the Franco-Italian case, then wrote to his Commission colleagues suggesting that they should not renew Brittan's powers to order a full merger inquiry by himself. That decision should rest with the full Commission, Bangemann said.

The sources said that at the suggestion of Commission President Jacques Delors, Bangemann and Brittan had now agreed that his powers should be renewed for a further three months.

Under merger control rules introduced a year ago, the Commission has the power to vet all big mergers affecting the EC market.
After being notified of such a deal, the executive has one month to decide whether to order a full inquiry or to
allow it to go ahead. For the sake of efficiency, the Commission has delegated the power to make that decision to
Brittan.

Bangemann has long been concerned that other commissioners are not sufficiently involved in merger cases. One source said he had agreed to the three-month extension because he wanted to make clear that his concern was not solely the result of the de Havilland case -- the first merger blocked by the Commission.

But another source said Bangemann had backed down because he had mustered virtually no support for the initiative amongst his colleagues.

Other commissioners enjoy similar delegated powers in their areas of responsibility. The sources said many would be reluctant to leave themselves open to having their powers challenged by taking away some of Brittan's perogatives.

Brittan also argued that it would be impractical for the full Commission to be involved at every stage of the process since it could mean four separate decisions within five months.

BRUSSELS, Oct 25, Reuter - Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan has beaten off a challenge to his powers to run investigations into large-scale  European Community mergers, Commission sources said on Friday.

The challenge was mounted amid controversy over the Commission's decision this month to block a  takeover by Italy's Alenia SpA and France's Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale of Boeing Co's Canadian division de Havilland.

Brittan argued successfully that the proposed takeover would effectively end competition in one sector of the aircraft manufacturing industry.

But another source said Bangemann had backed down because he had mustered virtually no support for the initiative amongst his colleagues. Only Italy's Carlo Ripa di Meana had backed him fully. France's Christiane Scrivener had initially leaned to Bangemann but had accepted Brittan's offer of more information.

Other commissioners enjoy similar delegated powers in their areas of responsibility. The sources said many would be reluctant to leave themselves open to having their powers challenged by taking away some of Brittan's prerogatives.

Brittan also argued that it would be impractical for the full Commission to be involved at every stage of the process since it could mean four separate decisions within five months.

Sources close to Bangemann said he still wanted to have a full debate about the conduct of merger control investigations but preferred to do so when the heat from the de Havilland affair had died down.

ALENIA COOL ON MINORITY DE HAVILLAND STAKE FOR ATR CONSORTIUM.
By Giselda Vagnoni
355 words
25 October 1991
Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 1991 Reuters Limited
TOULOUSE, France, Reuter -  Alenia SpA, half the Franco- Italian ATR consortium stymied in a bid to  acquire de
Havilland  of Canada, said on Friday ATR might consider a minority stake in the Toronto aircraft maker if the
terms were right.

The bid by Alenia and its ATR partner Ste Nationale Industrielle  Aerospatiale to buy Boeing Co's loss-making Canadian division was blocked on October 2 by the European Community's executive  Commission on the grounds it would have given the ATR too big a share of the EC market.

"The hypothesis of a minority stake does not seem very attractive to us, but it would depend on the conditions," Alenia president Fausto Cereti said.

The prime condition would be a solid agreement on marketing policy for future ATR output, including its plans for a new 100-seater commuter plane, Cereti told reporters at a ceremony to mark the opening of a school for aerospace marketing here.
"The thing which interests us is a common commercial policy for our future production," he said.

Cereti reaffirmed Alenia and Aerospatiale had no plans to put a new proposal to the EC Commission, saying it was up to the EC and the Canadian government to decide on any new initiatives.

Last week, French European Affairs Minister Elizabeth Guigou said France and Italy were working on a new draft of the proposed buyout which they hoped would overcome EC objections.

Cereti said ATR would have no problem with any accord which involved the Ontario provincial government's taking an equity stake in de Havilland.

"We would have no problem in forming a partnership with the Canadian authorities, the presence of the state in strategic sectors (of the economy) is normal," Cereti said.
He said the consortium had no alternative plans for taking over another commuter planemaker in place of de
Havilland.
"We have not considered the possibility of buying any other company," Cereti said.
"We are not in a hurry. We are waiting for the EC to define its policy towards the aeronautic sector," he said. Document lba0000020011124dnap06o4r

Sir Leon Brittan, the  EC's competition commissioner, yesterday fended off an attempt to dilute his  merger-vetting powers. He succeeded in delaying for three months any debate on changing the  Commission's procedures for investigating  mergers.

The challenge was mounted by Martin Bangemann, the  EC's industry commissioner, after Sir Leon's controversial decision to block a Franco-Italian  takeover of Canadian aircraft maker De  Havilland  raised hackles in Paris and Rome. Officials in both countries complained that the ruling undermined the ability of  EC companies to compete
on the international stage.

Mr Bangemann, who is seeking a role in the merger vetting process, argued that the current EC competition rulings do not adequately reflect industrial policy goals.
Sir Leon, however, contended that the changes in the procedures sought by Mr Bangemann would undermine the
Commission's credibility on competition issues and make the process too complicated.

Even though the Commission was due to review merger policy this month, EC sources said most commissioners were reluctant to have a showdown now, given the increasingly tense political atmosphere ahead of the Maastricht summit.
Sir Leon appears to have mustered considerable backing in Brussels for his position.

For the past year, he has been empowered to order a full investigation into a merger without seeking the approval of the Commission as a whole, although the support of the Commission president, Jacques Delors, was needed.

Mr Bangemann's proposals would have forced Sir Leon to get full Commission backing for merger investigations and given other divisions of the Commission, in particular Mr Bangemann's industrial affairs directorate, a role in merger vetting.
The Commission now plans to extend the current system for another three months. Document grdn000020011124dnaq00y09
