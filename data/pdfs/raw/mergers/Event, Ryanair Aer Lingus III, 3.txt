intending to prohibit  Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus,  despite  Ryanair offering to make a number of concessions to get the deal approved, incl an agreement with Flybe to create Flybe Ireland, incl 100m of funding provided by Ryanair, in the event of a successful bid by  Ryanair for Aer Lingus

EU's antitrust body blocks  Ryanair bid to take over rival Irish airline  Aer Lingus

BRUSSELS (AP) - The European Union's antitrust authority on Wednesday blocked  Ryanair's renewed bid to take over rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus,  ruling that it would undermine competition and drive up ticket prices.

The merger of the two Dublin-based airlines would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on almost 50 routes where  Aer Lingus  and Ryanair currently compete, said the  EU Commission, the bloc's executive arm.

"This would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers traveling on these routes," it said, rejecting the remedies offered by Ryanair in return for a green light to its takeover bid.

Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline and already the biggest shareholder in Aer Lingus, vowed to appeal what it called a "political decision" designed to meet the interests of the Irish government. Its offer valued Aer Lingus at about (EURO)700 million ($900 million).

"At a time when airlines in Europe and further afield are merging to form bigger competition champions ... the EU Commission has yet again set back competition and choice in Europe while delaying much-needed consolidation," said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely.

The Irish government has opposed Ryanair ever since the airline surprised virtually everyone by launching its initial bid for Aer Lingus in 2006 just days after the government floated it on the British and Irish stock exchanges. Ireland retained a 25 percent stake that it refused to sell to Ryanair.

So did Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts that own more than 10 percent of shares. The unionized Aer Lingus work force views Ryanair with particular hostility because it refuses to recognize unions, and has a reputation for combative treatment of customers and employees alike.

Irish Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said a Ryanair-run Aer Lingus "would have a significant detrimental effect on competition, connectivity and employment in the Irish market."

The EU said both airlines combined would have controlled 87 percent of all short-haul flights out of Dublin, creating a dominant position on 18 routes and an "outright monopoly" on 28 others.

"The acquisition raised very significant competition concerns since it would have eliminated Ryanair's strongest competitor," said EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia. "In the end the most likely outcome of this transaction would have been quite simple: When flying to and from Ireland, passengers ... would have ended up paying higher prices."

When Ryanair relaunched its takeover bid last year, it expressed hopes that Ireland would agree to sell its stake this time, given the fact that the debt-burdened government is seeking to sell billions in state assets as part of its effort to exit its 2010 international bailout. And Ryanair's detailed pitch to EU authorities included a framework agreement to sell key Aer Lingus routes to two British competitors, British Airways and Flybe.

Ryanair, which has surged ahead of Aer Lingus in Ireland with a larger work force and lower average fares, also promised to trim Aer Lingus ticket prices and increase employment while keeping Aer Lingus as a distinctive higher-service brand with trans-Atlantic routes. Ryanair operates only in Europe, Morocco and the Canary Islands.

"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically inspired prohibition," Kiely said.

The EU Commission has cleared other large airline mergers or takeovers, including the British Airways-Iberia and Lufthansa-Austrian Airlines deals. But Almunia told reporters that Ryanair's bid was different because the two airlines operate principally in the same market and are both based in Dublin. He compared the situation to a proposed merger between two Greece-based airlines, Olympic and Aegean, that the EU blocked in 2011.
Aer Lingus cheered the EU's decision.
"Aer Lingus' position from the outset has been that Ryanair's offer should never have been made," chief executive
Christoph Mueller said in a statement.

The airline is suing Ryanair in an effort to force its rival to divest its 30 percent stake. Britain's competition watchdog also is investigating whether Ryanair's investment in Aer Lingus unfairly influences its competitor's decisions. Ryanair holds no seats on the Aer Lingus board.

Ryanair shares lead ISEQ lower

Copyright (c) 2013, Media World Ltd
The ISEQ dipped back in to the red this morning led by  Ryanair after the  EU rejected its third bid for rival  Aer       Lingus.
By 12:45, the index was down 11.58 points to 3,721.21.

Ryanair will appeal today's decision by Europe's anti-monopoly watchdog to block its third takeover bid for Aer Lingus, potentially leaving the fate of its Irish rival in limbo for years. The rebuff was expected after Ryanair said earlier this month the EU Commission had told it of its intention to block the 694-million-euro bid to seize control of Ireland's 75-year-old former flag carrier. The veto, which is the first time the Commission has twice rejected a proposed takeover, was expected to force Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary to decide whether to finally set its
smaller rival free by selling its 30 percent stake. But by following through on a threat to try to be the first company in a decade to overturn an EU anti-monopoly decision, Ryanair could tie up the stake for years and stymie the
Irish government's efforts to offload its own 25 percent holding. Ryanair stocks fell nearly 1pc or 6c to E5.61 while
Aer Lingus gained 1c to E1.25.

CRH shares fell 6c to E16.62. Holcim has reported adjusted fourth quarter EBITDA of CHF1,019m (+2pc yoy) versus Bloomberg consensus of CHF973m (4-5pc ahead). However, this is before restructuring costs of CHF181m (which look higher than expected) and is on the back of lfl sales growth of 2pc (versus 3pc Q3 and 6pc H1). For the FY EBITDA was up 6pc before restructuring costs (flat when included). "In terms of CRH there is no additional information at a regional level but it is another set of results that highlight the diverging trends between Europe and US. Underlying sales in Europe were down 5pc in both Q4 and FY, while North America was up 2pc in Q4 and +3pc FY. We expect these trends to continue in 2013 resulting in single-digit EBITDA growth for CRH," according to Goodbody's. DCC has completed the acquisition of Kent Pharmaceuticals in line with the time frame
set out by management when the deal was announced last December. Shares in the Irish group, which intends to de-list from the Irish market in favour of London, climbed 27c to E27.02.

Almunia: Ryanair bid bar protects public

EU Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquin Almunia today said that the decision to reject Ryanair's bid for  Aer Lingus  was done in the best interests of the travelling public.

The European Commission earlier today prohibited the proposed takeover of the Irish flag carrier  Aer Lingus  by the low-cost airline  Ryanair.
It said that the acquisition would have combined the two leading airlines operating from Ireland.

"The Commission concluded that the merger would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 46 routes where, currently, Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete vigorously against each other. This would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers travelling on these routes. During the investigation, Ryanair offered remedies. The Commission assessed them thoroughly and carried out several market tests. However the remedies proposed fell short of addressing the competition
concerns raised by the Commission," it found. Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquin Almunia said: "The Commission's decision protects more than 11 million Irish and European passengers who travel each year to and from Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon. For them, the acquisition of Aer Lingus by
Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares. During the procedure, Ryanair had many opportunities to offer remedies and to improve them. However, those proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes." Ryanair and Aer Lingus are by far the most important carriers operating out of Ireland. They compete directly on 46 routes. In a statement, Aer Lingus welcomed the decision. "Aer Lingus Group plc welcomes the decision announced today by the European Commission (EC) prohibiting Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus. This is the first occasion on which the EC has needed to block the same deal twice. It is also Ryanair's third failed offer for Aer Lingus. The full text of
the EC's announcement and frequently asked questions are linked below," it said. It was the third time that the proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair was notified to the Commission. In 2007 the Commission prohibited Ryanair's first attempt to acquire Aer Lingus and this decision was upheld by the EU General Court. In
2009, the second notification by Ryanair was withdrawn. "The Commission took into account the changes in market circumstances since 2007, for example the fact that the market positions of Ryanair and Aer Lingus have become even stronger, with their combined market shares going up from 80pc in 2007 to 87pc in 2012 for
short-haul flights out of Dublin. The number of routes to and from Ireland operated in competition by Ryanair and
Aer Lingus has increased from 35 in 2007 to 46 in 2012."

Ryanair to appeal as EU rejects AL bid

"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns ... Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal." The bid, described by Ryanair as its third and final effort to takeover its rival, included ceding 43 routes to a newly created Irish subsidiary of British airline Flybe (FLYB.L) and handing to
British Airways (ICAG.L) the routes Aer Lingus operates from London's Gatwick Airport. The Commission blocked
Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus in 2007 and Ryanair dropped its second in 2009.

The European Commission Wednesday formally announced its decision to again block  Ryanair's acquisition of Aer Lingus.  According to prepared remarks from  EC vice president of competition policy Joaquín Almunia for a Wednesday press briefing, the acquisition "would have directly harmed passengers, who would have had to pay higher fares as a result."  EC identified "very significant competition concerns" on 46 routes, including 28 which "would have simply led to a monopoly."  EC deemed the remedies proposed by Ryanair as "not sufficient given the seriousness of the competition problems at stake." In 2007 it similarly prohibited Ryanair from purchasing its fellow Irish carrier.  Ryanair again reiterated its intention to appeal the decision.

RYANAIR today said it will appeal R against the  European Commission's decision to block its proposed takeover of Aer Lingus.  Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said: "The acquisition would have most likely led to higher fares." But  Ryanair, which owns almost 30% of  Aer Lingus,  said the move was "motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns".

European Regulators Block  Ryanair Bid to Buy Aer Lingus

BRUSSELS – The European  Commission on Wednesday blocked the third attempt by Ryanair to acquire Aer     Lingus,  saying a union of the two Irish airlines would damage competition and raise prices on air routes to
Ireland.

The decision was widely expected after Ryanair — the largest budget carrier in Europe — said earlier that the commission would prohibit the deal, worth about 700 million euros ($900 million).

Joaquín Almunia said he blocked the acquisition to ensure adequate competition on routes serving Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon that are flown by 11 million passengers each year.

‘‘Currently these two airlines are competing head to head,’’ Mr. Almunia said. ‘‘Remedying problems of such magnitude would have required a countervailing force capable to be a strong and viable competitor to Ryanair — precisely the kind of competitor that Aer Lingus is today.’’
Shares of Ryanair were down 6 euro cents, at 5.60 euros, in afternoon trading in Dublin; Aer Lingus stock was up
1 cent, at 1.25 euros.
Aer Lingus, which had rejected Ryanair’s offers, said Wednesday that it welcomed the commission’s decision.
‘‘Aer Lingus’ position from the outset has been that Ryanair’s offer should never have been made,’’ said Christoph
Mueller, chief executive of Aer Lingus.

Ryanair, which already owns about 30 percent of Aer Lingus, reiterated that it would appeal the decision to the bloc’s second-highest tribunal, the General Court of the  European Court of Justice.

Ryanair accused Mr. Almunia of protecting Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, against a takeover by an upstart. The company also contends that the regulator applied a double standard because he approved the takeover by British Airways and Iberia of British Midland International last year under a simplified procedure.

“We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns, and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically inspired prohibition,” said Robin Kiely, a spokesman for Ryanair.

Various companies successfully appealed a string of blocked mergers a decade ago to what was then called the Court of First Instance, which found flaws in the reasoning of commission officials. But competition experts in Brussels said that such mistakes were highly unlikely in the case concerning Ryanair.

‘‘Companies that claim that merger decisions that don’t go their way are political are wasting their time,’’ said Fiona Carlin, the head of the competition practice at Baker & McKenzie in Brussels. ‘‘The commission has become increasingly careful about going the full mile in difficult cases in view of appeals.’’

Prolonged litigation could have wider ramifications, making it more difficult for the Irish government to sell its 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus. Ireland agreed to sell that stake under the terms of an international bailout finalized in November 2010, although that agreement did not set a deadline for the sale.

The deal is the fourth Mr. Almunia has blocked since he took over as the region’s antitrust chief in February 2010. Last month, the  commission thwarted the attempt by  U.P.S. to buy TNT Express.

The decision on Wednesday is the latest chapter in years of acrimony between the commission and Ryanair’s pugnacious chief executive, Michael K. O’Leary, who has repeatedly criticized commission officials for decisions that curtailed his ambitions.

The enmity between Mr. O’Leary and the commission developed last decade when the two sides began a running battle over whether Ryanair received illegal state subsidies that enabled the airline to open up routes to regional airports. Those airports were often some distance from major transport hubs, but still close enough to lure passengers away from more established carriers.
Last year, the commission announced new investigations into the effect of discounts Ryanair had received at
Lübeck-Blankensee Airport in Germany and the Klagenfurt regional airport in Austria.

Mr. O’Leary has sharply criticized the commission for failing to do more to save money by booking its officials on low-cost airlines like his own. Ryanair also has said its arrangements with all  European Union airports comply with the bloc’s competition rules.

The competition authority blocked Ryanair’s first bid for Aer Lingus in 2007 on the grounds that the combined airline would have had a monopoly on too many routes. At the time, Mr. O’Leary accused the commission of bowing to political pressure from the Irish government, which opposed the deal. The airline abandoned a second attempt in 2009 because of opposition from the Irish government.

On Wednesday, Ryanair accused the commission of holding it to a higher standard than other airlines seeking mergers after it had offered “historic and unprecedented” concessions.

Among other items, Ryanair had offered to allow two competitor airlines to serve Dublin, Cork and Shannon; give those airlines more than half of the short-distance business currently belonging to Aer Lingus; agree to transfer airport slots in Britain to allow British Airways to serve Ireland from both Gatwick and Heathrow. Ryanair also had offered Flybe, a competitor, 100 million euros in financing to make it “a commercially profitable and viable entity” in Ireland.
On Wednesday, Mr. Almunia insisted that there had been no double standard.

‘‘We have followed exactly the same approach as we did in all these previous cases’’ involving assessments of tie-ups between airlines, Mr. Almunia said.

Mr. Almunia acknowledged that final approval for decisions to block mergers are taken by a commission of political appointees, each representing one of the Union’s 27 member states. But he said that such decisions were ‘‘based on a very, very profound, sound, sensible and detailed legal and economic analysis.’’

The commission said that Ryanair and Aer Lingus had strengthened their positions in the Irish market since the commission refused the previous deal in 2007, and that the merger would have created an ‘‘outright monopoly’’ on 28 short-distance routes serving Ireland.
The commission also said the barriers to entering the Irish market were too high for potential competitors.

The commission’s ‘‘market investigation showed that there was no prospect that any new carrier would enter the Irish market after the merger, in particular by the creation of a base at the relevant Irish airports, and challenge the new entity on a sufficient scale,’’ it said in a statement. ‘‘Higher prices for passengers would have been the likely outcome.’’

The commission’s decision was expected to revive a 2012 inquiry by a British competition watchdog into whether Ryanair’s stake in Aer Lingus gave it unfair influence over Aer Lingus’s business and strategy. The investigation, opened in June, was suspended after Ryanair announced its latest takeover offer.

Rory Taylor, a spokesman for the Competition Commission in Britain, said Wednesday that the regulator expected to restart its investigation ‘’shortly,’’ with an eye to concluding its work in the summer.

EU bars Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus

Brussels (AFP)--27Feb2013/653 am EST/1153 GMT

The European Commission said Wednesday it had barred a third attempt by low-cost airline pioneer  Ryanair to take over its Irish rival  Aer Lingus  due to concerns passengers would lose out.

The "merger would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 46 routes ... this would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers," the Commission said in a statement.

It said Ryanair offered several remedies to meet these competition concerns but they "fell short" of what was needed.

Ryanair's proposals "were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in the statement.
Ryanair tried in 2007 to take control of Aer Lingus, in which the Irish government holds a major stake, but the
Commission prohibited the deal on competition grounds.
The company tried again in 2009 but decided to withdraw when it became clear Brussels remained opposed. Changes since 2007 had only reinforced the two airlines' position in the Irish market, the statement said, adding
that the deal would "have removed the currently vibrant competition between" them.

"In short, customers' traveling options would have been substantially reduced and it is unlikely that competitors would have been able to sufficiently constrain the merged entity in its market behavior. Higher prices for passengers would have been the likely outcome."

RYANAIR VOW ON AER LINGUS TAKEOVER
By Lyndsey Telford, Press Association

Ryanair has vowed to fight in court a rejection by  European officials of its renewed takeover bid for rival  Aer         Lingus.

The airline accused the  European Commission of acting unfairly and failing to apply its own competition rules and precedents to the latest takeover plan.

"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition," Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said.

"Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal against this manifestly unjust prohibition."

The airline said the takeover bid, rejected today by the EU Commission, was supported by a historic and unprecedented remedies package.

The "radical" bid included two upfront buyers - BA/IAG and Flybe - to take over around half of Aer Lingus's short-haul business.

The takeover plan - a third bid by Michael O'Leary for Aer Lingus - appeared to have been boosted earlier this month when Flybe agreed to fly 43 of Aer Lingus's short-haul routes, easing competition concerns.

There had also been a commitment from the IAG airline group to run overlapping Aer Lingus/Ryanair routes between Dublin and London Gatwick to ensure competition.
Ryanair said the EC's decision to block its latest bid was a political one to protect the interests of the Irish
Government - which holds a 25% share in Aer Lingus - and not one based on competition rules.

The airline submitted its final package of takeover plans and commitments earlier this month following a series of meetings with European chiefs.
It said the package addressed the shortcomings in its previous two failed bids in 2007 and 2012.

Earlier this year, Aer Lingus posted strong 2012 results with operating profit up 41% to 69.1 million euro (£59.5 million).

The former flag carrier, which was privatised in 2006, maintains that Ryanair is its only significant competitor on most routes in and out of Ireland.

But Ryanair spokesman Mr Kiely said the EC had set back competition and choice in Europe with its latest rejection of the consolidation.

"This decision leaves Aer Lingus as a small, isolated airline and leaves the two Irish airlines at the mercy of the Government-owned Dublin Airport monopoly, which continues to increase passenger charges, deliver third-rate services and oversee traffic declines," Mr Kiely said.

"Over the past five years, as Dublin Airport has doubled its passenger charges, its traffic has declined from 24 million to 18 million per annum, while Aer Lingus continues to get smaller as it wet leases short-haul jet aircraft to

Page 18 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Virgin to operate new routes from Heathrow to regional UK airports (making no contribution to Irish tourism), rents long-haul aircraft to charter companies outside of Ireland, and transfers more and more of its short-haul routes to smaller, turbo-prop aircraft."
mfl
Aer Lingus said consumers were being better served by vigorous competition set by the two airlines. Chief executive Christoph Mueller said the takeover bid should never have been made.
"The series of inadequate remedy offers presented by Ryanair only underlines the view that Ryanair made its offer without any reasonable belief that it could obtain clearance," he said.
Ryanair owns 29.8% of Aer Lingus. mfl
Joaquin Almunia, European Commissioner for competition, said the decision protects more than 11 million Irish and European passengers flying in and out of Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon.
"For them, the acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares," he said.

"During the procedure, Ryanair had many opportunities to offer remedies and to improve them. However, those proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes."
The Commission said a takeover would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or dominant position on
46 routes.
It would have reduced choice and most likely increased prices, it added. end
The ruling found that takeover would have created an outright monopoly on 28 routes.
It said that only charter airlines would have provided competition on another 11 routes and on another seven
Ryanair and Aer Lingus are the closest competitors despite the presence of up to three other airlines.

The Commission also said that because of the dominance of the two Irish airlines there was no prospect that any new carrier would enter the market.

"In short, customers' travelling options would have been substantially reduced and it is unlikely that competitors would have been able to sufficiently constrain the merged entity in its market behaviour," the ruling said.
"Higher prices for passengers would have been the likely outcome." end
Leo Varadkar, Ireland's Transport Minister, said the Government believed a merger was bad.

"Following detailed consideration of the proposal, the Government's strongly held view is that a takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have a significant detrimental effect on competition, connectivity and employment in the Irish market," he said.

"Similar to my own view, the Commission considered that the remedies proposed by Ryanair were insufficient to address the competition concerns."

Mr Varadkar said Ireland was fortunate to have a number of strong and profitable airlines and competition benefiting consumers.

Aer Lingus welcomes European Commission prohibition of Ryanair's offer

Dublin & London, 27 February 2013: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") welcomes the decision announced today by the European Commission (EC) prohibiting Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus. This is the first occasion on which the EC has needed to block the same deal twice. It is also Ryanair's third failed offer for Aer Lingus. The full text of the EC's announcement and frequently asked questions are linked below:

http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-167_en.htm

http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-144_en.htm

The number of routes into and out of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete has sharply increased since the first offer was blocked in 2007, so the repeated prohibition was always to be expected. Aer Lingus is Ryanair's only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes, and both business and leisure travellers are well served by the vigorous competition that has been preserved between these two carriers.
Aer Lingus recognises the careful and detailed investigation conducted by the EC. Christoph Mueller, CEO of Aer
Lingus, said:

"Aer Lingus' position from the outset has been that Ryanair's offer should never have been made. The series of inadequate remedy offers presented by Ryanair only underlines the view that Ryanair made its offer without any reasonable belief that it could obtain clearance. "

Aer Lingus continues to cooperate with the UK Competition Commission (UK CC) in its investigation into Ryanair's 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus. The UK CC investigation began following the referral by the UK's Office of Fair Trading on 15 June 2012, which observed that "there is a realistic prospect that its stake has resulted or will result in a substantial lessening of competition." The announcement of Ryanair's bid on 19 June, just four days later, was clearly motivated by a desire to derail the UK CC's investigation.

Aer Lingus remains focussed on financial and operational performance. Aer Lingus is a much stronger airline today than it was at the time of the previous Ryanair offers. The 2012 preliminary results announced on 6
February 2013 demonstrated that Aer Lingus delivered an excellent overall performance. During 2012, the Company continued to win market share from Ryanair and other competitors, while also increasing operating profit, total revenue, passenger numbers, average yields and load factors. Aer Lingus is well positioned for future growth and continues to implement its successful 'value carrier' business model.

EU blocks  Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus; European competition authorities have blocked  Ryanair's
latest attempt to take over its Irish rival Aer Lingus,  prompting an immediate  warning  from the low cost carrier that it will appeal the "manifestly unjust" and "political" decision.

The European Commission said the €694m (£600m) proposed deal would have "harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 46 routes where, currently,  Aer Lingus  and Ryanair compete vigorously against each other".

Ryanair had sought to alleviate competition concerns by striking a deal with UK regional carrier Flybe, which had agreed to take on 43  Aer Lingus  routes if the deal was approved. British Airways-owned IAG had also agreed to operate routes between Ireland the Gatwick airport.

The Commission said it had assessed the remedies offered by Ryanair "thoroughly" and had also carried out several market tests.

"However the remedies proposed fell short of addressing the competition concerns raised by the Commission," it said in a statement on Wednesday.

European Competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia added: "The Commission's decision protects more than 11 million Irish and European passengers who travel each year to and from Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon.

"For them, the acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares. During the procedure, Ryanair had many opportunities to offer remedies and to improve them.

"However, those proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes."

Ryanair, which has made three attempts to buy Aer Lingus since 2006, said the decision was "political" and accused the EC of failing to "apply its own competition rules and precedents in a fair and dispassionate manner".

RyanAer bid finally  grounded

RYANAIR'S seven-year pursuit of  Aer Lingus  looks certain to be grounded forever by the  European
Commission.
The EC — Europe's antimonopoly watchdog — is set to tell boss Michael O'Leary it will veto his airline's
'694million bid.
It is the first time the EC has twice rejected a takeover proposal.
The veto could force Ryanair to decide whether to finally set Aer Lingus free by selling its 30 per cent stake.
But if O'Leary follows through on a threat to attempt to become the first company in a decade to overturn an EU
anti-monopoly decision, the process could tie up the stake for years.

It would also likely scare off other investors and frustrate the Government's efforts to offload its own 25 per cent stake — a move demanded by the Troika.

Analyst David Holohan of brokerage Merrion Capital said: "The government and Aer Lingus will simply have to wait and see what Ryanair chooses to do."

EU obstructs Ryanair’s  third takeover attempt of Aer Lingus

Persistence has failed to pay off for  Ryanair after its third attempt to buy  Aer Lingus  was blocked by the
European Commission on competition grounds today.

The EC’s vice-president, Joaquin Almunia, criticised the low-cost airline for offering “simply inadequate" concessions to deal with the “very serious competition problems" raised by the proposed €694 million deal.

Between them, Aer Lingus and Ryanair have an 87 per cent market share on flights out of Dublin, according to the EC’s analysis. Ryanair had offered to create a new competitor by hiving off 43 routes to Flybe.

However, Mr Almunia made it clear that he did not think much of this offer, which comes as FlyBe grapples with serious financial difficulties.

“The Commission found that Flybe was not a suitable purchaser capable of competing sufficiently," said the EC’s official ruling.

Flybe’s shares dropped by 3.4 per cent to 49.25p. Aer Lingus’s stock barely budged on Dublin’s stockmarket, while Ryanair’s shares slipped 1 per cent to 5.60.

Mr Almunia said blocking the deal protects the interests of 11 million passengers who fly in and out of Irish airports every year. He suggested a combination of the two airlines would lead to higher fares.

But Ryanair vowed to appeal to the EU’s General Court in Luxembourg, claiming the decision was “manifestly motivated by narrow political interests" and had not been reached in a “fair and dispassionate manner".

Ryanair has been trying to buy Aer Lingus since 2007. Its latest attempt was prompted, in part, by the Irish government’s decision to sell its 25 per cent stake in the national flag-carrier in order to reduce the country’s budget deficit.

The prospect of a combative, no-frills operator purchasing Aer Lingus filled Irish politicians with dread and the budget carrier’s insistence on appealing was mocked by the country’s transport minister, Leo Varadkar.

“Ryanair spends a lot of time and money in the courts and generally doesn’t get much success for their actions," said Mr Varadkar.

The deal is the second merger blocked by Brussels this year. Mr Almunia had previously halted UPS’s attempt to purchase the Dutch parcel delivery company TNT.

Aer Lingus’s chief executive, Christoph Mueller, complained that the entire episode had been a pointless distraction: “The series of inadequate remedy offers presented by Ryanair only underlines the view that Ryanair made its offer without any reasonable belief that it could obtain clearance."

Ruling on Ryanair takeover bid due; BUSINESS IN BRIEF

THE European Commission will announce its decision today on  Ryanair's bid for  Aer Lingus  Group, said
Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the Brussels-based regulator.

Mr Colombani referred in an email to the commission making a decision on the proposed acquisition of  Aer           Lingus by Ryanair today. He said an earlier statement by another spokesman that the  EU would take a "major decision" referred to a merger case.  Ryanair said earlier this month that the  EU was planning to block its
takeover attempt for its Irish rival.

The European Commission will announce its decision today on  Ryanair's third bid for  Aer Lingus  today.
It is expected the  EC will reject Micheal O'Leary's €694m bid.

Ryanair said earlier this month that its information suggested the EU was planning to block its takeover attempt for the airline, in which it holds a nearly 30% stake.
Ryanair is likely to appeal today's decision, if it does not go their way. Document IRISEX0020130227e92r000b6

Ryanair vows to fight EC rejection of Aer Lingus  takeover

Ryanair has vowed to fight in court a rejection by  European officials of its renewed takeover bid for rival  Aer         Lingus.

The airline accused the  European Commission of acting unfairly and failing to apply its own competition rules and precedents to the latest takeover plan.

"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition," Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said.

"Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal against this manifestly unjust prohibition."

The airline said the takeover bid, rejected today by the EU Commission, was supported by a historic and unprecedented remedies package.

The "radical" bid included two upfront buyers – BA/IAG and Flybe – to take over around half of Aer Lingus’s short-haul business.

The takeover plan – a third bid by Michael O’Leary for Aer Lingus – appeared to have been boosted earlier this month when Flybe agreed to fly 43 of Aer Lingus’s short-haul routes, easing competition concerns.

There had also been a commitment from the IAG airline group to run overlapping Aer Lingus/Ryanair routes between Dublin and London Gatwick to ensure competition.
Ryanair said the EC’s decision to block its latest bid was a political one to protect the interests of the Irish
Government – which holds a 25% share in Aer Lingus – and not one based on competition rules.

The airline submitted its final package of takeover plans and commitments earlier this month following a series of meetings with European chiefs.
It said the package addressed the shortcomings in its previous two failed bids in 2007 and 2012. Earlier this year, Aer Lingus posted strong 2012 results with operating profit up 41% to €69.1m.
The former flag carrier, which was privatised in 2006, maintains that Ryanair is its only significant competitor on most routes in and out of Ireland.

But Ryanair spokesman Mr Kiely said the EC had set back competition and choice in Europe with its latest rejection of the consolidation.

"This decision leaves Aer Lingus as a small, isolated airline and leaves the two Irish airlines at the mercy of the Government-owned Dublin Airport monopoly, which continues to increase passenger charges, deliver third-rate services and oversee traffic declines," Mr Kiely said.

"Over the past five years, as Dublin Airport has doubled its passenger charges, its traffic has declined from 24 million to 18 million per annum, while Aer Lingus continues to get smaller as it wet leases short-haul jet aircraft to Virgin to operate new routes from Heathrow to regional UK airports (making no contribution to Irish tourism), rents

long-haul aircraft to charter companies outside of Ireland, and transfers more and more of its short-haul routes to smaller, turbo-prop aircraft."

* Ryanair to challenge European Commission ruling
* Lawyer sees possible implications for Greek airline deal
(Adds details on UK probe, analyst on appeal) By Foo Yun Chee and Conor Humphries
BRUSSELS/DUBLIN, Feb 27 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have blocked a third attempt by Ryanair to buy Irish rival Aer Lingus, a ruling Europe's biggest low-cost airline called politically motivated and vowed to challenge in court.

The European Commission, which vetoed Ryanair's first takeover bid for Aer Lingus in 2007, said on Wednesday Ryanair had not offered sufficient concessions to allay concerns about the combined company's dominance or monopoly on 46 routes.

It said the 694 million euro ($907 million) bid, which was opposed by the Irish government, could hurt competition and lead to over 11 million passengers paying more.

"For (Irish and European passengers), the acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

Ryanair, which owns 30 percent of Aer Lingus and has been battling to buy Ireland's 75-year-old former flag carrier to strengthen its market position, had promised to divest some of Aer Lingus's routes to British airline Flybe and British Airways in an attempt to win over regulators.
Ryanair described its concessions as unprecedented and rejected the Commission's arguments.
"We believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition," it said. Ryanair's appeal could scare off other possible strategic investors in Aer Lingus and frustrate the Irish
government's efforts to divest its 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus, part of Ireland's 85-billion-euro EU/IMF bailout.
Ryanair shares closed down 1 percent at 5.60 euros. Aer Lingus's were up 0.4 percent at 1.245 euros. UK COMPETITION PROBE
The Irish government welcomed the Commission's decision.

"The government's view very strongly was that we want to see lots of airlines flying in and out of Ireland, lots of competition and lots of routes," Transport Minister Leo Varadkar told Irish national broadcaster RTE.

"Ryanair spends a lot of time and money in the courts and generally doesn't get much success from their actions. But that's a decision for them," he said of Ryanair's appeal.

Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller said Ryanair's appeal was motivated by a desire to derail a probe undertaken by Britain's Competition Commission into Ryanair's stake in the carrier.

Page 30 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Competition Commission probe was paused after Ryanair challenged it jurisdiction to make a ruling while the
European Commission was investigating a merger.

It has indicated, however, that an appeal by Ryanair over the European Commission decision was unlikely to delay its investigation further.

John Schmidt, a partner at London-based Shepherd and Wedderburn said the European Commission decision would likely make it more likely to rule that Ryanair's 30 percent stake gives it unfair influence over its rival.

"Given the case on substance and the Commission's margin of discretion I am not sure an appeal will ultimately be successful," Schmidt said.

Some antitrust lawyers said the Commission's decision could have implications for another airline merger in the pipeline.

"The Greek carriers Olympic and Aegean will be following this closely for pointers as to how their planned tie-up will be analysed," said Paul McGeown, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Brussels.

Aegean Airlines unveiled its 72-million-euro bid for Olympic Air in October last year, two years after the Commission rejected its first offer. Aegean said its latest proposal aims to ensure its survival in a shrinking market.

The companies are now in informal discussions with the EU competition authority and are expected to formally file for approval of the deal in the coming days.

Ryanair to appeal EU veto of Aer Lingus  merger

* Ryanair to appeal European Commission decision
* Ryanair says decision political, plans legal action
* Decision likely to end seven year pursuit of Aer Lingus

DUBLIN, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Budget airline Ryanair will appeal Wednesday's decision by Europe's anti-monopoly watchdog to block its third takeover bid for Aer Lingus , potentially leaving the fate of its Irish rival in limbo for years.

The rebuff was expected after Ryanair said earlier this month the EU Commission had told it of its intention to block the 694-million-euro ($917 million) bid to seize control of Ireland's 75-year-old former flag carrier.
The veto, which is the first time the Commission has twice rejected a proposed takeover, was expected to force
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary to decide whether to finally set its smaller rival free by selling its 30 percent stake.

But by following through on a threat to try to be the first company in a decade to overturn an EU anti-monopoly decision, Ryanair could tie up the stake for years and stymie the Irish government's efforts to offload its own 25 percent holding.
"We believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition," a
Ryanair spokesman said in a statement.

"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns ... Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal."

The bid, described by Ryanair as its third and final effort to takeover its rival, included ceding 43 routes to a newly created Irish subsidiary of British airline Flybe and handing to British Airways the routes Aer Lingus operates from London's Gatwick Airport.

The Commission blocked Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus in 2007 and Ryanair dropped its second in 2009.

UK small caps gain 0.3 percent in early afternoon trade, in line with the mid-caps and the blue chips.

Flybe falls 2 percent after fellow airline  Ryanair's bid for  Aer Lingus  was blocked by EU regulators, meaning that the agreement with the Irish airline to set up Flybe Ireland and receive 43  European routes and nine Airbus aircraft as part of the deal will not go through.

Flybe had surged 20 percent when the deal was announced, with analysts having said that the deal offered Flybe the chance to diversify.

Synectics sees heavy trade of 1.3 times its 90 day average, gaining 0.7 percent and rising to 368.5p after finnCap raises its target price to 400p from 350p, retaining a 'buy' rating on the stock.

"2012 proved a good year for Synectics with a strong performance from the Network division and very strong performance in H2 from the Industrial division driving upgrades to estimates," analysts at finnCap say in a note.

"In view of the confident tone accompanying the success of the group's two key profit generators for 2012, we have adjusted our TP (target price) to 400p".

27 February 2013 – The  European Commission (EC) today announced it has banned Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc’s (LON:RYA) third attempt to buy the 70% it does not already own in smaller rival  Aer          Lingus  Group Plc (LON:AERL).

In a statement, the  EC said it had prohibited the buyout as it would have combined the two leading Irish airlines into an entity with a dominant position on 46 routes where they currently compete against each other. The move would have led to a reduced choice and higher prices for customers.

The regulator also noted that the concessions offered by Ryanair during the transaction review were inadequate and had fallen short of addressing the particular issues. The remedies package included a deal to transfer planes and routes to UK sector player Flybe Group Plc (LON:FLYB) plus a cash contribution of EUR100m (USD393m). Furthermore, the suitor had agreed to sell all of its and Aer Lingus’ London-Gatwick operations to British Airways Plc.

This is the third time Ryanair fails to take over its rival after the EC blocked its first effort in 2007, while the second notification by the company in 2009 was withdrawn.
Ryanair’s latest offer was EUR1.30 per share and valued Aer Lingus at about EUR694m. Status: Bidding Type group: Type: Corporate acquisition Buyer: Ryanair Holdings Plc Comment: The bid valued the target at USD910m.

27 February 2013 – Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (LON:RYA) on Wednesday confirmed it will appeal the decision by the  European Commission (EC) to block its third effort to buy out smaller rival  Aer Lingus  Group Plc (LON:AERL).

Ryanair claims the the  EC decision was a political one and aims to “pander to the vested interests of the Irish government”, which itself owns a 25% stake in  Aer Lingus.

In its statement, the regulator said it had vetoed the transaction as it would have formed an entity with a dominant position on 46 routes where the two airlines currently compete against each other. The move would have led to a reduced choice and higher prices for customers. The commission also noted that the concessions offered by Ryanair during the investigation were inadequate and had fallen short of addressing the particular issues.

On the other hand, Ryanair says its remedies package was “historic and unprecedented”. It envisaged the transfer of approximately half of Aer Lingus' short-haul business to two parties, namely Flybe Group Plc (LON:FLYB) and British Airways Plc.
Ryanair’s latest offer for Aer Lingus was EUR1.30 (USD1.70) per share and valued the company at about
EUR694m. It has so far failed to acquire the 70% it does not already own in its rival twice, in 2007 and in 2009.

Ryanair Will Appeal EU Commission’s “Political” Decision  to Prohibit its Offer For Aer Lingus
2,043 words
27 February 2013
M2 Presswire
MTPW
English
© 2013, M2 Communications. All rights reserved.
Ryanair, Europes only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (Feb 27) confirmed that it will appeal the  EU Commissions announced decision to prohibit its latest offer for  Aer Lingus,  which was supported by an historic and unprecedented remedies package that included not one, but two upfront buyers (BA/IAG & Flybe) to take over approximately half of  Aer Lingus  short-haul business.

The transfer to these upfront buyers of  Aer Lingus  business on the 46 crossover routes identified by the  EU Commission, together with the relevant slots, aircraft, personnel and branding, was ensured by binding, irrevocable commitments by those upfront buyers including Board approvals.

The history of the EUs treatment of Ryanairs two offers for Aer Lingus conclusively proves that this prohibition is a political decision to pander to the vested interests of the Irish Government (a minority 25% shareholder in Aer Lingus) and is not one that is based on a fair and reasonable application of EU competition rules or precedent airline merger approvals in Europe.
The 2007 EU Prohibition Decision

In June 2007, the European Commission prohibited Ryanairs first offer for Aer Lingus on the basis that Ryanairs then remedies package: - did not deliver any upfront buyers or any guaranteed competitor entry; and - did not address all of the identified 35 crossover routes between Ryanair and Aer Lingus.

Ryanairs 2006 offer for Aer Lingus was also hindered by the fact that Dublin Airport (with 24mppa and only one terminal) was found to be suffering congestion and entry constraints. This is the context in which Ryanair approached the European Commission with its latest 2012 offer for Aer Lingus.
The 2012 EU Statement of Objections

The Commission accepted that, since traffic had fallen (from 24m to 18m) at Dublin Airport and a second terminal had opened in 2010, there were no congestion issues as had existed in 2007. However, in its November 2012
Statement of Objections, the EU Commission raised the following concerns:
- Ryanairs commitments did not cover all 46 crossover routes;

- The implementation of Ryanairs commitments was unclear because Ryanair had failed to demonstrate that upfront buyers would take up all of Ryanairs remedies;

- Ryanairs proposed transfer of Aer Lingus Heathrow slots was legally unclear (despite the fact that Heathrow, as part of the DublinLondon city pair, did not require a remedy since this city pair was already served by two other strong competitors BA and Air France);

- Ryanairs signed Heads of Terms with potential upfront buyers were not irrevocable or supported by Board approvals;

- Ryanairs block space agreement (BSA) proposals, under which some crossover routes would be addressed by selling seats on Aer Lingus flights to a competitor airline, would not replicate effective competition;
- There was no provision in the event of failed entry by upfront buyers;

- There was a risk that Ryanair and the upfront buyers would not compete aggressively because of long term structural links.

Ryanairs Comprehensive and Final Commitments Package

In February 2013 (after a series of meetings with the EU, and associated iterations of its proposals) Ryanair submitted a final remedies package which addressed both the shortcomings in its 2007 remedies package and also the concerns raised by the Commission in its November 2012 statement of objections.
Its key final remedies included:
- Instead of BSAs, Ryanair committed to transfer Aer Lingus flights on all 46 crossover routes to both BA/IAG and
Flybe;
- BA/IAG and Flybe signed irrevocable agreements with Ryanair that they would implement the upfront buyer
(UFB) remedies package, including opening bases at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports;

- Ryanair agreed to transfer Aer Lingus existing business and operations on 43 of the 46 crossover routes, together with aircraft, personnel, slots and all attendant assets, to Flybe;
- Ryanair agreed to transfer both slots and traffic on the remaining 3 of the 46 crossover routes to BA/IAG;

- Ryanair removed any concerns over the transferability of Heathrow slots by agreeing to transfer both Aer Lingus and Ryanairs Gatwick slots to BA/IAG so that BA could serve Dublin, Cork and Shannon from both Gatwick and Heathrow airports with no question mark over slot transferability or the implementation of the remedy;

- Ryanair addressed the Commissions concerns about the commitment of Flybe to the Irish market by undertaking to deliver Flybe Ireland as a commercially profitable and viable entity, with an equity base of at least
100m to ensure that Flybe Ireland was sustainable for the long term;

- Ryanairs remedies package also addressed the Irish Governments stated concerns by preserving Aer Lingus operations (and connectivity) on the DublinHeathrow route (despite the fact that much of Irelands connectivity now takes place on connecting services through Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Abu Dhabi and Dubai airports). The arrival of BA and Flybe Ireland also ensured that jobs in the sector would increase, not reduce;

- Furthermore, Ryanairs remedies package resolved all potential competition routes (i.e. those routes where Ryanair and Aer Lingus dont presently compete but might in the future) by offering slot divestitures, in perpetuity, to any other airline wishing to enter these potential competition routes.
EU Market Test Response

An EU DG Comp market test questionnaire related to Ryanairs final remedy package was circulated to relevant parties across Europe and showed that: (1) a clear majority of respondents agreed that the assets divested to Flybe were sufficient; and (2) EU airlines representing a majority of air passengers in Europe were supportive of key remedies proposed.

Recent EU Airline Merger Approvals Ryanairs remedies package in the Aer Lingus case, which was supported by irrevocable upfront buyer agreements from BA/IAG and Flybe, was submitted to the European Commission after the Commissions recent approval of other similar airline mergers including BA/IAGs takeover of BMI at Heathrow. In that case, the EU Commission approved BAs purchase of BMI (in Phase 1) despite the fact that the two airlines were the number one and number two holders of slots at Heathrow. Following a phase one merger review, the Commission accepted remedies from BA/IAG which involved the transfer of just 12 daily slot pairs to competitor airlines to operate competition on just 6 routes from Heathrow. No upfront buyers were required and those slots that were offered up to competitors will not be taken up until 12 months after BA/IAG completed its takeover of BMI.
Conclusions

It is untenable for the Commission to argue on competition grounds why they have rejected what is an unprecedented and revolutionary remedies package in the Ryanair/Aer Lingus case just months after they had granted phase one approval to a similar IAG/BMI airline merger, which concerned the number one and number two airlines based at the heavily-congested London Heathrow Airport. In the case of Ryanair and Aer Lingus, which are the number one and number two airlines based in Dublin, Ryanair delivered a structural divestment remedy including, not one, but two upfront buyers, irrevocable and binding commitments from those two upfront buyers, divestiture of Aer Lingus flights in each of the 46 crossover routes, together with offers of slot divestitures for an unlimited period of time on all other potential competition routes. Ryanairs latest remedies package conclusively addressed all of the objections raised by the Commission in its 2007 prohibition decision, and
Page 49 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
comprehensively resolved all of the competition issues raised by the Commission in its November 2012 statement of objections.

On this basis, Ryanair concludes that it has no alternative to, and very good grounds for, an appeal of the prohibition decision to the European Courts. It is clear that Ryanair, as Europes only ultra-low cost airline, is being held to a different and considerably higher standard by the European Commission than any other EU flag carrier airline. Given that Ryanairs remedies package would have (1) resulted in not one, but two new competitor airlines opening bases at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports; (2) totally devolved more than half of Aer Lingus short-haul business to these airlines; (3) ensured long term competition on these routes from two of the UKs largest and well known airline brands; and (4) addressed the Irish Governments stated concerns about Heathrow slots, connectivity, jobs and competition, Ryanair does not believe that its remedies package has been rejected for any reason other than pandering to the narrow (and misguided) political interests of the Irish Government.

At a time when even Aer Lingus accepts that it has no long term independent future (its CEO, Christoph Mueller, stated in July 2011: We need partners to fulfil our mission to connect Ireland with the world. We are too small to do it on ourselves. So we need partnerships.) and at a time when the European Commission has rubberstamped every other significant EU airline merger in recent years with considerably fewer and less effective remedies than those proposed by Ryanair, this prohibition is clearly not based on EU competition rules or any EU airline merger precedent.

Ryanairs Robin Kiely said: The EU Commission has regrettably reversed its own precedents in order to prohibit Ryanairs offer for Aer Lingus. Ryanairs radical remedies package clearly addressed all of the concerns raised by the EU both in its 2007 prohibition and in its November 2012 statement of objections.

At a time when airlines in Europe and further afield are merging to form bigger competition champions (witness American Airlines merger with US Airways last week and Emirates recent strategic joint-venture with Qantas) the EU Commission has yet again set back competition and choice in Europe while delaying much-needed consolidation. This decision leaves Aer Lingus as a small, isolated airline and leaves the two Irish airlines at the mercy of the Government-owned Dublin Airport monopoly, which continues to increase passenger charges, deliver third-rate services and oversee traffic declines. Over the past 5 years, as Dublin Airport has doubled its
passenger charges, its traffic has declined from 24m to 18m per annum, while Aer Lingus continues to get smaller as it: (1) wet leases short-haul jet aircraft to Virgin to operate new routes from Heathrow to regional UK airports (making no contribution to Irish tourism); (2) rents long-haul aircraft to charter companies outside of Ireland; and (3) transfers more and more of its short-haul routes to smaller, turbo-prop aircraft.

Ryanair regrets that the EU Commission has again failed to apply its own competition rules and precedents in a fair and dispassionate manner. We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition. Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal against this manifestly unjust prohibition.

Commission blocks  merger between Aer Lingus  - Ryanair

The European Commission did not approve the acquisition of the Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus by the low-cost airline Ryanair. The new merger entity would have led to price increases and harm fair competition.

Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "The Commission's decision protects more than 11 million Irish and European passengers who travel each year to and from Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon. For them, the acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares. During the procedure, Ryanair had many opportunities to offer remedies and to improve them. However, those proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes."

Ryanair proposed several packages of remedies. In concrete terms, Ryanair has proposed&"the divestiture of Aer Lingus' operations on 43 overlap routes to Flybe and the cession of take-off and landing slots to IAG/British Airways at London airports, so that IAG/British Airways would operate on 3 routes (Dublin-London,
Shannon-London, and Cork-London)”. The European Commission under the EU Merger Regulation conducted an in-depth investigation. It gathered views from a large number of market participants in Ireland and internationally. The Commission examined Ryanair’s proposals for three times.

It was the third time that the proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair was notified to the Commission. To the end, the Commission concluded that the new merger entity will reduce competition and will increase prices.

Ryanair-Aer  Lingus  merger grounded once again

Europe, Feb. 27 -- Brussels has blocked  Ryanair's latest attempt to takeover  Aer Lingus,  maintaining the same standpoint as in 2007 when the  EU suggested that a merger would cause too many issues with competition in the region.

Having already had three bids rejected in the past eight years,  Ryanair had taken extensive measures in trying to convince the regulators that any such merger would be of benefit to the industry, but it seems as though their pleas have fallen on deaf ears.

Higher fares for passengers and too large a monopoly of the routes between the UK and Ireland were indicated as the main concerns, by the EU's competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia.

This is the first ever case of the EU blocking a proposed merger more than once and it has left a sour taste in the mouth of charismatic Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary.

He has described the decision as "manifestly unjust" and has indicated that it is pandering "to the vested interests of the government". Unsurprisingly, as a result, he has announced that his company will appeal the decision in
due course.

His latest bid to push through the merger saw numerous concessions on his previous attempts in a plea to the powers that be to show that any such takeover would not have a detrimental affect on the rest of the market.

The first of which would have involved the de facto break-up of Aer Lingus itself, while it also offered to make slots available to IAG to run routes across the Irish Sea for the next three years.

None of it was enough to persuade the EU though, who will no doubt face a stiff and swift response through the appeal process over the coming months.
O'Leary is already the majority shareholder in Aer Lingus, and could potentially now be forced to sell its
ever-reducing stake in the airline. However, with the Ryanair CEO already on the offensive, it would take a brave
move from the European Commission to enforce such litigation at this moment in time.Published by HT

RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST: Political deadlock in Italy. The old austerity versus spending tug-of-war returns.
The EADS chief executive tells me tonight there's no room for mistakes when it comes to the A350. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TOM ENDERS, CEO, EADS: There is no such thing as schadenfreude on our side. We watch very closely what's happening at Boeing, and we are lucky enough that on that program, we are a good two years behind Boeing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
QUEST: And a fit of Pique. Barcelona football club is accused of spying on its star defender. I'm Richard Quest. We have an hour together, and I mean business.
Good evening. Italy's rival politicians are refusing to form a government and hurling gratuitous insults at one another. The ratings agencies are warning fiscal reform or Italy faces a downgrade. Whichever way you look at it tonight, it is a mess, and the country's austerity plans are suffocating in the political vacuum.

Join me at the CNN super screen and you'll see, though, the markets have shown tremendous resilience. You could call it a dead cat bounce, you could call it an overreaction. Whichever way you want to call it, Paris, for example, opened and had a nice climb towards the end, largely on the back of probably what was happening on Wall Street.

Probably, you'll see similar sort of movements on the Xetra DAX, all of them taking a cue from over the other side of the Atlantic. And also, very interested to see whether or not Italy managed to sell more than $5 billion worth of ten-year bonds.

Now, the yield was up 4.8 percent, but concern -- if you remember when it was up towards the 6 and 7 percent, which is generally thought to be the threshold of pain, things are considerably better, 4.8 percent is livable with for the time being.

Right now, the anti-austerity camps are holding most of the cards. We go to Rome. Becky Anderson is in Rome for us tonight. Good evening, Becky.

BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A very good evening to you. How would you describe Italy this evening? Well, you've put it pretty well. I'd say this is a state of political paralysis.

But then, some would say what is new? Sixty governments in sixty years, and they don't seem to be able to get it right today, nor have they got it very right in the past, Richard. You're absolutely right --
QUEST: Right.

ANDERSON: -- to say that this sort of wrangling over who does business with whom going forward, it's a mess. It's a nightmare here. You've got two parties, center-left and center-right. They are miles apart when it comes to the sort of policies going forward that they think they should pursue to get this economy back on track, 2.2 percent negative growth in 2012.


Page 54 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
I want to remind you here, that the per capita GDP growth here is no better today than it was back in 1999. Richard?

QUEST: Becky, as they come to try and put together a government, I know you're in Rome because, of course, Pope Benedict XVI resigns tomorrow. Is Italy -- which is it? Is it more transfixed with the goings on in the Vatican or in the presidential palace?

ANDERSON: This is a really interesting question, and I put this to somebody just yesterday, a professor from one of the universities. I said, it is remarkable that Italy sits on a sort of precipice, at the moment, of change both politically and, indeed, behind me here at Vatican City. And yet, Italians are quite sanguine about the whole thing.

And he put it this way. He said there is this sense of live and let live in Italy. And it, to a certain extent, comes from the faith here, the Roman Catholic faith that amongst all the change over the years, things will continue and life
will go on.

Now, that doesn't make things any easier for people who are living here through this transitional period, but I think there is that certain sense that whatever happens, same, same, but different, things will be OK in the end.

But at this point, you and I know that what happens here politically and economically doesn't just have an impact on Italians --
QUEST: Right.

ANDERSON: -- it has an impact on Europe, the European states, this is the third-biggest economy in the eurozone --
QUEST: Right.

ANDERSON: -- and eighth biggest economy in the world. And outside of the eurozone space, it has an effect on the global economy as well. So, as much as Italians are fairly, like I say, sanguine about what's going on, by no means am I suggesting that they don't want things to change, because they do.

QUEST: Becky Anderson in Rome tonight, and making the point perfectly that what's happening in Italy goes to the core at the moment of the European debate. Italian voters have resumed Europe's grand struggle. It is the tug-of-war between austerity on the one hand and government spending on the other.

Now, the Italian vote was largely regarded as an anti-austerity protest. We had Grillo winning a quarter of the vote, Monti was trounced.

But compare that with the UK. Even though fourth quarter growth still negative, the UK government still pulling towards austerity, and the British prime minister David Cameron attacked during prime minister's questions, but he says he's still firmly in the austerity camp.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DAVID CAMERON, PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN: The decision of the ratings agency is a reminder of the debt and the deficit problem that this country faces, and frankly, it is a warning to anyone who thinks we can walk away from it.

It is absolutely vital that we continue with the work of this government: that is cut the deficit by a quarter, that adds a million extra private sector jobs, and has interest rates at record low levels.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

QUEST: So, other countries -- Greek voters were caught between the two options. First of all, voters rejected austerity -- sorry, this way. They rejected austerity with Syriza. But then, they eventually said, no, we will have austerity in the re-election run. Voters in France rejected austerity. Francois Hollande said austerity was no longer inevitable.

And now we come to the biggest of all, the debate that's taking place in Washington. Which way is that going, between Republicans on austerity and Democrats on spending? Backwards and forwards this is going as they have to decide whether to have cuts.



Page 55 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Let's forward to Bronwyn Curtis, the senior advisor at HSBC investment banking arm. Bronwyn, who is winning the battle between austerity and spending at the moment, and is it important for economic growth?

BRONWYN CURTIS, SENIOR ADVISOR, HSBC INVESTMENT BANKING: It's really difficult in the West, so in Europe and the US, to know exactly what to do, because we have a budget in the UK, 20th of March, so just less than a month to go.

And what is George Osborne, the chancellor, going to do? He says he's going to stick to austerity now, but there will be pressure on him to take some of that off because the economy is just not growing.

QUEST: It's not growing, and voters in Italy have given their opinion. They don't want austerity, but at the same time, what's the best hope for Italy? That Mario Draghi eventually comes in and starts buying bonds?

CURTIS: No, I think that's probably not what you want, because always the threat of the European Central Bank coming in is better than actually the actuality. But I think in Italy -- look, they've always had weak governments, they've always had coalitions. So, in some ways, this isn't a surprise.

If you're sitting in Italy, are you going to vote for more austerity? Are you going to say I want to have spending cut?

QUEST: Then that means we do end up with this odd situation -- doesn't it? -- where the people are and have been -- Hollande in France, Greece, Italy -- the people are saying no more, and the politicians are continuing regardless.

CURTIS: Well, of course, if you're an economist, like me, what you would say is that you cannot let spending keep on going. You cannot let the debt situation spiral out of control, because you end up in an impossible situation, and you will have a much worse recession. So, it's getting that balance between austerity and spending right that's so difficult.

QUEST: The IMF late last year basically said there was too much austerity and it was killing the golden goose, or whatever, the goose that lays the golden egg. Do you think we've got the balance wrong and it needs to be readdressed?

CURTIS: I don't think we know. I think that's the problem. What we've seen is that on monetary policy, they've -- most countries, the rates are at zero in the Western world and they're doing quantitative easing and --
QUEST: And it's still not growing.

CURITS: And it's still not growing. Austerity alone works better if the rest of the world's growing, and that's not happening now because all of the countries in Europe and the US are doing austerity.

QUEST: Quickly and briefly as we come -- we must talk about the US. Which are you more worried about? The shenanigans in Rome and in Italy, or the forthcoming shenanigans over forced spending cuts and sequestration in the United States? Devil and the deep blue sea.

CURTIS: I think probably the US. It's a huge economy. If you have sequestration coming in, then it is a huge cut. It is one of the drivers of the world. It's not just China. You need the US more than you need Italy.
QUEST: Bronwyn Curtis, thank you for that. Many thanks, indeed.

Now, European markets enjoyed a strong session. We showed you the brief numbers a moment or two ago. This is a more considered look. The Xetra DAX, the Paris CAC 40 up 2 percent. That was the best of the day, but banking stocks, of course. On to the Dow Jones Industrials --
(RINGS BELL)
QUEST: -- and how the Dow's trading. It is -- oh, look at that! Bronwyn, that warms the -- why, Bronwyn? Why up
150 points on an average Wednesday when you've go the sequestration coming along?

CURTIS: Well, Ben Bernanke's been talking today, and he's calmed things down, everyone thinks it will be OK that they're not going to stop doing QE, that money will still be pumped in. And I think actually most people still think the Democrats and the Republicans will come to some agreement before sequestration kicks in.
QUEST: Over 14,000 on the Dow. Bronwyn, thank you very much, indeed.

QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. While Boeing's planes are grounded, the main rivals' profits are talking off. The chief executive of EADS next on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.
(RINGS BELL) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
QUEST: Airbus has warned that its A350 program is challenging, and there's no room left in the schedule for further problems. The Airbus owners, of course, are EADS, and the parent company took a charge of more than
$680 million.

Two problems that they had to fix. Firstly, the A380 wings, and secondly, the development of the 350. It was the black mark on an otherwise strong earnings report: profits up 19 percent, revenue's gained 15 percent. I asked EADS chief exec Tom Enders if the lack of wiggle room on the 350 was now posing a risk to those numbers.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ENDERS: It's our policy that we are very transparent with risks in the company. Investors -- this is why we were very blunt about the 350 program. But this is not meant to ring any alarm bell, it's just stating the obvious, where a program of that size, of that magnitude, the technological challenges that we have in this program is inherently risky, and that is what the statement is about.

QUEST: Fabrice Bregier told me that he was virtually personally overseeing the 350 project, at least from a -- to make sure it stays on track and doesn't become another fiasco -- a flight fiasco. I assume you're overseeing Fabrice Bregier to make sure that at some point you don't have to start answering questions about it.

ENDERS: Yes, Fabrice has been overseeing that program, has been very close to that program, since its very start in 2007. And I have to commend him on what he has achieved in terms of risk mitigation on that program, and I have every confidence in him knowing how to steer a program. We're on a good path here.

QUEST: Look, we've got to talk about the Dreamliner. It's not your plane, of course. You've decided you -- I love the phrase that you were quite open and honest about you decided to go for Plan B with nickel cadmium.

But you must now be also looking very closely at the certification process, because the FAA is questioning how the certification process of the 787 took place. You are about to go through the same process with the 350. It's going to be tougher.

ENDERS: Yes. You're absolutely right. The certification authorities will be more nervous about the certification also of our 350 after what they went through on the 787. So, there is no such thing as schadenfreude on our side.

We watch very closely what's happening at Boeing, and we are lucky enough that on that program, we are a good two years behind Boeing so that we have the chance to activate our Plan B, which is simply to protect the entry into service.
We spoke about risk just a minute ago. There are plenty of risks if you introduce a new aircraft, but those risks
that you can master, that you can mitigate, I think you should, and this is exactly what we've done with our battery
decision.

QUEST: As the CEO now of the parent group, EADS -- I looked at the numbers. Airbus commercial revenues are twice as much as everything else combined. If you -- the numbers are -- it's what? -- $38 billion, and the rest comes to barely $16 billion. So, if you take that as a starting point, how much is it your priority to rebalance EADS in the future, if you can?

ENDERS: Well, I'll tell you Richard, right now I'm pretty happy with the balance or the ratio that we have. I take note that our dear competitor in Chicago nowadays is advertising its growing dependence on commercial and is playing down the defense side.

So, the defense business in North America and Europe has fled. The commercial business is growing quite significantly. Not a bad position to be in, and -- then again, there's nothing magical about a 50/50 balance of something like that.

The good thing is, our defense business is rather stable. We have $12 billion revenues. That, by the way, makes us probably the second-largest if not the largest in terms of operations in Europe, European defense company.

Page 57 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So, not a small piece of business. We have a well-sorted portfolio in areas that matches the mission requirements of our customers. I'm not unhappy about the situation we're in.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

QUEST: Tom Enders who is the chief executive of EADS. Staying in the air, the European Commission has rejected Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus. It's the second time this has happened. The competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said he had no choice. In his words, the deal would have directly harmed passengers who would have had to pay higher results -- as a result, in his words.

Ryanair has made three bids for Aer Lingus and says the decision is manifestly unjust, describing it as politically inspired, pandering to the vested interests of the Irish government. Ryanair says it will appeal against the EU's decision.

And this is the problem as it relates to Ryanair and Aer Lingus: put simply, Aer Lingus is scratching around for a market, and Ryanair is the largest passenger airline in Europe. It is becoming increasingly more difficult for Aer Lingus to fight off other than by legal means and the protection of the Irish government and, of course, the European Commission.
But the Irish government wants out of Aer Lingus. Ryanair knows it only has to wait out and see its time, and Air
Lingus is running short of friends.

You might be tempted to say it's inevitable that Aer Lingus will eventually fall to Ryanair. Inevitable, perhaps not, but frankly, from whichever way you sit, and whichever way you look, most people in the industry say it's pretty likely.

Now to tonight's Currency Conundrum. There's at least one place in the world that still uses coins made from stone for certain transactions. Is it Turkmenistan, the Federated States of Micronesia, or Cameroon. Ooh, I like thins one. The answer later in the program.
Italy's bond sale boosted the euro, rising against the dollar. The yen's also higher. The pound -- (RINGS BELL)
QUEST: -- flat. Those are the rates, this is the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
QUEST: Pope Benedict XVI used his last public speech to talk about the sex scandals and corruption that have bedeviled his papacy. The pope said the Catholic Church had weathered the storms in the past and will not sink.

There were allegations of money laundering and a holy mess at the Vatican, all intensified since the pope's butler leaked secret papers last year. Jim Bittermann reports from Vatican City.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR EUROPEAN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As much as sexual scandals and innuendo have come to a boil in the last days of Pope Benedict XVI's reign, what is proving equally damaging to his legacy are the simmering stories of disarray, corruption, and infighting in the management of the Vatican. The pope himself has repeatedly over past months made references to it.

POPE BENEDICT XVI (through translator): The sins against the unity of the church, of the divisions in the body of the church, living Lent in a more intense and evident ecclesial communion, overcoming individualism and rivalry.

BITTERMANN: The secret documents leaked last year by the pope's butler, according to the reporter who first published them, painted a devastating picture of an isolated pope surrounded by members of the Italian curia who actively impeded his efforts, something that surprised the author.

GIANLUIGI NUZZI, AUTHOR (through translator): The pope's loneliness in front of what is happening in the Vatican. A pope that was alone and was left alone. A pope who was a great theologian but who hasn't succeeded in bringing forth his reforms in the battle for transparency.




Page 58 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BITTERMANN: In fact, Nuzzi, whose book is now coming out in English, entitled "Ratzinger Was Afraid," believes the butler took the risk of leaking the documents precisely because he believed making the public would help the pope in his battle to restore order.

BITTERMANN (on camera): According to Nuzzi, the corruption that the pope tried but failed to root out including kickbacks on government contracts, money laundering, and influence peddling among other things. And the author paints Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone as the villain in the piece.

BITTERMANN (voice-over): It was Bertone who very publicly heaped lavish praise on the departing pope at his last public mass, to which the pope dryly responded --
POPE BENEDICT XVI: Grazie. Torniamo preghiera.

BITTERMANN: "Thank you, and let's get back to prayer" Many of the accusations of mismanagement center around the Vatican bank, as they have for decades.

The bank, which is not a bank at all but a kind of wealth management fund, which oversees billions of dollars in investments, first attracted attention in the 1980s when an Italian banking official was found hanging from a bridge in London. It was classified a murder, but never solved.
The banker had done business with the Vatican institution, and is then director, American archbishop Paul
Marcinkus, who Italian police unsuccessfully tried to arrest. Eventually, he was forced to retire.
Last year, as the butler's stolen documents came to light, the bank's board of directors fired its president saying
he was not up to the job. Early this month, the pope named a replacement, but not until Italian banks, citing a lack
of transparency, cut of all services to the Vatican, including credit cards.

The problem, experts say, is that the Vatican is not subject to any financial controls other than those set by the Vatican itself, and author Nuzzi is convinced each time the pope tried to change the rules, his attempts were frustrated.

NUZZI (through translator): You can keep on believing in the fable that the pope has resigned because he is tired, but I don't believe it.
BITTERMANN: Jim Bittermann, CNN, the Vatican. (END VIDEOTAPE)
QUEST: As the pope prepares to step down tomorrow, join us for a closer look at nearly eight years, his resignation, his legacy as the Catholic Church moves forward. "Legacy of a Pope," it's on Thursday, it's at 10:30 in London, 6:30 in Hong Kong, and it is only on CNN.

Congress debates its own deal to avert spending cuts. They take place in 48 hours. We're in Washington after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. This is CNN, and on this network, the news will always come first.

Pope Benedict XVI is now less than 24 hours away from retirement, and around this time tomorrow, the pope will officially step down. He's now given his last weekly general audience at the Vatican. An estimated 150,000 people were there for this historic event.

In Egypt, mourners have gathered at the spot where a hot air balloon crashed on Tuesday, killing 19 people. Investigators say it appears the balloon was trying to land when someone from the ground crew tossed up a landing cable, which hit a gas line.

An employee has killed two people before shooting and killing himself at a lumber plant near the Swiss city of Lucerne. Police have told local media that seven people were hurt in the shooting, six of them seriously. The gunman had worked for the wood panel manufacturer for some time and his motives are unknown.

Scenes of heavy warfare are seen in the latest and newest amateur video from Syria. The description on the clip says it was taken today at Homs. On Thursday, more than 60 nations calling themselves the Friends of Syria will be meeting in Rome along with the Syrian opposition coalition.

And the US secretary of state John Kerry is in Rome for those talks. After meeting president -- the French president and the French foreign affairs minister in Paris. At a news conference, the secretary of state said France and the US are looking at ways to accelerate the political transition in Syria.

Look at the numbers and they tell an interesting story. The Dow Jones is over 14,000 at a gain of 162 points. This is a new intra-day five-year high. It's only about 100 points from the all-time record of 14,164.

Now you know, of course, there are just two days until billions of dollars in painful spending cuts, the so-called sequestration, automatic cuts. And no deal on the table, no congressional leaders have been invited to the White House on Friday. The president says they need to be ready to talk solutions. Jim Acosta, CNN's Jim Acosta, is at the White House.

Jim, we can leave the markets to one side. They seem to be on a perverse frolic of their own, bearing in mind what you're seeing on the political front.

JIM ACOSTA, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the political market is very different from the financial markets at this point, Richard.

I think you can probably bet the ranch at that point that this sequestration, as it's being called here in Washington, which may be as foreign a word to some of our viewers out there as it is to many Americans here in this country, but these forced budget cuts that go into effect Friday night at midnight, Eastern United States time, they are
going to happen, that the White House and congressional leaders at that point are essentially throwing up their hands, saying that they've been -- they're at an impasse and they've been unable to reach any kind of compromise that both Democrats and Republicans can accept.

Now we should mention, though, on Friday, the White House, the president has invited congressional leaders over here to the White House to try to talk about this. But, really, realistically speaking, that doesn't give anybody really any time to pass legislation to avoid this -- these forced budget cuts from happening.

And White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked about that earlier today at the White House briefing. Here's what he had to say.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We hope that Republican leaders will begin to respond to the will of the American people, that they will begin to respond to some of the concerns expressed by some members of Congress in the Republican Party, about the folly that allowing sequestration going into -- go into effect would represent.

You know, they're -- whether it's in Norfolk, Virginia, or Newport News, Virginia, or in some of the districts that Secretary Duncan discussed, or, you know, on the southwest border, the impacts of sequester will be onerous and severe. That was, after all, the purpose of designing this piece of legislation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

ACOSTA: Now you heard the press secretary mention a couple of things there. He said Newport News, Virginia; that was in reference to the president going down to the Tidewater area of Virginia to talk about how these cuts will affect the shipbuilding business for the defense industry, which is obviously a big part of the economy here, Richard.

And then also he talked about Secretary Duncan. That's the Secretary of Education here in the United States and Arne Duncan was at that press briefing and talked about how these budget cuts are going to be forcing him to lay off some teachers and closing of schools for certain days of the week.

And, Richard, he said -- just very quickly let me add this -- he said that's not what's happening in other parts of the world. That's not how other countries are dealing with their educational systems.

QUEST: Jim, if the sequestration -- or at least (inaudible) sequestration is the word that shall not be named, as they say, those four spending cuts -- I can't -- I can't spell it, so I shouldn't say it. Jim, if the -- if they start coming in, I know it's a rolling process. When will Americans start feeling the effect?
Page 60 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ACOSTA: Well, it depends on which department of the federal government we're talking about. I've heard this described as sort of a rolling brownout of spending, Richard. And so for people who are traveling at the airports and obviously this is going to be of interest to our international viewers, if they're coming into the United States, there may be longer lines at security checkpoints.

The Federal Aviation Administration has said that they may be cutting back on the number of air traffic controllers that they have in the control towers. They say that's not going to impact safety, but that will result in a slowdown in terms of how many planes can take off and land at any particular time. So that's one place where things might
start happening pretty quickly.

But the Secretary of Education, who was here at the White House earlier today said that there are some poorer school districts that are heavily reliant on federal spending, that they may have to start laying off teachers right away; they may have to cut down the school week to three or four days a week in order to pay for these budget cuts that are coming.
And so it may be -- it may be faster than some people think, Richard.

QUEST: So some people will be doing less work as the weekend comes along; Jim Acosta will be doing more work --
ACOSTA: Yes, that's right.
QUEST: -- grips -- as we get to grips with the forced spending cuts and the word that shall not be named. Jim, many thanks indeed at the White House.
Still ahead on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, they are battling the blizzards and the snow and yet the planes keep flying: a close-up on how one European airport fights off frost. Good evening to you.
(MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC PLAYING)
QUEST: We are on the cusp of a new golden age of luxury travel. That's not my view; it's the view of the chief executive of one of the world's biggest hotel groups, Starwood. And not only are we on that cusp, but that Dubai is at the center of that cusp. So eager is Starwood to tap into the market it's moving its global headquarters from New York to Dubai for the month of March.

It's not the first time they've done this. They did it in China, temporarily relocating to Shanghai in 2011 to make inroads. It's a symbolic but significant market move.

FRITS VAN PAASSCHEN, CEO, STARWOOD HOTELS AND RESORTS: Emerging markets for us today account for about 80 percent of the hotels that we plan to open over the next four years. Dubai's a great example of those new emerging travel patterns that are driving that. You see travel from China into Africa using Dubai as a hub; Southeast Asia into Europe.

So it's a very important and dynamic market for us. The other thing is by being based in Dubai, we can get to Africa, India and throughout the Middle East. So this is as much a regional relocation as it is a relocation just to Dubai.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

QUEST: You could almost hear Emirates in Dubai and Etihad in Abu Dhabi or indeed Qatar in Doha cheering at the move. Boeing is going to have to wait to get the Dreamliner 787 back in the air.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
QUEST (voice-over): The Federal Aviation Administration in America has denied reports that test flights of the
787 will begin as early as next week. It's grounded because of problems with the lithium ion batteries.

Boeing has put forward a containment plan using ceramic dividers to prevent thermal runaway spillover within the batteries. The FAA says it will not let that plane fly again until it is 1,000 percent sure that it is safe. We'll have a "Profitable Moment" on that subject at the end of the program.

Tonight in Oslo, there is fog. And the temperature has dropped to -3 degrees Celsius. But fret ye not if you're flying into and out of Oslo. The airport's taking it all in its stride. If you look here, Oslo is the world's expert in battling wild weather. This is the departure hall, live picture at the moment, from the airport.

If you look at the arrival and departure halls, you'll see that that all -- this is the new one, by the way, the new one is, again, over here -- everything is expanding. There's still some snow on the ground. But the departure hall itself, according to these latest pictures, everything's going very well.

Gardermoen, as the airport is known, is being regularly voted and elected Europe's most punctual airport, even though it gets up to six months of winter a year. So how do they keep things moving? Why aren't the people sleeping in tents at the airport? There was only one way to find out. I went to Gardermoen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (MUSIC PLAYING)
QUEST (voice-over): A synchronized dance on a challenging stage, elegant choreography, military timing. In just
15 minutes, a runway cleared of snow and (inaudible) the flight. This is Oslo airport's state-of-the-art fleet, 27
vehicles including two of the world's largest snowblowers.

HENNING BRATEBAEK, HEAD OF AIRPORT OPERATIONS, GARDERMOEN: We have two on the TV2000 (ph) and this one is the newest. It's (inaudible) yesterday.
QUEST: It's huge.
BRATEBAEK: Yes. Its weight, it's 40 tons.
QUEST (voice-over): Forty tons and more than a million dollars, and they're willing to let me have a go. QUEST: Now where's the start button?
(MUSIC PLAYING)

QUEST: You really feel this whole thing just moving in the snow and then suddenly slowing down, extraordinary. Keeping things moving whatever the weather.

QUEST (voice-over): In a climate that can be brutally unforgiving, this is one airport that can't afford to be beaten by snow.

NIC NILSEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GARDERMOEN AIRPORT: It is as easy as this: we have winters six months out of a year. And we need to be able to handle winter operations more or less like summer operations. It requires good planning, a lot of resources, good procedures and a lot of training.
QUEST (voice-over): The strategy is to keep one runway open at all times, whatever it takes.

QUEST: When your advisers and your staff come up to you and they say, we need another two machines, I'm guessing they don't have to push too hard before you sort of sign off on it?
NILSEN: That is being signed very, very quickly. We have the policy to have state-of-the-art equipment at all time. QUEST (voice-over): Putting winter maintenance first is an easy decision when snow is your norm. For those
airports where it's rare and doesn't drive policy, the consequences are all too familiar. This winter again, Europe
was hit with severe disruption.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And more delays, especially in Frankfurt.
QUEST (voice-over): And hundreds, in some cases thousands of flights were canceled at major hub airports. QUEST: In Europe, there's heavy falls of causing widespread travel delays.
QUEST (voice-over): Across the Atlantic, an ever-more dismal picture.
Page 62 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible) of destruction.
QUEST (voice-over): In October last year, Hurricane Sandy caused the loss of hundreds of lives. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ripping through this community --
QUEST (voice-over): Tens of billions of dollars' worth of damage. In February, the bad weather returned. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Going to have to deal with a nasty wintry weather.
QUEST (voice-over): With storms wreaking havoc over the Northeast. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: More than 5,000 flights canceled.
QUEST (voice-over): Grounding thousands of flights in one weekend. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Obama announced a state of emergency -- QUEST (voice-over): Here in Oslo, it's business as usual.
QUEST: When the bad weather starts and hits, are you in favor of airlines starting to cancel proactively? Because that will make it easier for you.

BRATEBAEK: Basically, yes. If they can't be proactive and cancel early, it's better for the airport. But it's also better for the passengers because then they know what to plan for.
(MUSIC PLAYING) (END VIDEO CLIP)
QUEST: One of the most amazing things that I've seen is the way that conga line of snowplows moves its way across the airport, perfect symmetry, absolutely extraordinary the way they keep them.

Snow on the runway, though, it is not going to be the problem for the chief executive of Oracle, the software company. Why?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

QUEST (voice-over): Larry Ellison bought a large chunk of a Hawaiian island last year and now he's just bought the airline Island Air to get to it. The billionaire purchased the regional carrier, has a staff of 250 or so, at an undisclosed price. He says he did it to ensure the safety and security and the integrity of the service to the islands.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
QUEST: He wants to ensure that people and tourists can get there and leave. I'm sure if I got there I'm not sure I'd want to leave.
Jenny Harrison's at the World Weather Center. Before we get to the serious stuff of the weather, your choice, Ms. Harrison, between the cold and the snow of Oslo or the beach and the sun -- remember, one's got skiing and its own charm -- or the beach and the sun of Hawaiian Islands?

JENNY HARRISON, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Never been to Hawaii, but I think I'd go for the snow. Now that I know that you would be there on hand to shift the stuff. I was very impressed with your snow clearing skills, Mr. Quest. I'm thinking we could ship you off to the U.S., actually, to help out in the Midwest. Yes? No.
QUEST: You're just -- you're just like -- you'd just like to see sit at the machine with a shovel, wouldn't you? HARRISON: I would.
QUEST: (Inaudible).
HARRISON: Yes, a bit more manual, actually. That was a bit too easy; you got to sit down in the warm.


Page 63 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Yes, you're right. The winter weather, of course, it's still that time of year across the Northern Hemisphere. And across the Plains and Midwest, this is the area that's been really impacted in the last few hours. Have a look at the pictures coming out of Wisconsin because this big blizzard, it passed through. It is continuing to work its way away from this particular region.

But guess what, of course, in the wake of a storm like this, obviously there are many homes still without power, roads are closed across certain areas of the state. And, yes, the portion of snow will continue to come down for a while longer and, in fact, officials are saying that at least three people have died in this recent blizzard.

Now in terms of where it's going next, I can show you that because it is very, very slow moving. So the Midwest, also Canada, you'll notice Toronto, Montreal, New York and Boston picking up more of it, sort of a rain and icy mix.

But the ground stops are still in place in New York, LaGuardia and JFK. Newark has got long delays, an hour and five minutes, and it's likely to stay like that, because as I say, it's a very, very slow moving system. So still some very heavy snow along the line of this system. The warnings are in place.

They've just been removed across the Midwest. So now we're looking at this little corner up and around Boston to the north of there. And the snow will continue to come down certainly in Ottawa, maybe another 30-plus centimeters in the next 48 hours.

But once it clears, it's a fairly compact -- and a few more showers, some mountain snow coming in towards the Pacific Northwest and eventually working its way down the line of the Rockies. So cold across the north, 1 in Chicago on Thursday, not bad in the South, plenty of sunshine, a little bit cool in Atlanta with a high of 9 degrees Celsius.

And then heading to the Southern Hemisphere, this is the story here. It's this cyclone Rusty. This has been making its way now onshore. It's finally made landfall. It's still having an impact across Western Australia, still a few days likely before the (inaudible) production and also the ports open fully for business once again.
And in fact, residents in this area have been told to stay indoors until at least Friday. Winds will diminish very,
very quickly. Gusty winds, really, for the most part, but look how gusty it was, Port Hedland, one of the main ports
there, 57 hours with gusts over 80 kph, Pardoo, a town close by, over an annual (inaudible) millimeters of rain
which is more than their annual total.

So the winds will soon diminish, but the rain will continue to work its way through Western Australia and you can see the accumulations of course, enough to cause some localized flooding. As for Europe, it's a fairly quiet picture.

Some good sunshine, some quite mild temperatures. It's just the southwest we're watching, Portugal and Spain, Spain in particular, we're going to see more scenes like this over the next few days as the next storm system works its way across that region. See, more snow for you, Richard; more snow for you to shovel. Should be a happy man.
QUEST: I'm going to Lapland in a couple of weeks. HARRISON: Oh, perfect.
QUEST: I'll have more -- I've had more snow in 2012-13 than I ever want to see. Jenny Harrison is at the World Weather Center. We thank you, Jenny. Many thanks.
An Australian billionaire -- maybe I'll buy Jenny a ticket on this next boat -- an Australian billionaire has unveiled his plans for a replica of the Titanic. Clive Palmer says he will be tempting fate to call it unsinkable. The ship's designer wanted to reassure potential passengers.

I can assure that, from the safety point of view, it will be absolutely the most safe cruise ship in the world when it's been launched.

QUEST: The most safe cruise ship -- sounds like a little bit like unsinkable. It'll set sail on 2016, on the trans-Atlantic route, for which its ill-fated predecessor took. There will be enough lifeboats on hand for any emergencies. The shipyard in China is in talks to build the luxury liner. And of course, it's celebrating its centennial this (inaudible) last year of the sinking of the Titanic.

In a moment, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, you and I continue. The home of one of the world's biggest football teams, and now an app maker and a spy or maybe not. I will explain all on the other side.
(MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC PLAYING) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
QUEST (voice-over): The "Currency Conundrum" answer: where is stone money still used for certain exchanges? The answer is the Federated States of Micronesia, on the island of Kosrae (ph). Stones are used for certain traditional transactions.

Giant stone wheels measure the hole in the resource so they could be transported with poles. Some of them are so big they have to remain where they are.
I suppose it stops people picking other people's pockets.

Keeping tabs on employees may be one thing. When they're the world famous footballer dating a pop star, it's a very different prospect. Barcelona has been accused of spying on the Spanish defender Gerard Pique whilst he was dating Shakira. The accusation comes from a -- how can you be -- how can you be spying on him when he's in all the newspapers?

According to a Spanish newspaper, former employees of a detective agency say the club asked them to track his movements. They were worried about the relationship's effect on his performance on the field. The club denies the allegations.

But again, what -- I mean, how -- the man's in every paparazzi picture. So I hardly see how -- anyway. It's not for me to worry down that particular road or, indeed, you.

If Barcelona's keeping tabs on its players, plenty of people are keeping tabs on the club itself. As the city's hosting the annual Mobile World Congress, Kristie Lu Stout has discovered the Catalan giants are not only on the field, they're champions of the app world.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR: This is one of the most famous arenas in all of sport, the home of FC Barcelona. The club has long been known for its success and its distinctive style of play. But it's also an innovator in the world of technology.

SANDRO ROSELL, FC BARCELONA PRESIDENT: It is crucial that we (inaudible) the future of new technologies and social media because it's the only way to go.

STOUT (voice-over): One way that Barcelona's reaching out to its fans is through mobile apps. But these apps on the official Barcelona page were not made by the club. They were created in partnership with independent app developers.

STOUT: The FGB Apps program is simple: developers can send in an idea for an app of iOS or Android. And if approved, they get official Barcelona branded. They could use the rich history and famous players of this massive football club and in return revenue is shared between the app developer and Barcelona.
(MUSIC PLAYING)

STOUT (voice-over): Getting ideas from developers outside the club also means Barcelona has a wider selection of apps than you'd expect.

DIDAC LEE, FC BARCELONA DIRECTOR OF TECHNOLOGY: One of them is a (inaudible) list app, is like some sort of personal trainer. I guess we will never have our own personal trainer app.

STOUT (voice-over): Apps in the program also benefit from promotion on Barcelona's social media accounts. Barcelona boasts that it has more followers than any other football club on social media. But the club's president says he wants to make sure that additional contact leads to a connection in the real world.

Page 65 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ROSELL: We have to do it very carefully because what we love is the daily contact with our fans, the human contact, to see the faces, to know who is who, to give (inaudible) to our members and that through a computer, this is not possible.

STOUT (voice-over): With nearly 60 billion followers on social media, it is a huge pool of new fans who attempt a visit to this famous stadium. As for why Barcelona has so many fans online? Well, the answer could be very simple.
LEE: Maybe because we have Messi on our team. (LAUGHTER)

QUEST: When we come back, there will be a "Profitable Moment" on the Dreamliner after the break. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.
(MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
QUEST: Tonight's "Profitable Moment," earlier on this program, you heard Tor Mendez (ph) of EADS Airbus say there was no schadenfreude at the issues of Boeing and its Dreamliner and for good cause. As I flew through Warsaw Airport this week, I saw this sad sight. Its lot, Polish Airlines.

It's a brand new Dreamliner. It's got the engine covers on. In other words, it's a new plane and it's going nowhere fast. It's not only locked in Poland, it is United Airlines over in Los Angeles, where I photographed this 787, just sitting there, waiting, costing money and making no revenue. For the airlines involved, it's very embarrassing.

They advertised they were the first European airlines flying the 787. They are not. They're flying nowhere. Grounded for five weeks since the battery failure. Boeing said it'll have a fix and hopes to get the planes in the air quickly. It won't. The airlines are now saying don't expect them to fly for many more weeks, in some cases, months.

And as for Airbus, tonight they made it quite clear they take no pleasure in this. They have their own 350. Time is tight. And certification will be more difficult. The Dreamliner is a warning of sleep for everyone.
And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I
hope it's profitable.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
QUEST (voice-over): The headlines at the top of the hour on CNN:

Pope Benedict XVI is now less than 24 hours away from retirement. About this time tomorrow, the pope will officially step down. He has given his last weekly general audience at the Vatican in front of an estimated 150,000 people who turned out for the historic event.

In Egypt, mourners gathered at the spot where a hot air balloon crashed on Tuesday. Nineteen people were killed. Investigators believe the balloon was trying to land when someone from the ground crew tossed up a landing cable which hit a gas line.

An employee has killed two people before shooting and killing himself at a lumber plant near the Swiss city of Lucerne. Police are telling local media that seven people were hurt in the shooting, six of them seriously. The gunman had worked for the wood panel manufacturer for quite some time. His motives are unknown.

Scenes of heavy warfare in the newest amateur video from Syria, a description of this clip says it was taken in Homs today. On Thursday, more than 60 nations calling themselves Friends of Syria will be meeting in Rome along with the Syrian Opposition Coalition, that meeting taking place in Rome.

EU's antitrust body blocks  Ryanair bid to take over rival Irish airline  Aer Lingus

BY JUERGEN BAETZ AP

27 February 2013

BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The European Union's antitrust authority on Wednesday blocked  Ryanair's renewed bid to take over rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus,  ruling that it would undermine competition and drive up ticket prices.

The merger of the two Dublin-based airlines would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on almost 50 routes where  Aer Lingus  and Ryanair currently compete, said the  EU Commission, the bloc's executive arm.

``This would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers travelling on these routes,'' it said, rejecting the remedies offered by Ryanair in return for a green light to its takeover bid.

Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline and already the biggest shareholder in Aer Lingus, vowed to appeal what it called a ``political decision'' designed to meet the interests of the Irish government. Its offer valued Aer Lingus at about (euro)700 million ($900 million).

``At a time when airlines in Europe and further afield are merging to form bigger competition champions ... the EU Commission has yet again set back competition and choice in Europe while delaying much-needed
consolidation,'' said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely.

The Irish government has opposed Ryanair ever since the airline surprised virtually everyone by launching its initial bid for Aer Lingus in 2006 just days after the government floated it on the British and Irish stock exchanges. Ireland retained a 25 per cent stake that it refused to sell to Ryanair.

So did Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts that own more than 10 per cent of shares. The unionized Aer Lingus work force views Ryanair with particular hostility because it refuses to recognize unions, and has a reputation for combative treatment of customers and employees alike.

Irish Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said a Ryanair-run Aer Lingus ``would have a significant detrimental effect on competition, connectivity and employment in the Irish market.''

The EU said both airlines combined would have controlled 87 per cent of all short-haul flights out of Dublin, creating a dominant position on 18 routes and an ``outright monopoly'' on 28 others.

``The acquisition raised very significant competition concerns since it would have eliminated Ryanair's strongest competitor,'' said EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia. ``In the end the most likely outcome of this transaction would have been quite simple: When flying to and from Ireland, passengers ... would have ended up paying higher prices.''

When Ryanair relaunched its takeover bid last year, it expressed hopes that Ireland would agree to sell its stake this time, given the fact that the debt-burdened government is seeking to sell billions in state assets as part of its effort to exit its 2010 international bailout. And Ryanair's detailed pitch to EU authorities included a framework agreement to sell key Aer Lingus routes to two British competitors, British Airways and Flybe.

Ryanair, which has surged ahead of Aer Lingus in Ireland with a larger work force and lower average fares, also promised to trim Aer Lingus ticket prices and increase employment while keeping Aer Lingus as a distinctive higher-service brand with trans-Atlantic routes. Ryanair operates only in Europe, Morocco and the Canary Islands.


Page 68 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
``We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically inspired prohibition,'' Kiely said.

The EU Commission has cleared other large airline mergers or takeovers, including the British Airways-Iberia and Lufthansa-Austrian Airlines deals. But Almunia told reporters that Ryanair's bid was different because the two airlines operate principally in the same market and are both based in Dublin. He compared the situation to a proposed merger between two Greece-based airlines, Olympic and Aegean, that the EU blocked in 2011.
Aer Lingus cheered the EU's decision.

``Aer Lingus' position from the outset has been that Ryanair's offer should never have been made,'' chief executive Christoph Mueller said in a statement.

The airline is suing Ryanair in an effort to force its rival to divest its 30 per cent stake. Britain's competition watchdog also is investigating whether Ryanair's investment in Aer Lingus unfairly influences its competitor's decisions. Ryanair holds no seats on the Aer Lingus board.

EU regulators thwart  Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus
329 words
27 February 2013

Deutsche Welle
DEUEN
English
(c) 2013. Deutsche Welle.
The EU Commission has foiled a third bid by budget carrier  Ryanair to take over its Irish rival  Aer Lingus,  citing monopoly concerns. Ryanair has slammed the ban as politically motivated and vowed to appeal the ruling.
The merger would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 46 routes, the  EU
Commission said in a statement released Wednesday.

In the opinion of the European Union's executive arm, Ryanair's takeover of its smaller Irish rival Aer Lingus would have reduced choice and most likely would have led to price hikes.

The decision came in spite of an improved remedies package from Ryanair, including divestitures on crossover routes, to allay regulators' concern of unfair competition.

Noting that he was generally in favor of industry consolidation, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said the remedies were simply inadequate to solve the very serious problems the acquisition would have created in the Irish aviation market.

In 2007, Ryanair failed for the first time to take control of Aer Lingus, which was followed by a second takeover bid in 2009 which the low-cost carrier withdrew when it became clear that Brussels was still opposed.
Ryanair vows to fight back

Following the decision, Ryanair said it would launch an appeal against the ruling, claiming it was politically motivated rather than based on competition concerns.
Ryanair's latest remedies package conclusively addressed all of the objections raised by the commission in its
2007 prohibition decision, and resolved all competition issues raised in its 2012 statement of objections, the
airline said in a statement Wednesday.

Ryanair already holds a 30-percent stake in Aer Lingus and offered to buy out the Irish government's 25.1 percent stake in July last year. However, Dublin has rejected the offer.
Aer Lingus welcomed the ruling by EU regulators, arguing it wanted to continue as a strong, standalone airline. uhe/dr (AFP, Reuters, dpa)

BRUSSELS--Budget carrier  Ryanair Holdings PLC said Wednesday it would appeal the decision by the European Union to block its acquisition of its Irish rival  Aer Lingus  Group PLC on the grounds that the merger would stifle competition.

Ryanair said it had offered an "unprecedented" package of concessions in its third attempt to merge with the carrier. It expressed confidence that it could overturn the decision when it filed the appeal to the EU's General Court in Luxembourg.
The European Commission, which acts as the EU's antitrust watchdog, said earlier Wednesday that it couldn't let
Ryanair's takeover bid go ahead, confirming officially what it had told the airline earlier this month.

The EUR694 million ($906.4 million) takeover would have created a monopoly on dozens of routes where Aer Lingus and Ryanair currently compete directly, and would have been to the detriment of some 11 million passengers traveling to and from Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Knock, the commission said.

"In the end, the most likely outcome of this transaction would have been quite simple. When flying to and from Ireland, passengers would not have been able to choose from as many options as they can today and they would have ended up paying higher fares," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told reporters in Brussels.

Remedies were "simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes," Mr. Almunia added.

Mr. Almunia rejected Ryanair's accusation that the decision had been driven by the "vested interests" of the Irish government, which holds a 25% stake in Aer Lingus and which had opposed the bid.

The decision had been based on "very, very solid analysis," both economic and legal, which had found that the market position of the two airlines on routes to and from Ireland was even stronger than in 2007, when Ryanair launched its first merger bid, he said.

Ryanair said it had already begun proceedings to overturn the decision, arguing that it had secured two upfront buyers, regional carrier Flybe Group PLC and British Airways, owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group, for each of the 46 crossover routes, along with other measures that had comprehensively addressed all outstanding antitrust issues cited by regulators.

"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically inspired prohibition," said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely in a statement. "Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal against this manifestly unjust prohibition."

The case will now have to be referred to the EU's General Court in Luxembourg within the next two months, though a decision there would likely take upward of nine months, possibly much longer. The court upheld the commission's 2007 prohibition.

In its latest package of concessions offer, Ryanair said Flybe would have taken over 43 Aer Lingus routes, guaranteeing EUR20 million in annual profit as well as a EUR100 million upfront payment for Flybe.

The aim was to convince the commission that Flybe was a credible competitor to Ryanair despite several profit warnings over the past two years and the announcement of cuts to its U.K. workforce last month.

Ryanair had also proposed transferring all of Aer Lingus's routes between London Gatwick and Ireland to British
Airways.

"The decision doesn't come as a huge surprise, the bid did seem to be a long shot to independent observers," said Antonio Bavasso, a partner at London-based law firm Allen & Overy LLP. "Was Flybe really there to free ride and to be sponsored by Ryanair? Those are legitimate questions for the commission to be asking."

Bruce Kilpatrick, competition partner at Addleshaw Goddard, said: "The Commission's findings that Flybe is not a suitable purchaser capable of competing sufficiently with Aer Lingus and Ryanair and that IAG/BA has little incentive to stay operating the routes beyond an initial three year period will be key to the appeal."

Aer Lingus Chief Executive Christoph Mueller said the "inadequate" concessions presented by Ryanair showed it had made its offer "without any reasonable belief that it could obtain clearance."

EU Blocks  Ryanair Bid for Aer Lingus

BRUSSELS--European Union regulators Wednesday blocked the latest bid by budget carrier  Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.LN) to buy its Irish rival  Aer Lingus  Group PLC (EIL1.DB), amid concerns that the merger would stifle competition and harm consumers.
The European Commission has already notified the discount carrier earlier this month that it intended to block the
694 million euro ($930.3 million) takeover, its third attempt at a merger. In a statement, the commission, which
acts as the EU's antitrust watchdog, said the merger would have created a monopoly on dozens of routes in and
out of Ireland where  Aer Lingus  and Ryanair currently compete directly.

"The Commission's decision protects more than 11 million Irish and European passengers who travel each year to and from Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon. For them, the acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a statement. He said the remedies were "simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes."

The commission, the EU's executive body, threw out an earlier merger bid in 2007, saying a merger would create a monopoly of Irish flights.

Ryanair immediately lashed back, blasting the decision as "political" and vowing to appeal. It said it has offered a "historic and unprecendented" remedies package and that its efforts to get regulators' backing had been thwarted by the "vested interests" of the Irish government, which holds a 25% stake in Aer Lingus. The government had opposed the bid. Ryanair currently holds 29.8% in Aer Lingus.

In a statement, Ryanair said its latest package of concessions, submitted earlier this month, had resolved all the competition issues raised by the commission.

"Ryanair delivered a structural divestment remedy including, not one, but two upfront buyers, irrevocable and binding commitments from those two upfront buyers, divestiture of Aer Lingus' flights in each of the 46 crossover routes, together with offers of slot divestiture for an unlimited period of time on all other potential competition routes," it said.

The case will now have to be referred to the EU's General Court in Luxembourg within the next two months, though a decision there would likely take upwards of nine months, possibly much longer.

In its later offer, Ryanair said regional carrier Flybe Group PLC (FLYB.LN) would have taken over 43 Aer Lingus routes, guaranteeing EUR20 million in annual profit as well as a EUR100 million upfront payment for Flybe. The aim was to convince the commission that Flybe was a credible competitor to Ryanair, despite issuing several profit warnings over the past two years and announcing cuts to its U.K. workforce last month.

Ryanair had also proposed transferring all of Aer Lingus's routes between London Gatwick and Ireland to British Airways, a unit of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, or IAG (IAG.MC). Under the previous package, British Airways would instead have received the routes between London Heathrow and Ireland.

The commission, however, said after a long assessment of those measures, major concerns remained. Chief among them was the proposed merger would have created an outright monopoly on 28 routes, while reducing competition on a further 11 routes.

"The decision doesn't come as a huge surprise, the bid did seem to be a long shot to independent observers," said Antonio Bavasso, a partner at London-based law firm Allen & Overy LLP. "Was Flybe really there to free ride and to be sponsored by Ryanair, those are legitimate questions for the commission to be asking."

More broadly, there had also been concerns that Flybe can't become a credible rival, as the regional carrier operates mainly smaller aircraft and, unlike Aer Lingus, operates under a very different business model

Earlier this month, Aer Lingus Chief Executive Christoph Mueller in an interview described Ryanair's package of concessions "very, very flawed."

Brussels (dpa) - The  European Union has blocked Irish low-cost airline  Ryanair from taking over  Aer Lingus, the EU executive said Wednesday, citing competition concerns.

The merger would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or market dominance on 46 routes currently contested by the two airlines, the  European Commission found.

"This would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers travelling on these routes," the commission found.

"The Commission's decision protects more than 11 million Irish and European passengers who travel each year to and from (the Irish cities of) Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

Ryanair had sought to address EU competition concerns by offering to sell parts of its short-haul business to rivals such as Britain's Flybe, as well as giving up take-off and landing slots at London airports, but failed to convince the EU's antitrust regulator.

"Those proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes," Almunia said.

The bid was thought to be worth around 700 million euros (915 million dollars). Ryanair already holds almost 30 per cent of shares in Aer Lingus.

The low-cost airline previously said it would take the issue to the European Court of Justice, should the merger be rejected.

Ryanair has twice before tried to acquire Aer Lingus. The first attempt in 2007 was blocked by the EU, also over competition concerns, and Ryanair itself abandoned the second attempt in 2009. dpa amh hm fxz Author: Helen Maguire

Ryanair had sought to address EU competition concerns by offering to sell parts of its short-haul business to rivals such as Britain's Flybe, as well as giving up take-off and landing slots at London airports, but failed to convince the EU's antitrust regulator.

"Those proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes," Almunia said.

The commission rejected the concessions in part because it found that Flybe would probably not have the resources to maintain a rival network over the long term.
Ryanair already holds almost 30 per cent of shares in Aer Lingus.

Aer Lingus welcomed the decision, saying: "Business and leisure travellers are well served by the vigorous competition that has been preserved between these two carriers."
But Ryanair said it would take the issue to the European Court of Justice. The carrier issued a statement
accusing the commission of a "'political' decision to pander to the vested interests of the Irish government," which
has a 25-per-cent share in Aer Lingus.

The ruling was "not ... based on a fair and reasonable application of EU competition rules or precedent airline merger approvals," the low-cost carrier wrote.

Ryanair has twice before tried to acquire Aer Lingus. The first attempt in 2007 was blocked by the EU, also over competition concerns. Ryanair itself abandoned the second attempt in 2009. dpa amh hm fxz ncs Author: Helen Maguire

Commission grounds Ryanair-Aer  Lingus  merger

EU antitrust regulators blocked  Ryanair's third attempt to acquire Irish rival  Aer Lingus  on Wednesday (27
February), a ruling  Europe's biggest low-cost airline called politically motivated and vowed to challenge in court.

The European Commission, which vetoed  Ryanair's first takeover bid for  Aer Lingus  in 2007, said the no-frills carrier had not offered sufficient concessions to allay concerns about the merged company's dominance or monopoly on 46 routes.
It said the €694-million bid could hurt competition and lead to higher prices for passengers.

"For [Irish and European passengers], the acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said in a  statement.

"Those proposals [from Ryanair] were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes," he said. The two airlines currently compete on these routes.
The EU antitrust authority said Ryanair's deals to divest some of Aer Lingus' routes to British airline Flybe and
British Airways would not have ensured sufficient competition.

Ryanair rejected the Commission's arguments, saying it had proposed an unprecedented and revolutionary package of concessions to allay regulatory concerns.

"We believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition," Ryanair said in a statement.

"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns ... Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal."

Ryanair's (RYAAY) bid to take over  Aer Lingus  has been blocked by the  EU's antitrust authority, the Associated Press reports. The  EU Commission says the merger would have created a monopoly or dominant position on almost 50 routes where the airlines currently compete.

Ryanair to Appeal EC Prohibition of Aer Lingus  Acquisition

NEWTOWN, Conn. -  Ryanair intends to appeal the recent decision of the  European Commission (EC) to prohibit the carrier's latest offer to acquire  Aer Lingus.  The EC believes that the acquisition, which would have combined the two leading Irish airlines, would result in higher fares for passengers. The  EC found that the acquisition would lead to a monopoly on 28 routes, and cause other significant competitive concerns on an additional 18 routes.

Ryanair had attempted to pre-empt these concerns by committing to transfer  Aer Lingus  operations to Flybe on
43 of the routes, and  Aer Lingus  flights and slots to British Airways/IAG on the remaining three routes. The  EC
found these proposed remedies to be insufficient. The agency was not convinced that Flybe would have the
experience and ability to maintain and develop the business as viable competition to  Ryanair. It also believed it
unlikely that Flybe would operate the routes on a lasting basis.

In addition, the EC felt that the transfer of slots on three routes to British Airways/IAG was not sufficient to prevent establishment of a dominant position on these routes by Ryanair. The agency also believed that it could not exclude the possibility that British Airways/IAG would eventually exit or scale back operations on the routes.

In announcing its intention to appeal, Ryanair said that the EC decision is a "political" decision to pander to the vested interests of the Irish government, which holds a 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus, and is not based on a fair and reasonable application of EU competition rules or precedents. In 2007, the EC had blocked an earlier bid by Ryanair to acquire Aer Lingus. In 2008, Ryanair attempted a second takeover bid of its Irish competitor, but later voluntarily withdrew the offer.
Ryanair currently holds a 30 percent stake in Aer Lingus. Document FORCST0020130228e92r0000r

SHOT DOWN: The  European Union's antitrust authority blocked  Ryanair's renewed bid to take over rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus,  ruling it would undermine competition and drive up ticket prices.

PLAYING MONOPOLY: The  EU Commission said the merger of the two airlines would have created a monopoly or dominant position on almost 50 routes where  Aer Lingus  and Ryanair currently compete.

HIGH HOPES: Ryanair hoped Ireland would sell its stake in Aer Lingus, since the debt-burdened government is seeking to sell billions in state assets as part of its effort to exit a 2010 international bailout.

Europe's low cost airline, Ryanair Holdings has said that the company is planning to file an appeal against the decision by the European Commission (EC) to block a proposed deal byteh company to acquire its Irish peer, Aer Lingus.

This week, the  EC announced its decision to block the deal for the second time. The  European Commission had issued formal objections to a new deal by  Ryanair to takeover Aer Lingus  alleging that the combining of the two Dublin based carriers would impact competition climate. Ryanair also said that it was informed by the  European Commission that the 694 million takeover proposal is not likely to be approved.

Aer Lingus and Ryanair, both believe that the deal is unlikely to be approved by the European regulators. Ryanair has assured European regulators that there are radical remedies to address the concerns relating to lower competition. On the other hand, Aer Lingus indicated that the deal is headed for a failure. Ryanair already owns
30 percent of Aer Lingus.
EU's competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said that the decision to block the takeover "protects more than
11 million Irish and European passengers who travel each year to and from Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon."

Tesco would buy more meat from its home market as part of its response to the discovery of horsemeat in beef products that had shaken consumer trust in supermarket supply chains, Britain's biggest retailer said yesterday. "We're going to bring meat production a bit closer to home. We do buy some, particularly for our frozen products, out of Europe, and as we can we'll bring it closer to home," chief executive Philip Clarke told the BBC's Today radio programme. Clarke said Tesco would seek more collaboration and partnerships with British farmers. He said that from July all chicken sold at Tesco's UK stores would come from British farms. - Reuters

Ryanair has vowed to fight in court a rejection by  European officials of its renewed takeover bid for Irish rival  Aer
Lingus,  branding the ruling politically motivated.

The low-cost carrier said the takeover bid, rejected yesterday by the  European Commission, was supported by a historic and unprecedented remedies package.

The "radical" bid included two upfront buyers - BA/IAG and Flybe - to take over around half of Aer Lingus's short-haul business.

Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said: "We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition."

The EC, which vetoed Ryanair's first takeover bid for Aer Lingus in 2007, said the budget airline had not offered sufficient concessions to allay concerns about the combined group' dominance or monopoly on 46 routes.

It claimed the bid - opposed by the Irish government - could hurt competition and lead to more than 11 million passengers paying more.

European commissioner for competition Joaquin Almunia said: "For [Irish and European passengers], the acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares."

Ryanair submitted its final package of takeover plans and commitments earlier this month following a series of meetings with European chiefs.
It said the package addressed the shortcomings in its previous two failed bids in 2007 and 2012.

Flybe, run by Scots-born executive chairman Jim French, had agreed to fly a number of Aer Lingus's short-haul routes.

RYANAIR has vowed to fight in court a rejection by  European officials of its renewed takeover bid for rival  Aer      Lingus.

The airline accused the  European Commission of acting unfairly and failing to apply its own competition rules and precedents to the latest takeover plan.

The takeover plan appeared to have been boosted earlier this month when Flybe agreed to fly 43 of Aer Lingus's short-haul routes, easing competition concerns.

There had also been a commitment from the IAG airline group to run overlapping Aer Lingus/Ryanair routes between Dublin and London Gatwick to ensure competition.

Ryanair said the EC's decision to block its latest bid was a political one to protect the interests of the Irish government which has a 25% share in Aer Lingus.

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair will appeal the decision of the  European Commission (EC) to block once again its takeover bid for Irish peer Aer Lingus.
According to  Ryanair the ruling is politically motivated.

Yet, the anti-trust authority said a possible buyout would hurt market competition since the carriers' cumulative share on the short-haul routes from Dublin will amount to 87% and eventually may lead to higher ticket prices.
For its part, Aer Lingus hailed the EC ruling reminding that the deal is the first transaction to be blocked twice. Abstracted from an original article in La Tribune (Ryanair n'a pas le droit de grossir : l'acquisition d'Aer Lingus

"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically inspired prohibition," said a  Ryanair spokesman. "Accordingly,  Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal against this manifestly unjust prohibition."
The airline said the bid rejected yesterday by the EU, was supported by an unprecedented remedies package.
The "radical" bid included two buyers - British Airways and Flybe - agreeing to take over about half of Aer Lingus's
short-haul business, easing competition concerns.

Ryanair said the decision to block its latest bid was a political one to protect the interests of the Irish government, which holds a 25% stake in Aer Lingus. The airline submitted its final package this month following meetings with EU chiefs. It said the package addressed the shortcomings in its two failed bids. PA

Flybe prospect seemed too good to be true - and it was

FLYBE boss Jim French might not be crying into his teacup after the  European Commission blocked the  Ryanair
bid, but he's no doubt disappointed that the spin of the roulette wheel didn't deliver.

Ryanair's major remedy to curry favour in Brussels for its  Aer Lingus  attempt involved serving up half its smaller rival's short-haul routes on a silver platter to Flybe.

Just to make it truly delectable, Ryanair was also handing over €100m in cash and another €50m in advance ticket sales to Flybe. It seemed too good to be true. And it was. "Flybe is disappointed by the Commission's announcement and remains firmly of the view that the proposed remedy would have afforded credible and robust competition, including new jobs and bases in Ireland," it said in a statement yesterday.

It must sting a bit that Brussels was so dismissive of Flybe and its potential capacity to compete against Ryanair. Even with the mountain of cash Ryanair was offering Flybe, the Commission said that it didn't think Flybe had the financial resources necessary "to maintain and develop Flybe Ireland as a viable and active competitor".
Perhaps French found some solace in the fact that his native Scotland beat Ireland in the rugby at the weekend. Document IINM000020130228e92s0000m

Mammoth task ahead for carrier as overturning rulings rare in EU; ANALYSIS

THE scale of the challenge facing  Ryanair in appealing the  European Commission's decision to block its bid can't be understated.

The carrier's first bid to buy Aer Lingus  was rebuffed by the Commission and so too was the subsequent 2007 appeal to the General Court of the European Union in Luxembourg. It denied  Ryanair's appeal in 2010, but also said at the time that  Ryanair couldn't be forced to sell its  Aer Lingus  stake.
If Ryanair's latest planned appeal proves successful, it would be the first time in more than a decade that an EU
anti-competitive ruling has been overturned. The fresh appeal would, as with the first one, take years.
It would also likely scare off other strategic investors and stymie the Irish Government''s efforts to offload its own
25.1pc - part of a package of privatisations required by its €85bn EUIMF bailout.

"The Government and Aer Lingus will simply have to wait and see what Ryanair chooses to do," said analyst David Holohan at brokerage Merrion Capital. "Until the Ryanair process is completed, I think the Government will struggle to find a buyer."

A €700m-plus pension deficit that serves Aer Lingus and DAA workers is also another possible spanner in the works.

Until it's resolved with unions, the government stake - and interest from any other potential Aer Lingus suitor - remains firmly in limbo.

Michael O'Leary has already said he would consider selling the Aer Lingus stake if the latest bid was blocked. Ryanair could target institutional investors keen to get exposure to one of Europe''s few profitable airlines and sell its stake that way.

Aer Lingus made a €69.1m operating profit last year, up 41pc on 2011, but costcutting and savings rather than any real growth have been key to improving the bottom line.

Dropping Ryanair would also clear the way for a large industry investor with deep pockets, like minority shareholder Etihad, or boost the company''s "free float" of readily tradeable shares, which Aer Lingus believes would help lift its share price.
Aer Lingus''s best hope of ridding Ryanair from its share register may be a probe by Britain''s Competition
Commission into whether the Ryanair holding distorts competition in the UK market.

The investigation has been delayed by the European probe and even if it is restarted, Ryanair could likely use appeal processes to delay a final decision for more than a year.

Ryanair says it will appeal as latest bid to buy Aer Lingus  fails

RYANAIR said it will appeal the  European Commission's (EC) decision to block the takeover of  Aer Lingus, prompting fears of a protracted legal dispute that could distract the two airlines for years.

Ryanair's bid to buy  Aer Lingus  was formally blocked for a second time by the  EC yesterday.

The commission said consumers would pay higher fares, routes would be monopolised and "vibrant" competition would be damaged in the Irish market if the takeover went ahead.
It's the first time the EU has rejected the same planned takeover twice.

Ryanair - headed by Michael O'Leary - said it would appeal a decision it claims was "manifestly motivated by narrow political interests".

That appeal process is likely to run for years. But in the meantime, a UK competition probe could result in Ryanair being forced to sell some or all of its 29.8pc stake in Aer Lingus.

The appeal could also derail a plan by the Government to sell its 25.1pc stake in Aer Lingus, at least in the short-term.

The EU's competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said that the decision to block the takeover "protects more than 11 million Irish and European passengers who travel each year to and from Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon."

He said a takeover would "most likely" have led to higher fares adding: "During the procedure, Ryanair had many opportunities to offer remedies and to improve them.

Inadequate "However, those proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes."
Ryanair launched its third bid for Aer Lingus last summer. It valued the former flag carrier at €694m.
Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller welcomed the EU's decision.
"Aer Lingus''s position from the outset has been that Ryanair''s offer should never have been made," he said. Ryanair had offered two significant remedies to the European Commission in an effort to allay competition fears. Those proposed remedies included a plan to hand over 43 Aer Lingus short-haul routes - about half the total - to
UK carrier Flybe.

Ryanair had intended to give Flybe €100m in cash and another €50m in ticket-sale revenue to consummate the deal.

Ryanair had also pledged to hand over take-off and landing slots at Gatwick and Heathrow airports to British Airways so it could operate additional services to Dublin, Shannon and Cork. Flybe and British Airways had committed to operate the services for three years.

But the commission said that Flybe "does not appear to have the proven relevant experience to maintain and develop Flybe Ireland as a viable and active competitive force".
It added that British Airways would have "little incentive" to stay on the routes beyond a three-year period. Document IINM000020130228e92s0001l

CONSUMERS would pay higher fares and suffer from reduced competition if  Ryanair was allowed to buy  Aer       Lingus,  European Commission watchdogs have said.

The EC's Competition Commission yesterday shot down Michael O'Leary's third attempt to buy  Aer Lingus, paving the way for an appeal that could last years.
Ryanair, which already owns 29.8pc of its rival, launched a scathing attack on the commission after it blocked its
€694m takeover attempt and confirmed its intention to appeal.

"The history of the EU''s treatment of Ryanair''s two offers for Aer Lingus conclusively proves that this prohibition is a 'political' decision to pander to the vested interests of the Irish Government," it said.

"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns," it added.
Transport Minister Leo Varadkar yesterday welcomed the EU decision.

"This decision supports the Government's view that a merger would be bad for competition in the Irish aviation market," he said.

E.U. bars attempt to buy Aer Lingus; Concerns  on competition derail 3rd bid by Ryanair to acquire its
Irish rival

The European Commission on Wednesday blocked the third attempt by  Ryanair to acquire Aer Lingus,  saying a union of the two Irish airlines would damage competition and raise prices on flights serving Ireland.

The decision was widely expected after  Ryanair, the largest budget carrier in  Europe, said this month that the commission would prohibit the €700 million, or $900 million, deal.

Joaquín Almunia said he blocked the acquisition to ensure adequate competition on routes serving Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon that are flown by 11 million passengers each year.

‘‘Currently these two airlines are competing head to head,’’ Mr. Almunia said. ‘‘Remedying problems of such magnitude would have required a countervailing force capable to be a strong and viable competitor to Ryanair — precisely the kind of competitor that Aer Lingus is today.’’
Aer Lingus, which had rejected Ryanair’s offers, said Wednesday that it welcomed the commission’s decision.
‘‘Aer Lingus’ position from the outset has been that Ryanair’s offer should never have been made,’’ said Christoph
Mueller, chief executive of Aer Lingus.

Ryanair, which already owns about 30 percent of Aer Lingus, reiterated that it would appeal the decision to the bloc’s second-highest tribunal, the General Court of the European Court of Justice.

Ryanair accused Mr. Almunia of protecting Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, against a takeover by an upstart. The company also contended that the regulator applied a double standard because he approved the takeover by British Airways and Iberia of British Midland International last year.

‘‘We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns, and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealingand overturning this politically inspired prohibition,’’ said Robin Kiely, a spokesman for Ryanair.

Various companies successfully appealed a string of blocked mergers a decade ago to what was then called the Court of First Instance, which found flaws in the reasoning of commission officials. But competition experts in Brussels said that such mistakes were highly unlikely in the case concerning Ryanair.

‘‘Companies that claim that merger decisions that don’t go their way are political are wasting their time,’’ said Fiona Carlin, the head of the competition practice at Baker & McKenzie in Brussels. ‘‘The commission has become increasingly careful about going the full mile in difficult cases in view of appeals.’’

Prolonged litigation could have wider ramifications, making it more difficult for the Irish government to sell its 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus. Ireland agreed to sell that stake under the terms of an international bailout finalized in November 2010, although that agreement did not set a deadline for the sale.

The deal is the fourth Mr. Almunia has blocked since taking over as the bloc’s antitrust chief in February 2010. Last month, the commission thwarted the attempt by U.P.S. to buy TNT Express.

The decision Wednesday was the latest chapter in years of acrimony between the commission and Ryanair’s pugnacious chief executive, Michael K. O’Leary, who has repeatedly criticized commission officials for decisions that curtailed his ambitions.

The enmity between Mr. O’Leary and the commission developed during the past decade as the two sides battled over whether Ryanair received illegal state subsidies that enabled the airline to open up routes to regional airports. Those airports were often some distance from major transport hubs, but still close enough to lure passengers away from more established carriers.
Last year, the commission announced new investigations into the effect of discounts Ryanair had received at
Lübeck-Blankensee Airport in Germany and the Klagenfurt regional airport in Austria.

Mr. O’Leary has sharply criticized the commission for not saving money by booking its officials on low-cost airlines like his own. Ryanair also has said its arrangements with all European Union airports comply with the bloc’s competition rules.

The competition authority blocked Ryanair’s first bid for Aer Lingus in 2007 on the grounds that the combined airline would have had a monopoly on too many routes. At the time, Mr. O’Leary accused the commission of bowing to political pressure from the Irish government, which opposed the deal. The airline abandoned a second attempt in 2009 because of opposition from the Irish government.

On Wednesday, Ryanair accused the commission of holding it to a higher standard than other airlines seeking mergers after it had offered ‘‘historic and unprecedented’’ concessions.

Among other items, Ryanair had offered to allow two competing airlines to serve Dublin, Cork and Shannon; to give those airlines more than half of the short-distance business belonging to Aer Lingus; and to agree to transfer airport slots in Britain, allowing British Airways to serve Ireland from both Gatwick and Heathrow. Ryanair also
had offered Flybe, a competitor, €100 million in financing to make it ‘‘a commercially profitable and viable entity’’
in Ireland.
On Wednesday, Mr. Almunia insisted that there had been no double standard.

‘‘We have followed exactly the same approach as we did in all these previous cases’’ involving assessments of tie-ups between airlines, Mr. Almunia said.

Mr. Almunia acknowledged that final approval for decisions to block mergers are taken by a commission of political appointees, each representing one of the Union’s 27 member states. But he said that such decisions were ‘‘based on a very, very profound, sound, sensible and detailed legal and economic analysis.’’

The commission said that Ryanair and Aer Lingus had strengthened their positions in the Irish market since the commission refused the previous deal in 2007, and that the merger would have created an ‘‘outright monopoly’’ on 28 short-distance routes serving Ireland.
The commission also said the barriers to entering the Irish market were too high for potential competitors.

The commission’s ‘‘market investigation showed that there was no prospect that any new carrier would enter the Irish market after the merger, in particular by the creation of a base at the relevant Irish airports, and challenge the new entity on a sufficient scale,’’ it said in a statement. ‘‘Higher prices for passengers would have been the likely outcome.’’

The commission’s decision was expected to revive a 2012 inquiry by a British competition watchdog into whether Ryanair’s stake in Aer Lingus gave it unfair influence over Aer Lingus’s business and strategy. The investigation, opened in June, was suspended after Ryanair announced its latest takeover offer.

Rory Taylor, a spokesman for the Competition Commission in Britain, said Wednesday that the regulator expected to restart its investigation ‘’shortly,’’ with an eye to concluding its work in the summer.

Commission tells O'Leary: hands off Aer Lingus

RYANAIR has lost its third bid to take over rival Aer Lingus  in a €700million deal after the deal was blocked by Europe's competition watchdogs. The European Commission said the merger would have created a monopoly of flights in and out of Ireland and would push up fares.

Michael O'Leary's airline was furious and vowed to appeal but  Aer Lingus  and Government ministers hailed the ruling.

EU competition chief Joaquin Almunia said: 'The acquisition raised very significant competition concerns since it would have eliminated Ryanair's strongest competitor.

'In the end the most likely outcome of this transaction would have been quite simple: When flying to and from Ireland, passengers... would have ended up paying higher prices.' Ryanair and Aer Lingus compete on 46 routes, with most of these in and out of Ireland. The EC said both airlines combined would have controlled 87 per cent of all short-haul flights out of Dublin, creating a dominant position on 18 routes and an 'outright monopoly' on 28 others.

'This [takeover] would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers travelling on these routes,' said a spokesman for the European Commission. Ryanair, which owns almost 30 per cent of Aer Lingus, had hoped the Government would consider selling its 25 per cent shareholding as the State sought to reduce the national debt burden. The airline also hoped the EC would have been satisfied after offering a series of concessions, known as remedies, to address competition fears.

Ryanair pledged to sell key Aer Lingus routes to two British-based competitors, British Airways and Flybe as part of the package of remedies.

Leo Varadkar welcomed the block on the takeover, insisting Ryanair's proposals to address competition concerns did not go far enough.

The tourism and transport minister said: 'The Government's strongly held view is that a takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have a significant detrimental effect on competition, connectivity and employment in the Irish market.

'Similar to my own view, the Commission considered the remedies proposed by Ryanair were insufficient to address the competition concerns.' The Government has indicated it will sell its €140million worth of shares in Aer Lingus this year but if Ryanair decides to appeal the Commission's takeover decision then the sell-off could be delayed.
Ryanair branded the EC's ruling a 'political decision' carried out to meet the interests of the Irish government. Spokesman Robin Kiely said: 'At a time when airlines in Europe and further afield are merging to form bigger
competition champions... the EU Commission has yet again set back competition and choice in Europe while
delaying much-needed consolidation.

'We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than compe-tition concerns. We believe we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically inspired prohibition.'

Takeover bid faced with impossible headwinds
901 words
28 February 2013
The Irish Examiner

English

Ryanair’s failed third bid to take over  Aer Lingus  begs the question whether the move would be allowed under any circumstances.
The European Commission gave detailed reasons on why it has come out against this latest attempt by  Ryanair
to subsume Aer Lingus.

Ryanair and chief executive Michael O’Leary’s can-do attitude and their producing of an answer to every problem raised by the commission did not convince the competition experts in the end.
The commission clearly did not trust Ryanair’s solutions, which included writing a business plan for the company
it would help set up in Ireland to take over the Aer Lingus name on the more contentious routes, give it €100m as
seed capital, and provide it with staff and premises.

The final rejection of Ryanair’s bid leads to the inescapable conclusion that, as long as there are only two major airlines operating in Ireland, one will never be allowed absorb the other.

Leaving the country with just one airline would create a monopoly situation, the commission points out, which is what it is there to prevent.

Ryanair, however, recognised this as the main objection early on and responded by offering to help establish a new company, based in Ireland, to which it would transfer capital, lease several aircraft and airport slots, make a royalty-free, non-sub-licensable, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to the Aer Lingus trademark for three years, together with personnel, contracts, and real estate.

This company would be an offshoot of Flybe UK, the largest British regional operator, which has 73 planes. This compares with Ryanair’s 300-plus and Aer Lingus’s 44 planes.

This would have solved another problem Ryanair faced — the 46 routes on which it and Aer Lingus compete directly. They are the only two carriers serving 28 of these routes and taking Aer Lingus out would leave only Ryanair providing flights.

Ryanair came to an arrangement with Flybe to take over 43 routes for a minimum of three years, basing the aircraft in Dublin and one in Cork. Flybe’s involvement would ensure there were two companies offering consumers a choice, while Ryanair had got an undertaking from BA to take over three remaining such routes.

Ryanair had addressed concerns that Flybe could not afford such a service by offering to provide €100m to Flybe to establish the routes in addition to all the accoutrements of operating an airline.

However, Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said they had examined this solution and found it wanting. He cast doubts on whether Flybe would be able to suddenly become an airline operating larger planes on more routes.

The service Flybe Ireland would offer would require it to develop a new business model, operate aircraft different to its own, taking off without any previous relevant experience operating out of Ireland, or competing with Ryanair.

Offering to write Flybe a business plan "was not reconcilable with the concept of independent competitors", the commission said.


Page 116 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Despite Ryanair’s solution-driven offer of €100m to the airline, the commission said Flybe "did not appear to possess the financial resources necessary to maintain and develop Flybe Ireland as a viable and active competitor".

It also believes the 43 routes Flybe would take over from Aer Lingus would not be profitable and so the company would not have sufficient incentive to continue to operate on a lasting basis, at least on a number of the routes.

It objected to BA/IAG taking over three London routes to Dublin, Cork, and Shannon for three years using Ryanair slots in Gatwick and Heathrow. It also refused the idea of Ryanair giving BA an option to acquire the slots when Ryanair decided to dispose of them. Ryanair would also offer slots to other European carriers.

The commission said these plans would see Ryanair remain dominant on the routes and BA would possibly exit after the three years. At any rate, BA had a different relationship with Ireland — its routes from here are mainly to deliver passengers to its hub in Britain for onwards flights.

The commission said it could not speculate on whether Ryanair could have produced other solutions that would have solved the problems. But it is difficult to conclude anything other than what is needed is a third company, akin to Ryanair and Aer Lingus, based in Ireland, operating a full commercial passenger service, competing with them in every respect.
Then, perhaps, a takeover of one of the airlines by another — still leaving the country with two competing airlines
— could be a possibility, sources said.

The commission was damning in refuting Ryanair’s claims that the acquisition would generate synergies and savings that would benefit consumers. It did not find any significant evidence of this "beyond Ryanair’s mere statements".

On the contrary, the commission said "Ryanair would have eliminated its closest competitor on a significant number of routes", and created a monopoly on 28 routes, a dominant position on 11 routes currently serviced by charter companies, and on a further seven routes where alternatives are offered by other scheduled carriers.

The commission makes the point that it did not just examine Ryanair’s four sets of proposals in response to its objections, but the final three were also market-tested with consumers, tourist agents, and stakeholders, and Ryanair was informed of the results each time.

EU blocks  Ryanair’s  third attempt to purchase  Aer Lingus
358 words
28 February 2013
The Irish Examiner
IRISEX

EU anti-trust regulators have blocked a third bid by  Ryanair to buy rival Aer Lingus,  a ruling that  Europe’s biggest low-cost airline called politically motivated and vowed to challenge in court.

Yesterday, the  European Commission — which in 2007 vetoed  Ryanair’s first takeover bid for  Aer Lingus  — said Ryanair had not offered sufficient concessions to allay fears about the combined company’s dominance or monopoly on 46 routes.

It said the €694m bid, which was opposed by the Government, could hurt competition and lead to more than 11m passengers paying higher prices for flights.

"For [Irish and European passengers], the acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares," said EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

Ryanair — which owns 30% of Aer Lingus and has been battling to buy the 75-year-old former flag carrier to strengthen its market position — had promised to divest some of Aer Lingus’s routes off to Flybe and British Airways in an attempt to win over regulators.
Ryanair yesterday described its concessions as unprecedented and rejected the commission’s arguments.

"We believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition," the airline said.

Ryanair’s appeal could scare off other possible strategic investors in Aer Lingus and frustrate the Government’s efforts to divest its 25% stake in Aer Lingus, as part of the country’s €85bn EU/IMF bailout.
The Government has welcomed the commission’s decision.

"The Government’s view very strongly was that we want to see lots of airlines flying in and out of Ireland, lots of competition, and lots of routes," Transport Minister Leo Varadkar told RTÉ.
"Ryanair spends a lot of time and money in the courts and generally doesn’t get much success from their actions. "But that’s a decision for them," he said of Ryanair’s appeal.
Aer Lingus CEO Christoph Mueller said that Ryanair’s appeal was motivated by a desire to derail a probe undertaken by Britain’s Competition Commission into Ryanair’s stake in thecarrier.

Business - Ryanair to appeal blocked  Aer Lingus  takeover

Ryanair has said it will appeal against the  European Commission's decision to block its attempted takeover of
Aer Lingus.
The budget airline wants to take over the Irish flag carrier of which it already owns a 29.8 per cent share. It accused the European Commission of acting "unjustly" by rejecting its third bid to control Aer Lingus.
The latest attempt had seemed the most likely after Flybe said it would take over around half of Aer Lingus short haul flights.

There was a commitment from the IAG airline group to run overlapping Aer Lingus/Ryanair routes between Dublin and London Gatwick to ensure competition.

However, the European Commission said the takeover would create a monopoly on dozens of routes which it said could lead to higher fares.

Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said the decision was "motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically inspired prohibition".
Aer Lingus said consumers were being better served by vigorous competition set by the two airlines. Chief executive Christoph Mueller said the takeover bid should never have been made.
"The series of inadequate remedy offers presented by Ryanair only underlines the view that Ryanair made its offer without any reasonable belief that it could obtain clearance," he said.

Joaquin Almunia, European Commissioner for competition, said the decision protects more than 11 million Irish and European passengers flying in and out of Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon.
"For them, the acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares," he said. Document IRISHN0020130228e92s0001r

Ryanair shares dip as merger rejected.

Shares in Ryanair and Aer Lingus  experienced differing fortunes in Dublin yesterday after the  European
Commission rejected a proposed merger of the two Irish airlines.

Ryanair’s shares fell by 0.7 per cent while  Aer Lingus’s  finished up 0.4 per cent at the close of trading.
This was the second time in six years that the commission had rejected a bid by Ryanair for Aer Lingus.

“I reached the conclusion that this acquisition could not be allowed,” commission vice-president in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said yesterday.
“Indeed it would have directly harmed passengers, who would have had to pay higher fares as a result.”

The commission concluded that on 28 of the 46 routes on which Ryanair and Aer Lingus compete directly, the merger would have led to a monopoly.
There would also have been constraints on the other routes, it added.

Ryanair had proposed hiving off just more than half of Aer Lingus’s short-haul routes to British Airways and Flybe, but the commission said these remedies were “not sufficient given the seriousness of the competition problems at stake”.
‘Political decision’

Ryanair said the rejection of its offer was a “political decision to pander to the vested interests of the Irish Government . . . and is not one that is based on a fair and reasonable application of EU competition rules”. It said it would appeal the commission’s ruling.

Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller described Ryanair’s proposed remedies as “inadequate”. Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar said the merger would have been “bad for competition in the Irish aviation market”.

Ryanair likely to ditch acquisition as futile strategy.

Different year, same result for  Ryanair in its attempt to take over  Aer Lingus.

Michael O’Leary’s “unprecedented and revolutionary remedies package” to get a deal across the line failed to impress the European Commission, which yesterday formally rejected  Ryanair’s latest takeover attempt just as it did in 2007.
Ryanair blustered yesterday about appealing the commission’s decision but its chances of success seem remote. It failed to overturn the 2007 ruling on appeal.
An appeal would spin this out for an indefinite period, which would be unhelpful to Aer Lingus, given that it would have to keep a team of advisers to shadow Ryanair’s legal moves.

Attention will now switch to whether the UK Competition Commission moves to force Ryanair to divest of its 29.8 per cent shareholding in Aer Lingus.
UK investigation

The UK commission’s investigation began following a referral by the Office of Fair Trading on June 15th last year but was put on ice when Ryanair launched its bid just four days later.

It wasn’t clear last night if, in the event that Ryanair does lodge an appeal to the European Commission’s decision, the UK body would be able to proceed with its investigation or whether it would have to await the outcome of such a challenge.

Aer Lingus has racked up many millions of euro in costs defending itself against three Ryanair takeover bids – O’Leary pulled the plug on his 2009 offer before Brussels had the chance to consider the matter – and would prefer if the whole thing just went away.
The ripples from this latest bid by Ryanair will last for some time.
Aer Lingus was not impressed that its former chief executive Willie Walsh and his International Airlines
Group/British Airways were such willing partners to Ryanair’s takeover bid.
Aer Lingus and BA have a long-standing code-sharing deal that is bound to be soured by the fact that the UK
airline was such an eager participant in O’Leary’s takeover attempt.

Ryanair offered to give up certain routes to London from Irish airports to BA and 43 of Aer Lingus’s short-haul routes to British regional carrier Flybe, which was also to get €100 million in capital to help launch a new business in Ireland.
Ryanair would have taken over the balance of Aer Lingus’s routes, including its long-haul business to the US. Fewer options
“In the end, the most likely outcome of this transaction would have been quite simple: when flying to and from Ireland, passengers wouldn’t have been able to choose between as many options as they can today, and they would have ended up paying higher fares,” was how commission vice-president in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia summed up the proposal yesterday.

For Ryanair, the focus might now turn towards landing a new aircraft deal with Boeing. If it can’t grow by acquisition then it will just have to do so organically.

Losing out on Aer Lingus is undoubtedly a setback for O’Leary, but it’s far from the end of the Ryanair growth story.

Belgium  : Mergers: Commission prohibits Ryanair's  proposed takeover of Aer Lingus
476 words
28 February 2013

The European Commission has prohibited, on the basis of the  EU Merger Regulation, the proposed takeover of the Irish flag carrier  Aer Lingus  by the low-cost airline  Ryanair. The acquisition would have combined the two leading airlines operating from Ireland. The Commission concluded that the merger would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 46 routes where, currently,  Aer Lingus  and
Ryanair compete vigorously against each other. This would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers travelling on these routes. During the investigation,  Ryanair offered remedies. The Commission assessed them thoroughly and carried out several market tests.

Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "The Commission's decision protects more than 11 million Irish and European passengers who travel each year to and from Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon. For them, the acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares. During the procedure, Ryanair had many opportunities to offer remedies and to improve them. However, those proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes."
Ryanair and Aer Lingus are by far the most important carriers operating out of Ireland. They compete directly on
46 routes. It was the third time that the proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair was notified to the
Commission. In 2007 the Commission prohibited Ryanair's first attempt to acquire Aer Lingus (see IP/07/893) and
this decision was upheld by the EU General Court (MEMO/10/300). In 2009, the second notification by Ryanair
was withdrawn.

The Commission took into account the changes in market circumstances since 2007, for example the fact that the market positions of Ryanair and Aer Lingus have become even stronger, with their combined market shares going up from 80% in 2007 to 87% in 2012 for short-haul flights out of Dublin. The number of routes to and from Ireland operated in competition by Ryanair and Aer Lingus has increased from 35 in 2007 to 46 in 2012.
The combination of Ryanair and Aer Lingus would have led to very high market shares on all of these 46 routes: On 28 routes the proposed merger would have created an outright monopoly.
On 11 further routes, the only alleged competitive constraint to the merged entity would have come from charter airlines. However, this constraint would have remained weak because charter airlines have a very different business model.

Finally, on 7 routes Ryanair and Aer Lingus operate alongside other scheduled carriers. In addition to their very high market shares Ryanair and Aer Lingus are very close competitors - if not each other's closest competitors on these routes.

EU antitrust regulators blocked  Ryanair's third attempt to acquire Irish rival  Aer Lingus  yesterday, a ruling that Europe's biggest low-cost airline called politically motivated and vowed to challenge in court. The  European Commission, which vetoed  Ryanair's first takeover bid for  Aer Lingus  in 2007, said the no-frills carrier had not offered sufficient concessions to allay concerns about the merged company's dominance or monopoly on 46 routes. It said the e694 million (R8 billion) bid could hurt competition and lead to higher prices for passengers. "For [Irish and European] passengers, the acquisition of  Aer Lingus  by Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said. - Reuters

Three fund management employees have been arrested in London on suspicion of insider dealing and market abuse after police and regulators launched dawn raids on their homes and offices in the capital, the second such swoop this year. Britain's Financial Services Authority (FSA) said yesterday that the three men, aged 33, 37 and
39, who were not linked to any other current insider dealing investigation, were in custody awaiting questioning. It declined to comment further. The three are London professionals working in the fund management industry and are all employed at firms in the capital, one source with knowledge of the investigation said. The men have not been charged. - Reuters

Tesco would buy more meat from its home market as part of its response to the discovery of horsemeat in beef products that had shaken consumer trust in supermarket supply chains, Britain's biggest retailer said yesterday. "We're going to bring meat production a bit closer to home. We do buy some, particularly for our frozen products, out of Europe, and as we can we'll bring it closer to home," chief executive Philip Clarke told the BBC's Today radio programme. Clarke said Tesco would seek more collaboration and partnerships with British farmers. He said that from July all chicken sold at Tesco's UK stores would come from British farms. - Reuters

RYANAIR has vowed to fight a rejection by  European officials of its renewed takeover bid for  Aer Lingus.

The airline accused the  European Commission of acting unfairly and failing to apply its own competition rules and precedents to the latest takeover plan.

The airline said the takeover bid, rejected yesterday by the EU Commission, was supported by a historic and unprecedented remedies package, which addressed shortcomings in its previous two failed bids.

Aer Lingus chief Christoph Mueller yesterday said the takeover bid should never have been made, adding: 'The series of inadequate remedy offers underlines the view that Ryanair made its offer without any reasonable belief that it could obtain clearance.'
Aer Lingus posted operating profits of €69.1million in 2012. Ryanair owns 29.8 per cent of the company. Document METRO00020130228e92s00017

Acquisitions will support Ryanair long term growth  - Frost & Sullivan’s Lida Mantzavinou comments on
Ryanair being blocked  for taking over Aer Lingus
409 words

London – “Ryanair has been consistently reporting substantial net profits year on year (in exception of 2008) and Frost & Sullivan estimates that the airline is set to report a 5% increase in profit after tax in its full year results in March 2013, in comparison to last year.

Ryanair finds short term solutions to grow. However, the low cost carrier faces difficulties in growing in the long term. Ryanair’s growth is being constrained primarily by the  EU’s denial to approve the  Aer Lingus  take-over (e.g. in 2006/2007, in 2009 and in 2013) that would allow the carrier to expand its fleet, overcoming the lack of new aircraft deliveries that has been already constraining its growth, and benefit from economies of scale, that would further reduce its unit cost and increase revenues.

As more consolidation is expected to take place in the next two years and once airline groups see benefits from their restructuring programs, expected in 2014, competition in the short haul market will intensify, pushing average fares downwards. Ryanair in the short term should seek to grow inorganically through other acquisitions benefiting from the fact that European airlines are currently valued below net asset value (NAV).

Aer Lingus, on the other hand, has successfully marketed itself in the market in order to attract other potential buyers. Aer Lingus has managed to generate net profits in the last 3 years (2010-2012), expanded its code share partnerships, e.g. Jet Blue expected in April, added frequencies to US and expanded network and is still marginally valued below net asset value (NAV). The company is an attractive target for carriers that are eager to have a foothold in the European market and feeding traffic back to Asia through the Middle East, such as Etihad.”

Aer Lingus  welcomes  EC prohibition of Ryanair

STOCK REPORT

[News Story] Dublin & London, 27 February 2013: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") welcomes the decision announced today by the European Commission (EC) prohibiting Ryanair"s offer for Aer Lingus. This is the first occasion on which the EC has needed to block the same deal twice. It is also Ryanair"s third failed offer for Aer Lingus. The full text of the EC"s announcement and frequently asked questions are linked below:

http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-167_en.htm

http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-144_en.htm

The number of routes into and out of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete has sharply increased since the first offer was blocked in 2007, so the repeated prohibition was always to be expected. Aer Lingus is Ryanair"s only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes, and both business and leisure travellers are well served by the vigorous competition that has been preserved between these two carriers.
Aer Lingus recognises the careful and detailed investigation conducted by the EC. Christoph Mueller, CEO of Aer
Lingus, said:

"Aer Lingus" position from the outset has been that Ryanair"s offer should never have been made. The series of inadequate remedy offers presented by Ryanair only underlines the view that Ryanair made its offer without any reasonable belief that it could obtain clearance. "

Aer Lingus continues to cooperate with the UK Competition Commission (UK CC) in its investigation into Ryanair"s 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus. The UK CC investigation began following the referral by the UK"s Office of Fair Trading on 15 June 2012, which observed that "there is a realistic prospect that its stake has resulted or will result in a substantial lessening of competition." The announcement of Ryanair"s bid on 19 June, just four days later, was clearly motivated by a desire to derail the UK CC"s investigation.

Aer Lingus remains focussed on financial and operational performance. Aer Lingus is a much stronger airline today than it was at the time of the previous Ryanair offers. The 2012 preliminary results announced on 6
February 2013 demonstrated that Aer Lingus delivered an excellent overall performance. During 2012, the Company continued to win market share from Ryanair and other competitors, while also increasing operating profit, total revenue, passenger numbers, average yields and load factors. Aer Lingus is well positioned for future growth and continues to implement its successful "value carrier" business model.

EU blocks  Ryanair's  bid to acquire Aer Lingus

EU blocks Ryanair's bid to acquire  Aer Lingus

BRUSSELS (AP) - The European Union's antitrust authority Wednesday blocked  Ryanair's renewed bid to take over rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus,  ruling that it would undermine competition and drive up ticket prices.

The merger of the two Dublin-based airlines would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on almost 50 routes where Aer Lingus and Ryanair currently compete, said the EU Commission, the bloc's executive arm."This would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers traveling on these routes," it said, rejecting the remedies offered by Ryanair in return for a green light to its takeover bid.

Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline and already the biggest shareholder in Aer Lingus, vowed to appeal what it called a "political decision" designed to meet the interests of the Irish government. Its offer valued Aer Lingus at about $900 million ([euro]700 million).
Beer maker's profits go flat

AMSTERDAM (AP) - Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, the world's largest brewer, said Wednesday that profit fell 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter due to higher financing costs, and it forecast weak first- quarter sales volumes in the United States and Brazil.

The maker of Budweiser, Bud Light, Stella Artois and Beck's said net profit was $1.76 billion ([euro]1.35 billion), down from $1.85 billion in the same period a year ago. Exchange rate-linked losses in the fourth quarter of 2012 and gains on derivatives a year earlier caused a combined $400 million downward swing that wiped out savings made through cost cuts.

The company managed to offset a dip in sales volumes in the fourth quarter by hiking prices, leading to an 8.8 percent rise in revenue.

Over the whole of 2012, it said sales volumes had grown in the U.S., its most profitable market, for the first time since 2008 and "market share is showing signs of stabilizing."
Wonder bread has a buyer
NEW YORK (AP) - Wonder bread could start appearing in school lunchboxes again soon.

A person familiar with the situation says a bid by Flowers Foods to buy Wonder and several other bread brands from bankrupt Hostess was met with no competing offers. The individual requested anonymity because the auction process is private.

Hostess hasn't been making any of its cakes and breads since late November, when the company announced it was going out of business and shuttered its plants after years of financial struggles.

The $360 million bid by Flowers also includes Nature's Pride, Butternut, Home Pride and Merita breads. An auction will still be held Thursday for a separate $30 million bid by Flowers for Beefsteak. The source said a competing offer for that brand was submitted by Mexico's Grupo Bimbo, which makes Thomas' English muffins and Entenmann's cakes.
Any sales would be subject to approval by a bankruptcy court March 19. Online gambling heats up
Page 132 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Nevada and New Jersey once had the country to themselves when it came to casino gambling. Now, with the sudden advent of Internet gambling, those states are expected to slug it out again for dominance of the fledgling U.S. online betting market.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed a law Tuesday legalizing Internet betting, days after Nevada did the same. And Delaware could have its online betting operation up and running by late September.
Industry executives say a key to who will dominate the industry will be how online betting is regulated by different states. That, in turn, will affect the interstate compacts that are likely to quickly expand the market.

EU antitrust regulators yesterday formally blocked a third attempt by  Ryanair to buy Irish rival  Aer Lingus,  a ruling Europe's biggest low-cost airline called politically motivated and vowed to challenge in court.

The European Commission, which vetoed  Ryanair's first takeover bid for  Aer Lingus  in 2007, said Ryanair had not offered sufficient concessions to allay concerns about the combined company's dominance or monopoly on
46 routes.

It said the €694m (£601m) bid, which was opposed by the Irish government, could hurt competition and lead to over 11m passengers paying more.

Ryanair, which owns 30 per cent of Aer Lingus and has been battling to buy Ireland's 75-year-old former flag carrier to strengthen its market position, had promised to divest some of Aer Lingus's routes to Flybe and British Airways in an attempt to win over regulators.
Ryanair described its concessions as unprecedented and rejected the Commission's arguments.
"We believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition," it said. Flybe said the concessions "would have afforded credible and robust competition, including new jobs and bases
in Ireland".

RYANAIR has vowed to fight in court a rejection by  European officials of its renewed takeover bid for rival  Aer      Lingus.

The airline accused the  European Commission of acting unfairly and failing to apply its own competition rules and precedents to the latest takeover plan.

"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing."

RYANAIR'S LINGUS BID GOES TO COURT

By LYNDSEY TELFORD  RYANAIR will fight the  EU's rejection of its takeover bid for  Aer Lingus  in the courts.

The airline accused the  European Commission of acting unfairly and failing to apply its own competition rules and precedents.

A spokesman for the no-frills carrier said: "We regret that this prohibition is motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns.
"We have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition."

The airline added the takeover bid, rejected today by the EU Commis-sion, was supported by a historic and unprecedented remedies package.

The "radical" bid included two up-front buyers - BA/IAG and Flybe - to take over around half of Aer Lingus's short-haul business.

The plan - Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary's third for Aer Lingus - appeared to have been boosted earlier this month when Flybe agreed to fly 43 of Aer Lingus' short-haul routes.

There had also been a commitment from the IAG airline group to run overlapping Aer Lingus and Ryanair routes between Dublin and London Gatwick to ensure competition.

COMPETITION watchdogs have grounded  Ryanair's £606million bid to take over Irish rival  Aer Lingus.

The European Commission yesterday blocked the budget airline's attempt to buy the Irish flag carrier, saying it would undermine competition and drive up air fares.
Officials said the merger may have created a stranglehold for Ryanair on nearly 50 routes where it competes with
Aer Lingus. It said: "This would have reduced choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases."

Ryanair, which owns about 30% of Aer Lingus, pledged to appeal, branding the ruling a "politically-inspired prohibition" designed to benefit the Irish government, which owns a quarter of Aer Lingus.

Ryanair to fight EC veto on Aer Lingus  deal

EUROPEAN competition authorities have blocked  Ryanair's attempt to acquire its Irish rival  Aer Lingus, prompting an immediate warning from the low–cost carrier that it will appeal against the "manifestly unjust" and "political" decision.

The European Commission said the €694m (£600m) proposed deal would have "harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 46 routes where, currently,  Aer Lingus  and Ryanair compete vigorously".

Ryanair had sought to alleviate competition concerns by striking a deal with UK regional carrier Flybe, which had agreed to take on 43 Aer Lingus routes if the deal was approved. British Airways–owned IAG had also agreed to operate routes between Ireland and Gatwick airport.

The Commission said it had assessed the remedies offered by Ryanair "thoroughly" and had also carried out several market tests. "However, the remedies proposed fell short of addressing the competition concerns raised by the Commission," it said.
European Competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia added: "The Commission's decision protects more than
11m Irish and European passengers. [Ryanair's] proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious
competition problems which this acquisition would have created."

Ryanair, which has made three attempts to buy Aer Lingus since 2006, said the decision was "political". A spokesman said: "Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal against this manifestly unjust prohibition."

MERGERS : COMMISSION BLOCKS RYANAIR'S AER LINGUS BID

Low-cost airline Ryanair's third bid to take over its main competitor,  Aer Lingus,  was rejected by the European Commission, on 27 February. Indeed, this outcome has been expected since 12 February, when Ryanair announced with a great deal of media coverage that the company expected the €694 million bid would fail - despite its proposed concessions (see  Europolitics 4586).

The EU executive says that the proposed operation would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or dominant position on 46 routes departing from or flying to Ireland, on which the two companies currently compete vigorously against each other. This situation, the Commission said, "would have reduced client choice and, most likely, would have led to price increases for consumers travelling on these routes".

Fearing that if Ryanair and Aer Lingus were to double up their routes, real and potential competition on these lines would disappear, the Commission opened an in-depth inquiry into the proposed merger on 29 August 2012 (4475). It has emphasised that a new dossier was opened for the third takeover bid, and that the situation had been re-examined in the light of the current state of the market.

The Commission's inquiry confirmed the existence of high barriers to entry, stemming particularly from the strong market positions held by Ryanair and Aer Lingus in Ireland. Together, the two companies hold an 87% share in the market.

"The market investigation showed that there was no prospect that any new carrier would enter the Irish market after the merger, in particular by the creation of a base at the relevant Irish airports, and challenge the new entity on a sufficient scale," the Commission concluded, adding that this would considerably reduce travelling options for customers and would have probably led to increases in ticket prices.
INSUFFICIENT CONCESSIONS

"During the procedure, Ryanair had many opportunities to offer remedies and to improve them," emphasised Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia. "However, those proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes."

Ryanair proposed several remedies during the investigation. The first consisted of the divestiture of Aer Lingus' operations on 43 overlap routes to the British regional company Flybe. However, the Commission said that Flybe is not a suitable purchaser capable of competing sufficiently with the Ryanair-Aer Lingus merged entity: firstly because the profitability of these lines for Flybe was not guaranteed, and secondly because it does not have the capital base to absorb such low profitability, or potential losses. Finally, the Commission said Flybe's business model was not compatible with the management of a different network with new planes.

Ryanair also proposed the cession of take-off and landing slots at London airports to IAG-British Airways, so that IAG-British Airways would operate on three routes (Dublin-London, Shannon-London and Cork-London). Flybe and IAG committed to operate the routes for three years. However, the inquiry showed that the merged entity would remain dominant in terms of frequency, seats and routes, and that IAG-British Airways would have little incentive to stay on the routes beyond a three-year period.
RYANAIR SET TO APPEAL

Ryanair now intends to appeal to the EU court against this decision, which it has called "indefensible," and which it says "aims to protect the interests of the Irish government" - which holds 25% of the shares in Aer Lingus. "We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns

Page 142 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition,"
said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely, re-confirming the position the low-cost airline took on 12 February, to which
Commissioner Almunia responded that while the decision was taken by a political organ - ie the Commission - it is
not political in nature, and is based on solid legal and economic arguments, which show the impact on
competition and on European consumers.

Aer Lingus, which has always been opposed to this offer, welcomed the Commission's prohibition of the takeover. The company's CEO, Christoph Mueller, said that consumers were being better served by vigorous competition between the two airlines and that "Aer Lingus' position from the outset has been that Ryanair's offer should never have been made".

Ryanair said the EC's decision was a political one to protect the interests of the Irish Government - which holds a

this month.
It said the package addressed the shortcomings in its previous two failed bids in 2007 and 2012.
Aer Lingus posted strong 2012 results, with operating profit up 41 per cent to 69.1 million euro (£59.5 million). The former flag carrier maintains that Ryanair is its only significant competitor on most routes.

The European Commission on Wednesday formally announced its decision to again block  Ryanair's acquisition of Aer Lingus.

According to prepared remarks from  EC vice president of competition policy Joaquin Almunia for a Wednesday press briefing, the acquisition "would have directly harmed passengers, who would have had to pay higher fares as a result."

EC identified "very significant competition concerns" on 46 routes, including 28 which "would have simply led to a monopoly."

EC deemed the remedies proposed by Ryanair as "not sufficient given the seriousness of the competition problems at stake."
In 2007 it similarly prohibited Ryanair from purchasing its fellow Irish carrier. Ryanair again reiterated its intention to appeal the decision.

Flybe 'disappointed' as EC vetoes Ryanair's  Aer Lingus  bid

The European Commission has rejected  Ryanair's latest takeover bid for  Aer Lingus,  in a move which the budget Irish carrier says it will fight in the courts.

Rynair's "radical" bid had included a 100 million euro deal with Exeterbased Flybe to take over 43 short-haul  Aer   Lingus  routes in order to satisfy competition rules, creating a new business, Flybe Ireland.

Flybe said that it was "disappoin-ted" by the EC's decision and that it remains "firmly" of the view that the Ryanair proposal "would have afforded credible and robust competition, including new jobs and bases in Ireland." Ryanair, which holds a 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus, has accused the EC of political decision-making to protect the interests of the Irish government - which holds a 25% share in the carrier- and not one based on competition rules.

Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said: "We believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturn-ing this politically-inspired prohibition."

Aer Lingus said consumers were being better served by vigorous competition set by the two airlines. Its chief executive Christoph Mueller said: "The series of inadequate remedy offers presented by Ryanair only underlines the view that Ryanair made its offer without any reasonable belief that it could obtain clearance."

Joaquin Almunia, European Commissioner for competition, said the decision would protect more than 11 million passengers flying in and out of Dublin, Cork, Knock and Shannon.
"For them, the acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have most likely led to higher fares," he said.

"During the procedure, Ryanair had many opportunities to offer remedies and to improve them. However, those proposals were simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes."

Ryanair to Appeal EU's Bid Veto

BRUSSELS --  Ryanair Holdings PLC said Wednesday it would appeal the  European Union's decision to block the budget carrier's acquisition of Irish rival  Aer Lingus  Group PLC on the grounds that the merger would stifle competition.

Ryanair said it had offered an "unprecedented" package of concessions in its third attempt to merge with the carrier. It expressed confidence that it could overturn the decision when it filed the appeal to the  EU's General Court in Luxembourg.
The European Commission, which acts as the EU's antitrust watchdog, said earlier Wednesday that it couldn't let
Ryanair's takeover bid go ahead, confirming officially what it had told the airline earlier this month.

The 694 million euros ($906.4 million) takeover would have created a monopoly on dozens of routes where Aer Lingus and Ryanair currently compete directly, and would have been to the detriment of some 11 million passengers traveling to and from Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Knock, the commission said.

"In the end, the most likely outcome of this transaction would have been quite simple. When flying to and from Ireland, passengers would not have been able to choose from as many options as they can today and they would have ended up paying higher fares," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told reporters in Brussels.

Remedies were "simply inadequate to solve the very serious competition problems which this acquisition would have created on no less than 46 routes," Mr. Almunia added.

Mr. Almunia rejected Ryanair's accusation that the decision had been driven by the "vested interests" of the Irish government, which holds a 25% stake in Aer Lingus and which had opposed the bid.

The decision had been based on "very, very solid analysis," both economic and legal, which had found that the market position of the two airlines on routes to and from Ireland was even stronger than in 2007, when Ryanair launched its first merger bid, he said.

Ryanair said it had already begun proceedings to overturn the decision, arguing that it had secured two upfront buyers, regional carrier Flybe Group PLC and British Airways, owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group, for each of the 46 crossover routes, along with other measures that had comprehensively addressed all outstanding antitrust issues cited by regulators.

"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically inspired prohibition," said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely in a statement. "Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal against this manifestly unjust prohibition."

The case will now have to be referred to the General Court in Luxembourg within the next two months, though a decision there would likely take upward of nine months, possibly much longer. The court upheld the commission's
2007 prohibition.

In its latest package of concessions that were offered, Ryanair said, Flybe would have taken over 43 Aer Lingus routes, guaranteeing 20 million euros in annual profit as well as a 100 million euro upfront payment for Flybe.

The aim was to convince the commission that Flybe was a credible competitor to Ryanair despite several profit warnings from Flybe over the past two years and the announcement of cuts to its U.K. workforce last month.
Page 147 of 150 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Ryanair had also proposed transferring all of Aer Lingus's routes between London Gatwick Airport and Ireland to
British Airways.

"The decision doesn't come as a huge surprise; the bid did seem to be a long shot to independent observers," said Antonio Bavasso, a partner at London-based law firm Allen & Overy LLP. "Was Flybe really there to free ride and to be sponsored by Ryanair? Those are legitimate questions for the commission to be asking."

Bruce Kilpatrick, competition partner at Eversheds, said: "The commission's findings that Flybe is not a suitable purchaser capable of competing sufficiently with Aer Lingus and Ryanair and that IAG/BA [British Airways] has little incentive to stay operating the routes beyond an initial three-year period will be key to the appeal."

Aer Lingus Chief Executive Christoph Mueller said the "inadequate" concessions presented by Ryanair showed it had made its offer "without any reasonable belief that it could obtain clearance."

Mr. Almunia rejected Ryanair's accusation that the decision had been driven by the "vested interests" of the Irish government, which holds a 25% stake in Aer Lingus and which had opposed the bid.

The decision had been based on "very, very solid analysis," both economic and legal, which had found that the market position of the two airlines on routes to and from Ireland was even stronger than in 2007, when Ryanair launched its first merger bid, he said.

Ryanair said it had already begun proceedings to overturn the decision, arguing that it had secured two upfront buyers, regional carrier Flybe Group PLC and British Airways, owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group, for each of the 46 crossover routes, along with other measures that had comprehensively addressed all outstanding antitrust issues cited by regulators.

"We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically inspired prohibition," said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely in a statement. "Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal against this manifestly unjust prohibition."

The case will now have to be referred to the General Court in Luxembourg within the next two months, though a decision there would likely take upward of nine months, possibly much longer. The court upheld the commission's
2007 prohibition.

In its latest package of concessions that were offered, Ryanair said, Flybe would have taken over 43 Aer Lingus routes, guaranteeing €20 million in annual profit as well as a €100 million upfront payment for Flybe.

The aim was to convince the commission that Flybe was a credible competitor to Ryanair despite several profit warnings from Flybe over the past two years and the announcement of cuts to its U.K. workforce last month.
Ryanair had also proposed transferring all of Aer Lingus's routes between London Gatwick Airport and Ireland to
British Airways.

"The decision doesn't come as a huge surprise; the bid did seem to be a long shot to independent observers," said Antonio Bavasso, a partner at London-based law firm Allen & Overy LLP. "Was Flybe really there to free ride and to be sponsored by Ryanair? Those are legitimate questions for the commission to be asking."

Bruce Kilpatrick, competition partner at Addleshaw Goddard, said: "The commission's findings that Flybe is not a suitable purchaser capable of competing sufficiently with Aer Lingus and Ryanair and that IAG/BA [British Airways] has little incentive to stay operating the routes beyond an initial three-year period will be key to the appeal."

Aer Lingus Chief Executive Christoph Mueller said the "inadequate" concessions presented by Ryanair showed it had made its offer "without any reasonable belief that it could obtain clearance."
